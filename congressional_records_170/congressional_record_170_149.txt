                   HONORING THE CAREER OF STEVE BAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM BANKS

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Steve 
Baker, longtime principal of Bluffton High School (BHS), who is 
retiring at the end of the school year.
  Steve Baker has dedicated over 25 years as the head of BHS, having 
served the Bluffton-Harrison Metropolitan School District in some 
capacity for a remarkable 40 years. Shortly after college, he began his 
career in Bluffton as a high school math teacher and coach. After 11 
years, he transitioned to become the assistant principal at the middle 
school before returning to the high school as its principal--a role he 
has meritoriously held ever since.
  Under Mr. Baker's leadership, Bluffton High School has achieved 
notable success. The school earned Four Star School standing by the 
Indiana Department of Education five times and was recognized as an 
``A'' school 14 of the last 15 years.
  Beyond his direct responsibilities at BHS, Principal Baker has been a 
continuous advocate for the students of Bluffton. He contributed to 
numerous Indiana Department of Education committees, has advised state 
and federal legislators, and served on the Governor's Indiana 
Educational Roundtable and the Indiana Association of School 
Principals.
  Additionally, Mr. Baker was named the quarterly Principal Advocate 
Champion in 2018 and Indiana State Principal of the Year in 2012 and is 
known throughout northeast Indiana as a trusted and supremely qualified 
voice on education.
  Alongside this long list of accolades and achievements, Principal 
Baker's students, staff, and fellow principals will remember his 
mentorship, warmth, and unwavering dedication to his school. He leaves 
a tremendous legacy and big shoes to fill at Bluffton High School.
  It is an honor to present this official congressional document as a 
token of appreciation for his exceptional service to our community. I 
wish Principal Baker the best as he heads into retirement with his wife 
and family.

                        HONORING RANDY KENDRICK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEBBIE LESKO

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Randy Kendrick 
for her many years of support and commitment to Arizona and our Nation.
  For as long as I have known her, Randy has been a strong advocate and 
supporter of candidates and organizations that promote the values and 
principles that have made our Nation great.
  In the early 2000s, I met Randy while I served as a Member-at-Large 
on the Board of Directors of the Arizona Federation of Taxpayers, an 
organization that fought for low-taxes, opposed wasteful government 
spending, and supported free-market principles.
  Randy not only advocates for common-sense policies like these in 
Arizona, but she supports conservative candidates, especially women 
candidates, from across the country. Before I ran for Congress, I 
attended events at Randy and Ken Kendrick's home, where Randy hosted 
conservative women candidates running for federal office.
  When I ran for Congress, Randy was there to support and encourage me.
  As I end my time in Congress, I want to thank Randy Kendrick for her 
passion, encouragement and support for not only me, but for the 
countless number of people and projects she has had a positive impact 
on throughout Arizona and the United States.
  I know Randy cares about the future of our state and Nation. I can 
hear it when I talk to her. She is a true American patriot and for that 
I am truly grateful.
  May God continue to bless Randy and her family now and for evermore.

                          ____________________

        THANKING DALVINDER MULTANI FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BRYAN STEIL

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dalvinder Multani, who 
recently retired after 20 years of serving the House, five years as a 
Software AG contractor and fifteen years as the Director of Legislative 
Information Management Systems (LIMS) in the Office of the Clerk. In 
his job as the director of LIMS, Dal lead a team of highly skilled 
professionals responsible for developing, maintaining and supporting 
one of the most important applications used in the House, a system that 
records and tracks all legislative activities, creates official 
records, and disseminates legislative data to our partners, the Senate, 
the Government Publishing Office, and the Library of Congress's 
Congress.gov platform.
  As the one in charge of LIMS, it was his duty to make certain that 
LIMS was operational and fully supported each and every day. Dal's 
depth and breadth of expertise in the products he managed as well as 
his understanding of the legislative process was invaluable in 
navigating multitudes of complex changes required of LIMS over the 
years of his tenure. He could always be counted on to respond to 
support requests in a timely and accurate manner, often during late 
nights and weekends. Dal was and is a consummate professional, exceled 
at his craft, and understood the importance of his mission to serve the 
House. He was always proud to serve this great institution.
  Dal looks forward to retirement and spending time with his wife and 
family, traveling to our national parks, and dedicating more time to 
his second passion: performing arts and theatrical work. I wish 
Dalvinder Multani many years of health and a well-earned retirement. 
Congratulations to Dal.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional

commitment to service throughout her life has impacted many lives.
  Shamp has called Arizona her home for over 30 years, earning degrees

Legislature, where she has served as Vice Chairman of the Health and 
Human Services Committee and as a member of the Finance and Commerce

HONORING THE SAN JOSE DE GRACIA CHURCH AND THE COMMUNITY OF LAS TRAMPAS

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the community of 
Las Trampas, and the generations of New Mexicans who built, maintained, 
and protected the San Jose de Gracia Church. The community of Trampas 
was settled in 1751 by 12 Spanish families who painstakingly carved out 
an existence in one of the most beautiful parts of our state and 
country. They relied on the strength of family, the power of community, 
and faith in God; so much so, that after more than 10 years of 
backbreaking work they raised up the San Jose de Gracia Church. The 
church, which is designated as a National Historic Landmark, is 
approaching its 250th anniversary.
  After spending nearly a decade handcrafting, carving, shaping, 
lifting, and tenderly decorating; the community of Las Trampas spent 
the next 250 years upkeeping this gem of 18th Century culture, 
architecture, and faith. For 250 years, it was their faith that kept 
the candles burning, the vigas and planks intact, and the adobe plaster 
fresh and strong. For 250 years this community has worked as one to 
preserve their faith and heritage in such a way that is unmistakably 
New Mexican--and unmistakably a reflection of unwavering faith in God 
and in one another. The San Jose de Gracia Church is the only 
distinctly Spanish Colonial building that remains completely intact 
within the original historic district of Las Trampas.
  Walking in, you are reminded of the original builders, members of the 
community from all walks of life, the fathers and mothers, the sons and 
daughters who lent any talent they could to their community for the 
sake of honoring God and creating a remarkable place to worship. The 
original floorboards, under which are buried countless members of the 
Trampas Community creak and pop as you approach the original 18th 
century altar. The altar, which is covered in frescos, is unlike 
anything else standing in this country--and still vibrant enough today 
to steal the breath and inspire awe from all who behold it. In addition 
to the faith that it has taken for a community to continue such 
painstaking work for so long--I also wish to honor the love that it 
took to keep this church alive. It is love that makes it more than just 
a structure, but a symbol of resilience, survival, and compassion. I 
wish that every single American could open their heart and draw from 
that example as we live and work with one another today and into the 
future.
  For the countless hours spent on its construction, for the countless 
hands that plastered its 6-foot-thick adobe walls, for the thousands of 
hearts that looked to God for salvation in its pews, and for the 250 
years that it has graced the mountains of northern New Mexico, I honor 
the San Jose de Gracia Church, and the community of Las Trampas. Mr. 
Speaker, members of Congress of the United States of America, I also 
pray that God grants at least 250 more.

  HONORING SOPHIA SORIANO'S COMMITMENT TO COMBATING THE OPIOID CRISIS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANGIE CRAIG

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sophia Soriano, who 
worked in partnership with her peers to put together a Fight Back 
Against Fentanyl PSA.
  Sophia is from St. Paul, Minnesota. She has proven her commitment to 
combating the opioid crisis through her advocacy and work with the 
Devin Norring Foundation. The Devin Norring Foundation was established 
to honor Devin's legacy and raise awareness about the dangers of 
illicit drugs and fentanyl.
  On April 4, 2020, Devin passed away from fentanyl poisoning. He was 
seeking relief from blackout migraines and dental pain. He bought what 
he thought was Percocet marketed by a drug dealer on Snapchat. That 
pill turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl.
  Devin was 19 years old.
  The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Sophia, produced an 
impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl. In turning 
grief into activism, Sophia has shown strength and courage beyond her 
years. I am proud to have her as an ally in this fight against the 
fentanyl crisis.
  I thank Sophia for demonstrating a commitment to combating the opioid 
crisis.

congratulate Mannion's Irish Pub and Restaurant on their 25th 
anniversary. I am extremely honored to be able to celebrate this 
impressive milestone with Mannion's and the Somerville Community. 
Mannion's Irish Pub and Restaurant harbors a warm environment where 
food, music, conversation, and laughter all find a home.
  For the past 25 years, Mannion's has showed its commitment by serving 
authentic Irish specialties and fostering a ``proper Irish pub'' by 
ensuring friendly service, making it feel as if you are entering not 
just a restaurant, but also a home.
  As we look back on the past 25 years of Mannion's, they have exceeded 
the expectation of what an Irish pub can provide for a community. I am 
honored to have such an amazing establishment in New Jersey's 7th 
Congressional District, and I look forward to what is to come.

raising the minimum wage, expanding public health services, raising 
green building standards, and fighting for workers' and tenants' 
rights.
  Max was known by his friends and family as a ``Renaissance man'' who 
loved the outdoors, travel, history, and science. He is survived by his 
loving wife Linda Olivenbaum and daughter Marisha Anderson.
  Max Anderson was a beloved husband, father, brother, uncle, friend, 
and community leader. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him and 
all whose lives have been touched by his great contributions to our 
community. Berkeley is a better place because of his incredible 
leadership and dedication to his community. May he rest in eternal 
peace and power.

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Claire Nash, a 
longtime resident of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, who will celebrate her 
100th birthday in October. Claire is a beloved member of the Wolfeboro 
community whose giving heart continues to touch the lives of all who 
have come to know her. Today, I honor Claire for her steadfast 
commitment to spreading love and joy throughout her community.
  Claire is loved throughout Wolfeboro and the towns surrounding it. 
Those who know her best would likely agree that it is better to 
describe her as 100 years young, not old. Everywhere she goes, she 
brings with her the exuberance and energy of the youngest at heart. As 
we celebrate Claire's 100th birthday, we recognize her unwavering 
dedication to her community and her continued contributions to the 
lives of countless others.
  Claire has long been passionate about crochet and other hand crafts, 
skills she perfected over the years and continues to share with the 
world. Through the years, Claire has handmade and gifted countless 
quilts, pillows, and other crafts to the Police Department, Fire 
Department, Children's Center, veterans and many other local 
organizations in and around Wolfeboro. In all she does, she inspires us 
with an enduring legacy of caring, creativity, and selflessness.
  On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional 
District, I wish Claire a happy and healthy 100th birthday. We thank 
her for bringing so much happiness and caring to her community and for 
her continued commitment to the people of New Hampshire.

              HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF LIVING JAZZ

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th 
anniversary of Living Jazz and their steadfast commitment to jazz 
rooted music education and performance programs for the San Francisco 
Bay Area. I want to congratulate Founder Stacey Hoffman and new 
Executive Director Lyz Luke on building and cultivating an organization 
that identifies and supports areas of need for all ages in music and 
performance. Their combined passions have had an immeasurable impact on 
the music culture in our community.

[[Page E958]]

  Founded in 1984, Living Jazz has worked tirelessly to provide access 
to transformative programming that not only preserves and promotes the 
music, spirit, and culture of jazz in the Bay Area, but fosters an 
eminent and vibrant sense of community and shared humanity among all 
who take part. All ages, all abilities, all backgrounds are represented 
in their dynamic offerings, as the programs of Living Jazz are known 
not only for their artistic quality, but also for their commitment to 
build community based on diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. The 
distinctive way in which Living Jazz encourages and supports artists of 
all skill levels and the artistic and personal growth they foster in 
participants has bolstered the cultural ecosystem of the areas they 
serve for the last 40 years.
  Living Jazz has developed a reputation for designing and launching 
programs that go on to become Bay Area treasures, as well as for 
incubating programs to the point of maturity at which time they 
successfully spin off to stand on their own and continue to develop and 
grow independently.
  During the pandemic, Hoffman and Luke ensured the survival of Living 
Jazz by identifying and securing relief funds and pivoting all programs 
to online, and even launching new programs focused on imminent mental 
wellness needs as a response to social isolation. Luke launched the 
Living Jazz Pickup Sessions to address serious issues around Oakland 
food insecurity and, in the summer of 2021, Living Jazz was able to 
safely and successfully bring back the internationally recognized in-
person summer programs--Jazz Camp West and Jam Camp West.
  The organization's jazz-rooted performing arts education programs 
have expanded rapidly with the Living Jazz Children's Project in 14 
underserved East Bay schools. Living Jazz is launching new mentorship 
programs, reigniting localized jam sessions, and renewed partnerships 
with local schools and businesses.
  It has been a fantastic journey watching Living Jazz support and 
transform the lives of people of all ages over the years. Their work 
honors the Black roots of the artform and continues to inspire 
generations of musicians. I thank Living Jazz for their dedication and 
commitment to music education. I want to wish Living Jazz the best of 
luck in their continued success. On behalf of the 12th Congressional 
District of California, I am proud to honor Living Jazz for their 
tremendous achievements. Congratulations on 40 years.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL SHAWN D. DILLON, PROUD RESIDENT OF OKLAHOMA 
  CITY, OKLAHOMA, FOR HIS DISTINGUISHED 20-YEAR CAREER IN THE UNITED 
                              STATES ARMY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel 
Shawn D. Dillon of Oklahoma City on his retirement from the United 
States Army after a distinguished 20-year career.
  Lieutenant Colonel Dillon's service in the United States Army began 
after graduating from Wentworth Military Academy where he was a 
Macarthur Awardee and the Tedd Messmore Honor Graduate. In 2004, he 
graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University and 
entered Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Second Lieutenant 
Dillon went on to serve as a fire support officer in 4th Squadron, 7th 
Cavalry. After being promoted to First Lieutenant, he then went on to 
serve as the executive officer of B and E Companies in 2nd Battalion, 
39th Infantry. From 2010 to 2012, he served as the battery commander in 
charge of 160 field artillery soldiers responsible for the headquarters 
support of a M777 Field Artillery Battalion in Colorado and Afghanistan 
for 2nd Battalion 77th Field Artillery Regiment, and the office-in-
charge of Torkham Gate strategic port of entry from Pakistan. In 2015, 
Captain Dillon was selected to instruct English Composition and 
Literature at West Point Military Academy. From 2017 to 2018, Major 
Dillon served as the operations officer for a 400-soldier Multiple 
Launch Rocket System Battalion, preparing the battalion for deployment 
to Korea. Major Dillon was subsequently selected for the 75th Fire 
Brigade as the executive officer, and then hand-selected to be the fire 
support officer to manage fire support functions and operational plans 
for the largest field artillery brigade in the United States Army, with 
over 3500 soldiers. In this position, he developed and executed the 
largest combined, live, and virtual exercise in over five years, 
incorporating nearly 1,000 soldiers, to prepare the brigade for 
deployment in support of Operation Spartan Shield in 2020-2021. In 
2020, Lieutenant Colonel Dillon became the division chief for the Army 
MultiDomain Targeting Center, responsible for building an Army-wide 
targeting enterprise of over 40 organizations and thousands of soldiers 
and civilians.
  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel Dillon demonstrated 
remarkable leadership and dedication, participating in deployments to 
Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A lifelong learner, Lieutenant Colonel 
Dillon earned his Master of Arts in English Language and Literature 
from the University of Central Oklahoma and attended the United States 
Army Command and General Staff College.
  Mr. Speaker, we extend our heartfelt appreciation to Lieutenant 
Colonel Shawn Dillon for his exceptional service and unwavering 
dedication to our Nation. His remarkable career and leadership in the 
Army significantly contributed to our Nation's defense. As he continues 
to serve his community in new ways, we commend him for his achievements 
and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Lieutenant Colonel Dillon a 
happy retirement as we celebrate his legacy of selfless service to the 
Nation. Lieutenant Colonel Shawn Dillon's outstanding contributions and 
steadfast commitment have left an indelible mark on the United States 
Army and our Nation. His dedication to duty serves as an inspiration to 
all who follow in his footsteps.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional 
District, I would like to recognize State Representative David 
Livingston for his dedication to our community and the people of 
Arizona.
  Representative Livingston began to call Arizona his home in 1983 and 
graduated from Arizona State University in 1988. He then built a 
successful financial consulting business, where he proudly served the 
Peoria community for over two decades. In 2012, he started in the State 
Legislature, representing the northwest valley--first in the House, and 
then in the Senate, where he was selected as Majority Whip for the 
Republican Caucus. He later returned to the House where he currently 
serves.
  Throughout his tenure, he has played a critical role in passing many 
important pieces of legislation, including a balanced budget for the 
state. He also chaired several committees, including the Finance and 
Transportation Committees in the Senate, and the Appropriations and 
Finance Insurance and Banking Committees in the House.
  I thank Representative Livingston for his service to Arizona.

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
40th anniversary of Acts Full Gospel Church located in Oakland, 
California.
  As this occasion also marks his 40th Pastoral Anniversary, I want to 
congratulate the church's founder, Bishop Bob Jackson, for his enduring 
service and commitment to the East Bay community.
  Deriving from a small bible study, the church held its first service 
on May 6, 1984, with just 15 members. Four decades later, Acts Full 
Gospel Church has a congregation of more than 6,000 members, with 30 
ministries diligently working to improve the lives of Oaklanders.
  As Senior Pastor, Bishop Bob Jackson has continuously used his 
platform to give back to those in need. Working alongside his wife, 
First Lady Barbara Jackson, they have made Acts Full Gospel Church a 
community pillar.
  Additionally, he has founded several non-profits, educational 
institutions, and small businesses. This list includes, the Acts 
Christian Academy, Men of Valor Academy, Acts Anointed Acres, Oakland 
African American Chamber of Commerce, Oakland House of Ruth, amongst 
others.
  In his establishment of the Acts Community Development, Inc., he has 
also developed 59 units of affordable housing in Oakland. Given the 
significant need in the Bay Area, he is currently working to develop 58 
more.
  In his spare time, Bishop Bob Jackson also holds several leadership 
positions in local organizations, including serving as the Chairman of 
Oakland's Chapter of the Our Kids ``OK'' Program. In this role, he 
helps empower young Black men and boys to transform their communities 
via their unique mentorship program.
  Through his incredible work and commitment to Oakland, in 2022, 
Bishop Bob Jackson was awarded the President's Lifetime Achievement 
Award--one of the nation's highest civilian honors.
  Therefore, it brings me great joy to celebrate Bishop Bob Jackson, 
and the entire Acts Full Gospel congregation. I am tremendously 
grateful for their 40 years of service to the East Bay community and 
wish them continued success.

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Caden 
Norring, who worked in partnership with his peers to put together a 
Fight Back Against Fentanyl PSA.
  Caden is from Hastings, Minnesota. His brother, Devin, was an honors 
student who loved playing football, making music and skateboarding.
  On April 4, 2020, Caden and his family lost Devin to fentanyl 
poisoning. He was seeking relief from blackout migraines and dental 
pain. He bought what he thought was Percocet marketed by a drug dealer 
on Snapchat. That pill turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl.
  Devin was 19 years old.
  The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Caden, produced an 
impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl. In turning 
his grief into activism, Caden has shown strength and courage beyond 
his years. I am proud to have him as a constituent and an ally in this 
fight against the fentanyl crisis.
  I thank Caden for sharing Devin's story and demonstrating a 
commitment to combating the opioid crisis.

 RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVE GEANIE MORRISON FOR 26 YEARS 
                           OF PUBLIC SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Honorable 
Geanie W. Morrison, whose extraordinary 26-year career of public 
service to the Crossroads region and the state of Texas is coming to a 
close. Throughout her 13-term career in the Texas Legislature, 
Representative Morrison has exemplified dedication, leadership, and a 
tireless commitment to improving the lives of all Texans.
  Since her election in 1999, Representative Morrison has represented 
Texas' 30th District in the Texas House of Representatives which today 
includes DeWitt, Goliad, Jackson, Lavaca, Matagorda, Victoria counties. 
Over the course of her tenure, she has become a trusted leader in the 
Capitol and a steadfast advocate for her constituents.
  Representative Morrison's legislative record is filled with notable 
achievements, but one of her most profound and life-saving 
contributions is her authorship of the country's first Safe Haven 
``Baby Moses'' law, passed in 1999. This legislation provides a 
compassionate and responsible alternative for desperate mothers who may 
otherwise feel they have no choice but to abandon their newborns. 
Through the Safe Haven law, mothers are given the option to safely and 
legally surrender their babies at designated locations, such as 
hospitals or fire stations, without fear of prosecution.
  This law has had an immeasurable impact on saving lives. Since its 
passage, hundreds of newborns across Texas have been safely 
surrendered, and all 50 states have since implemented similar measures. 
Thanks to Representative Morrison's initiative, countless lives have 
been saved and will continue to be.

[[Page E960]]

  Her work in higher education has been impactful to Texas as well. As 
Chair of the House Committee on Higher Education, she played a pivotal 
role in the expansion of the University of Houston-Victoria into a 
four-year institution, significantly increasing access to higher 
education for students in the region. Her efforts have been recognized 
by many, including the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which 
awarded her the Leadership Star Award. She has also been named 
Legislator of the Year by the Texas Association of Student Financial 
Aid Administrators and honored with the Texas Community College 
Teachers Association Legislator of the Year Award.
  Beyond her legislative work, Representative Morrison has always been 
deeply committed to community service. Her 17-year involvement with the 
Junior League of Victoria allowed her to lead programs like ``Making 
the Grade'' and ``Great Expectations,'' where she worked with young 
people to inspire academic success and provide support for pregnant 
teens in completing their education. Her leadership in these 
initiatives has touched countless lives and opened doors of opportunity 
for those who need it most.
  Representative Morrison's service extended beyond her district and 
into key leadership positions at the state level. Prior to running for 
office, she served as Executive Director of the Governor's Commission 
for Women under Governor George W. Bush, and she was appointed to the 
Texas Commission for Volunteerism and Community Service and the Texas 
Juvenile Probation Commission.
  Her long-standing dedication to public service has earned her 
numerous awards, including the Boy Scouts of America South Texas 
Council's Distinguished Citizen Award, the Victoria Chamber of Commerce 
Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award, and recognition as one of South 
Texas' Women of the Year. These accolades are a testament to her 
unwavering commitment to her constituents and her deep-rooted belief in 
the importance of community involvement.
  As Representative Morrison embarks on this new chapter of her life, 
it is my honor to recognize her remarkable career and thank her for her 
faithful service to Texas. We are better off having had someone of 
Geanie's caliber involved in public service. May God bless her and her 
family in the days and years ahead.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional 
District, I would like to recognize State Representative Austin Smith.
  Smith is a fifth-generation Arizonan and began his involvement in 
political activism in 2016, when he helped to foster a strong 
conservative network in Arizona. In 2022, he started a career in public 
service of his own, when he won a seat for Legislative District 29 in 
the Arizona House of Representatives.
  In his first term in the Arizona Legislature, Smith served as Vice 
Chairman of the Natural Resources, Energy, and Water Committee and has 
been outspoken on many issues that are vital for the future of our 
great state, including water conservation, border security, Second 
Amendment rights, economic growth, and life.
  Representative Smith's commitment to preserving the state he and his 
family love so much is admirable, and I am thankful for his service to 
Arizona.

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Mrs. Esmeralda 
Hetrick for her continuous, tireless and dedicated service to the 
community--and for earning the Estamos Unidos Lifetime Achievement 
Award.
  Esmeralda Hetrick was born in Texas as one of six children--where 
they lived on welfare and government assistance--but fortunately had an 
amazing mother that instilled integrity, values, hard-work and a strong 
belief in God in her children. She was the first in her family to 
graduate post-secondary education earning a bachelor's degree and an 
MBA. Esmeralda married in her twenties but her late husband, Max's 
tragic death left her a widow and single mother with a five-year old to 
raise. She then moved to Pennsylvania in 1988, where she's found her 
home.
  Esmeralda worked as a Health Equity Consultant for an insurance 
company where she influenced corporate strategy, product development, 
and healthcare disparity issues, while leading the community outreach 
and small business minority procurement of the company. Her expertise 
enabled the insurance company, to tailor effective messages and ad 
campaigns to inform the community of their healthcare options. Perhaps 
most importantly, she mentored disadvantaged Pennsylvanian students to 
help create future leaders. Mrs. Hetrick also owns an English and 
Spanish newspaper, La Voz Latina Central of PA, and is the personal 
talent manager for her husband Graham S. Hetrick, a Dauphin County 
Coroner who has a TV show ``The Coroner--I Speak For the Dead.''
  Her continuous community efforts garnered media attention and 
positioned her as a go-to spokeswoman in Pennsylvania--earning her 
selection in the 2005 YWCA ``Women of Excellence'', her selection in 
the 2006 Harrisburg Magazine's ``Movers and Shapers'', a feature story 
in 2009 in the first Issue of ``Women Connect--Connecting Women All 
Over the World'', and the Jefferson Award Medal for Public Service in 
2006, 2007, and 2009. She is also just the third person to receive the 
Estamos Unidos Lifetime Achievement Award--an award serving for serving 
the Latino Hispanic community for at least 15 years--it's certainly 
well-earned.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and privileged recognize Mrs. Esmeralda 
Hetrick for her tireless service to Central Pennsylvania in her myriad 
roles, and her earning of the Estamos Unidos Lifetime Achievement 
Award. Her dedicatIon to family, community, and country is the standard 
by which we should all be judged--and I wish her contInued success in 
all her endeavors.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of a civil rights icon, a fearless truthteller, this 
country's ``Father of Black Studies,'' Dr. Nathan Hare.
  Born on April 9, 1933, Dr. Hare was a son of Oklahoma sharecroppers. 
Academically gifted, he excelled through the state's segregated school 
system, earning a bachelor's degree from Langston University. He went 
on to receive a master's degree and Ph.D. in Sociology from the 
University of Chicago, finishing his education with a second Ph.D. in 
clinical psychology at the California School of Professional 
Psychology.
  Throughout his academic and professional career, Dr. Hare was a 
champion of Black history and power. In 1965, as a professor at Howard 
University, he published ``The Black Anglo-Saxons,'' the first of his 
many ground-breaking works.
  In 1968, he arrived at San Francisco State University, where he 
sought to develop an interdisciplinary program dedicated to 
understanding the Black experience. After significant pushback from the 
university's administration, which resulted in a five-month strike with 
students and faculty, Dr. Hare completed the proposal for the program. 
With its adoption, Dr. Hare became the first head of a Black Studies 
Department in the United States
  In 1969, Dr. Hare co-founded the Black Scholar magazine. Through this 
publication,

[[Page E961]]

he granted me the privilege of writing an edition about the Non-Aligned 
Movement. The Conference on Non-Aligned Nations was held in Havana, 
Cuba and I received credentials as a journalist to cover this impactful 
summit on behalf of the Black Scholar and the Sun Reporter newspaper.
  He also asked me to write an article about the nonviolent revolution 
in Grenada. Through our friendship, work, and his mentorship, he taught 
me what a Black perspective on foreign policy and international 
relations meant as an African American. For this, I am deeply grateful.
  Dr. Hare was preceded in death by his loving wife, Dr. Julia (Reed) 
Hare, an activist and scholar who joined him on the frontlines of his 
academic efforts. In 1979, they founded a research institution, called 
the Black Think Tank, where they wrote several books about Black life 
in America.
  Dr. Nathan Hare was an incredible scholar, whose contributions to 
Black academia and media have made a lasting impact on our world. He 
will be greatly missed by those who had the honor of knowing him and 
remembered by all who stand upon his shoulders. May he rest in eternal 
peace and power.

                  HONORING MAJOR THOMAS ``TK'' KENNEDY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MICHAEL LAWLER

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Major Thomas 
``TK'' Kennedy, a true son of Rockland County, whose unwavering 
dedication to serving his country with valor and distinction is a 
shining example of patriotism.
  Born in Suffern, New York, and raised in New York City, Tom was the 
youngest of three boys. He loved to play hockey, playing for the Ramapo 
Saints, followed by Don Bosco Preparatory School, and eventually as 
part of the Black Knights of the United States Military Academy at West 
Point, where he graduated in June 2000.
  On August 8, 2012, Major Kennedy tragically lost his life in Kunar 
Province, Afghanistan, when a Taliban suicide bomber struck while he 
was escorting a group to a provincial governor's meeting. His sudden 
departure left a void that can never be filled. He left behind his 
wife, Kami, and their twins, who were just weeks shy of their second 
birthday.
  Throughout his distinguished military career, Major Kennedy earned an 
impressive array of awards and service medals, including two Bronze 
Star Medals, a Purple Heart and Bronze Star posthumous, two Meritorious 
Service Medals, three Army Commendation Medals, and three Army 
Achievement Medals, among many others. His dedication to his country 
and his fellow soldiers will always be remembered.
  We honor Major Thomas ``TK'' Kennedy for his ultimate sacrifice and 
service and remember him as a loving husband, father, and hero who gave 
everything for his country. His sacrifice is a solemn reminder of the 
weight of service bore by our brave soldiers.

                  RECOGNIZING PASTOR CALVIN CREWS, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
life of one of my constituents, Reverend Dr. Vassar Calvin Crews, Jr., 
a dedicated servant of God, a distinguished Veteran, and a pillar in 
his community.
  Following his high school education in Lynchburg, VA, Reverend Crews 
pursued an Electronics Engineering program at Central Virginia 
Community College before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in 1970. He served 
honorably as a Fire Control Technician aboard the nuclear-powered 
submarine, USS James Madison, SSBN 627 Blue Crew. After four years of 
service at sea, he was stationed in Virginia Beach, where he 
simultaneously pursued a degree in Electrical Engineering Technology 
from Old Dominion University.
  It was during his time in Virginia Beach that Reverend Crews 
recommitted his life to God, a decision that would shape his future and 
calling. Following his discharge from the Navy in 1979, he moved to New 
Jersey and later to Pinellas Park, Florida, where his faith continued 
to guide him. At Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, he served in 
numerous leadership roles, including as Choir Director, Trustee Board 
Member, and Sunday School Superintendent. Reverend Crews's dedication 
to education and ministry was evident throughout his life. He earned 
multiple degrees, including a B.S. in Engineering Technology from the 
University of South Florida, a B.A. and M.A. from Florida Beacon Bible 
College, and a Ph.D. from Andersonville Theological College and 
Seminary. Licensed as a minister in 1986, he was ordained in 1988 and 
installed as Pastor of Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in January 
1989, where he faithfully led his congregation until September of 2024. 
Reverend Crews's legacy is marked by his deep faith, his commitment to 
education, and his unwavering service to his community and to his 
country. He is a man of conviction and compassion who has touched the 
lives of many through his ministry and mentorship. As we honor his 
lifetime of service, let us celebrate a life well-lived and a calling 
answered. Dr. Calvin Crews, Jr.'s impact will continue to resonate 
through those who served. May we all strive to serve our communities 
with the same dedication and humility.

                   HONORING THE LIFE OF CAROL CHRIST

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
achievements of Carol Christ as she celebrates her retirement from the 
University of California, Berkeley after serving as Chancellor of the 
university since 2017. I honor Chancellor Christ for her dedication to 
this distinguished university in California's 12th district and wish 
her the best of luck in her retirement.
  Carol Christ has had an incredible career in higher education that 
has made a lasting impact on the Berkeley community. Before becoming 
Chancellor, Christ was a professor and administrator at UC Berkeley for 
more than thirty years, serving as executive vice chancellor and 
provost from 1994 to 2000. During that time, she was the highest-
ranking female administrator at the university. She then served as the 
president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 before returning to 
Berkeley as the director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education 
and interim executive vice chancellor and provost in the years leading 
up to her being named chancellor.
  Christ received her Bachelor of Arts from Douglass College and her 
Master's degree and Ph.D. in English from Yale University. In 1970, she 
joined UC Berkeley's faculty in the English department, focusing on 
Victorian literature. She later served as both chair of the department 
and dean of the Division of Humanities.
  As Chancellor, Christ has been a champion of women's issues and 
diversity on UC Berkeley's campus. She has fostered a positive campus 
climate for students, staff, and faculty of all backgrounds. She has 
addressed critical issues such as the housing shortage and has embraced 
and celebrated UC Berkeley's spirit and commitment to free speech.
  I am happy to congratulate Carol Christ on her retirement from the 
University of California, Berkeley. Christ has made a lasting positive 
impact on UC Berkeley and California's 12th Congressional District, and 
I honor and thank her for her continued contributions to our community.

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Brooke 
Severson, who worked in partnership with her peers to put together a 
Fight Back Against Fentanyl PSA.
  Brooke is from Cottage Grove, Minnesota. She has proven her 
commitment to combating the opioid crisis through her advocacy and work 
with the Devin Norring Foundation. The Devin Norring Foundation was 
established to honor Devin's legacy and raise awarenessy about the 
dangers of illicit drugs and fentanyl.
  On April 4, 2020, Devin passed away from fentanyl poisoning. He was 
seeking relief from blackout migraines and dental pain. He bought what 
he thought was Percocet marketed by a drug dealer on Snapchat. That 
pill turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl.
  Devin was 19 years old.
  The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Brooke, produced an 
impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl. In turning 
grief into activism, Brooke has shown strength and courage beyond her 
years. I am proud to have her as a constituent and an ally in this 
fight against the fentanyl crisis.
  I thank Brooke for demonstrating a commitment to combating the opioid 
crisis.

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the vital 
contributions of nephrology nurses and address the profound impact 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has on the Greater Philadelphia Community. 
Nephrology nurses are critical to the support and care of patients who 
suffer with CKD and often go above and beyond to meet their patients' 
needs. Recognizing their critical work, I am proud to support the 
designation of September 8-14, 2024, as National Nephrology Nurses 
Week.
  CKD statistics are staggering: about 1 in 7 Americans are affected by 
chronic kidney disease, over 1.8 million people in Pennsylvania alone. 
We must provide the necessary education and care to this vulnerable 
population and their families and recognize the significance of the 
nurses who practice in all areas of nephrology.
  Nephrology nurses practice in countless different areas as they care 
for patients with CKD, such as inpatient (hospital) and outpatient 
hemodialysis, transplantation, home therapy, pediatric dialysis, and 
CKD education. Nephrology nurses' responsibilities include care 
coordination, outcome management, supervision and delegation, patient-
centered

[[Page E963]]

care, interdisciplinary collaboration, and focused, one-on-one teaching 
of patients, their families, and their support systems.
  I call upon all members of our community to join me in celebrating 
the strength, courage, and dedication of nephrology nurses. Let us 
honor those who care for this patient population in the Greater 
Philadelphia area and reaffirm our commitment to supporting these 
dedicated nurses.
  Congress should also support the designation of September 8-14, 2024, 
as National Nephrology Nurses Week. Together, let us acknowledge the 
role of these nurses in our community regarding the care and support of 
those with CKD.
  I encourage all individuals to learn more about chronic kidney 
disease and the impact it has on our health system and our population 
in Pennsylvania, as well as celebrate the invaluable impact made by 
nephrology nurses.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brigadier General 
Kevin Stewart, the first President and CEO of the Carolina Museum of 
the Marine. BGen Stewart, an Iraq and Afghanistan War veteran, has 
served our Nation and his community with great honor and integrity. He 
retired from the Marine Corps in 2021 as the Director of the Global 
Operations Center at U.S. Transportation Command. He also served as the 
Commanding General of the 2nd Marine Logistics Group at Marine Corps 
Base Camp Lejeune, as well as Chief of Staff for the Deputy Commandant 
for Installations and Logistics, at the United States Marine Corps 
headquarters.
  In his two years as CEO, BGen Stewart has demonstrated remarkable 
fundraising and marketing prowess. He secured $4 million from the state 
government, over $1.9 million in private sector donations, and 
additional funds from the city and county governments. He also launched 
the first regional TV and live-streaming ad campaign for the Carolina 
Museum of the Marine. BGen Stewart implemented the organization's first 
brand guidelines and upgraded the website.
  Under his leadership, the Carolina Museum of the Marine is coming to 
life. BGen Stewart is to be commended for assembling a team of 
outstanding design and construction firms and finalizing the necessary 
approvals for the museum. The official groundbreaking earlier this year 
celebrated the start of museum construction, and you can now see the 
walls going up as you drive by the Lejeune Memorial Gardens. To support 
this physical progress, he also strengthened the museum's organization, 
building a top-notch staff, improving fiscal management, and planning 
for its operations.
  This transformational project is becoming so much more than just a 
museum and far surpassing traditional expectations. BGen Stewart led 
development of the Carolina Museum of the Marine's Al Gray Marine 
Leadership Forum that teaches the core values of the Marine Corps, 
strategic thinking, and leadership traits. He oversaw construction of 
the studio for the Leadership Forum and helped to shape the compelling 
programming created there.
  Words do little justice when trying to fully capture the 
contributions BGen Stewart has made to our great Nation and to the 
development of this museum from the ground up. His talent and 
leadership skills are truly second to none. It has been an honor to 
witness his efforts to memorialize the history of our beloved Sailors 
and Marines in the Carolinas. I wish BGen Stewart swift recovery and 
look forward to seeing all that he accomplishes in the future.

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate the exceptional work demonstrated by Shelly McLaren, who 
selflessly dedicates her life to ensuring individuals feel comfort 
following life-altering events across the State of Iowa and the United 
States. This remarkable woman demonstrates an exceptional volunteer 
commitment to serve our communities. As the team lead for the Iowa 
chapter of Crisis Response Canines (CRC), a national nonprofit that 
provides comfort visits and crisis response support following traumatic 
incidents, she has made an indelible mark on Iowa communities and 
beyond.
  Her dedication to rigorous training has earned both her and her 
canine partner, Jacks, the highest certifications. Embracing the credo 
``Purpose Beyond Oneself,'' she is committed to selflessly caring for 
those experiencing life-altering traumatic events.
  She consistently shows an unparalleled ability to mobilize swiftly in 
response to crises, coordinating with operations leaders to support 
those impacted by critical incidents. During these interactions, she 
and Jacks bring their healing, compassionate presence to individuals 
enduring the most traumatic events of their lives. Their deployments 
include responding to the January 4, 2024, shooting in Perry, Iowa; 
assisting in Minden and Greenfield, Iowa, following spring 2024 
tornadoes; and most recently, aiding multiple counties in northwestern 
Iowa after severe storms and flooding.
  When not responding to tragic events, she and Jacks are a well-known 
and respected team, visiting community organizations and attending 
special events.
  Her work has inspired others to join, creating a ripple effect that 
strengthens the community's ability to respond to crises effectively. 
The countless lives touched by her compassion and dedication serve as a 
testament to the lasting impact of her volunteerism.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this 
remarkable woman and Jacks for their service to the State of Iowa and 
the Third Congressional District.

                        REMEMBERING SEAN GRIFFIN

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MARY SATTLER PELTOLA

                               of alaska

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember a very 
special Alaskan.
  On August 25th, a devastating landslide in Ketchikan destroyed homes 
and took a fellow Alaskan from us. That Alaskan was Sean Griffin. Sean 
was a selfless husband, father, son, neighbor, and public servant. 
Ketchikan families knew him for his positive spirit and his devotion to 
his friends, family, and community. At the time of the landslide, Sean, 
a senior maintenance technician for the city, was clearing stormwater 
drains on his day off.
  It's heartbreaking to see that such a model Alaskan and public 
servant is now gone from our Ketchikan community. He will be so deeply 
missed.
  Earlier this month, I witnessed the landslide damage in Ketchikan 
firsthand. It was horrific. Alaskans had their entire lives uprooted.
  Our delegation will be working closely with those affected to make 
sure Ketchikan is safe. But Sean was taken from us too soon. I am 
sharing my deepest condolences to his friends, family and all those 
whose lives he touched. May he rest in peace.

                          ____________________

 HONORING NATALIA SHEVTSOVA'S COMMITMENT TO COMBATING THE OPIOID CRISIS

                                 ______

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Natalia Shevtsova, who 
worked in partnership with her peers to put together a Fight Back 
Against Fentanyl PSA.
  Natalia is from St. Paul, Minnesota. Her sister, Anastasia, loved 
playing the piano, singing, painting and drawing.
  On April 20, 2022, Natalia lost her sister, Anastasia, to fentanyl 
poisoning. She purchased what she thought was Percocet marketed by a 
dealer. Those pills turned out to contain fentanyl.
  Anastasia was 15 years old.
  The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Natalia, produced 
an impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl. In 
turning her grief into activism, Natalia has shown strength and courage 
beyond her years. I am proud to have her as an ally in this fight 
against the fentanyl crisis.
  I thank Natalia for sharing Anastasia's story and demonstrating a 
commitment to combating the opioid crisis.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MR. WALTER HEARNE TO THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE 
                   HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an exemplary 
staff member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Walter 
Hearne, as he retires from Federal Government service this year.
  For twenty-five years, Walter has served the U.S. Congress with 
distinction. He began his career in 1999 as a Staff Assistant with the 
Senate Budget Committee where he developed an affinity for the federal 
budget process. In 2002, he transitioned to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, and the House Committee on Appropriations, where he 
served for several years as professional staff on the Subcommittee on 
Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government and the Subcommittee 
on Transportation and the Treasury.
  In 2004, Walter began working on funding our national security when 
he joined the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans 
Affairs. For seven years, Walter worked to pass annual appropriations 
bills that improved the quality of life for service members and their 
families including improvements in medical care, housing, and child 
development centers. At the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
Walter also worked to pass several supplemental appropriations bills in 
support of ongoing military operations in the U.S. Central Command area 
of responsibility.
  In 2011, Walter brought his national security and appropriations 
experience to the Subcommittee on Defense, where he would work for the 
next fourteen years. On the Subcommittee, Walter primarily served as 
the professional staff member in charge of the Air Force portfolio. He 
worked on programs of tremendous national security importance like the 
modernization of America's nuclear triad, the F-35 Joint Strike 
Fighter, the KC-46 tanker, and Intelligence Community programs. 
Ultimately, Walter would assist in shepherding fifteen appropriations 
bills through Congress while serving as staff on the Subcommittee on 
Defense.
  In the 117th Congress, I was honored to serve as the Chair of the 
Defense Subcommittee during a particularly tumultuous time in America's 
national security. This Congress included the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
end of the War in Afghanistan, and the beginning of Russia's full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine. I was able to be successful as Chair during the 
117th Congress because of the incredible Subcommittee staff serving 
with me, Walter chief among him. As Chair, I knew I could always count 
on Walter's utmost professionalism, deep wealth of knowledge, and his 
best counsel, which he has always provided to Clerks and Chairs of the 
Subcommittee from both parties. His work and was critical to helping me 
enact the Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023 Defense Appropriation 
Acts, and I will always be grateful to him for his work.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in recognizing Walter 
Hearne's achievements over 25 years working in Congress and his record 
of incredible service to our Nation. I wish him all the best in the 
years to come.

  HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIERRA CLUB SAN FRANCISCO BAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BARBARA LEE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th 
anniversary of the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club, and 
their continued dedication to conservation and environmental action and 
advocacy in the Bay Area.
  The Sierra Club was originally founded in 1892, and the San Francisco 
Bay Chapter was established in 1924, including Alameda, San Francisco, 
Contra Costa, Marin, and San Mateo counties.
  Since its founding in 1924, the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the 
Sierra Club has persisted in its mission to advance conservation and 
environmental action in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. 
Throughout their history, the chapter has advocated for the 
preservation of natural landscapes, the protection of wildlife 
habitats, and the promotion of sustainability in public policy. Now in 
2024, the Sierra Club continues its work to be a leader of climate 
action and environmental justice.
  Early accomplishments of the Bay Chapter include supporting the 
creation of Mt. Tamalpais State Park and the East Bay Regional Park 
District, a system of parks and trails throughout Alameda and Contra 
Costa counties. In the decades that followed, the chapter played a key 
role in the creation of landmark legislation such as the Wilderness Act 
of 1964, the Save the Bay movement of the mid-'60s, and the creation of 
McLaughlin Eastshore State Park in Berkeley, California.
  In more recent years, the Bay Chapter has focused on addressing 
pressing environmental challenges such as climate change and urban 
sprawl. Through grassroots organizing, advocacy campaigns, and 
community outreach, the Sierra Club has worked to promote renewable 
energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and advocate for sustainable 
land use policies. The Bay Chapter balances its important campaign 
priorities with a love of the outdoors, encouraging community members 
to experience the outdoors for themselves through one of their vibrant 
activity groups.
  The Bay Chapter's commitment to environmental justice and equitable 
access to nature is a central part of its mission. From tree-planting 
campaigns in Oakland to passing Climate Literacy resolutions in local 
school districts, the Sierra Club aims to create a Bay Area where the 
outdoors and healthy, livable communities are available to all.
  I honor the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club for a 
century of environmental advocacy and critical service to our 
community. Their legacy of leadership and commitment to action will 
inspire positive change in California's 12th Congressional District and 
beyond for years to come. Here's to many more years of inspiring 
dedication to exploring, enjoying, and protecting our environment.

                      Tuesday, September 24, 2024

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the historic 
Friendship Hose Company No. 1 on its 150th Anniversary.
  The Friendship Hose Company No. 1 has provided fire protection dating 
back to the 1830s--with the purchase of a fire engine called ``Juno''--
originating in Newville Pennsylvania. Formally established on January 
14, 1874, the then-Newville Fire Company officially formed and elected 
its first officers. Facing the continuous challenges of staffing and 
funding, the Friendship Hose Company No. 1 endured and prevailed when 
other fire companies fell short.
  Over the past 150 years, the Friendship Hose Company No. 1 has 
operated out of three locations in our community, has had hundreds of 
members, and currently operates with approximately 20-25 active 
volunteers. Under the current leadership of President Trent Wagner and 
Fire Chief David Bobb, the Company continues to serve our community 
through tireless service and heroic work in fire protection.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and privileged to recognize the Friendship 
Hose Company No. 1 on their 150th Anniversary. Their selfless and 
tireless service to the community, Commonwealth, and Nation is the 
standard by which we should all be judged. I wish them Godspeed in 
their continued endeavors and pray for their safety and security for 
years to come.

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Natalia 
Rustand, who

[[Page E965]]

worked in partnership with her peers to put together a Fight Back 
Against Fentanyl PSA.
  Natalia is from St. Paul Park, Minnesota. She has proven her 
commitment to combating the opioid crisis through her advocacy and work 
with the Devin Norring Foundation. The Devin Norring Foundation was 
established to honor Devin's legacy and raise awareness about the 
dangers of illicit drugs and fentanyl.
  On April 4, 2020, Devin passed away from fentanyl poisoning. He was 
seeking relief from blackout migraines and dental pain. He bought what 
he thought was Percocet marketed by a drug dealer on Snapchat. That 
pill turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl.
  Devin was 19 years old.
  The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Natalia, produced 
an impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl. In 
turning grief into activism, Natalia has shown strength and courage 
beyond her years. I am proud to have her as a constituent and an ally 
in this fight against the fentanyl crisis.
  I thank Natalia for demonstrating a commitment to combating the 
opioid crisis.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional 
District, I would like to recognize the mayor of Glendale, Arizona, 
Jerry Weiers.
  Originally born in South Dakota, Mayor Weiers moved to Phoenix as a 
child where he went on to serve in the Arizona House of Representatives 
before becoming mayor of Glendale in 2012. Outside of public service, 
Mayor Weiers was also a proud small-business owner and family man.
  During his time in both the state legislature and as mayor of 
Glendale, Mayor Weiers has been a strong advocate for the military and 
veterans, reduced bureaucratic red tape, and created conditions for 
small businesses to thrive. As mayor, he has created a thriving 
business-sector through public-private partnerships, increased public 
safety, worked toward reducing homelessness, and been a strong advocate 
for Luke Air Force Base and Glendale's veterans.
  His successes in public service have left a lasting impact on both 
the Glendale community and the state of Arizona as a whole. I thank him 
for his service.

  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, Colorado native Jennifer Jaime is a testament 
and great example of the hardworking students Colorado has to offer. 
She is a first-generation student from metro Denver, and enrolled in CU 
Denver in 2017, and participated in the Marc U-Star Program--a 
scholarship program for students interested research careers and plan 
in pursuing their Ph.D's in behavioral and biomedical sciences. Through 
the MARC U-program Jennifer participated in a summer research program 
at Princeton University.
  She graduated in 2019 with a BA in psychology and was admitted to the 
University of Michigan's competitive Neuroscience Graduate Program for 
her doctorate. Jaime received her PhD in May 2024 and has chosen to 
return to Colorado for her post graduate work at CU Anschutz where she 
started her post-doctoral fellowship in August 2024.
  It is my distinct privilege as the United States Representative of 
the 4th District of Colorado to congratulate Jennifer for her hard work 
in achieving this accomplishment and I'm so glad she chose to return 
home to Colorado. Welcome home to Jennifer, and I thank her for her 
example and the research she is doing.

               SHOOTING IN BIRMINGHAM'S FIVE POINTS SOUTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to 
honor the victims of the horrific mass shooting that rattled the 
Birmingham community over the weekend.
  On Saturday night, just after 11 p.m., 21 people were shot in 
Birmingham's Five Points South entertainment district. Four of them 
tragically lost their lives.
  Let me be clear: this, indeed, is a senseless violence and 
unacceptable, and it must stop. Our thoughts are with the families as 
they endure this unimaginable loss. Nothing compares to the pain of 
losing a loved one to gun violence. We stand with them in this time of 
great sadness, and we pray for a speedy recovery for those who were 
injured.
  I join in expressing my gratitude to the police officers and first 
responders, as well as our county, State, and Federal partners, for 
their quick response.
  My staff and I have been closely monitoring the situation, and we 
stand ready to assist the city of Birmingham in any way that we can.
  While this horrific tragedy has focused the eyes of the Nation on 
Birmingham, Alabama, the surge of gun violence is a reality that far 
too many of my constituents endure every day.
  Our communities are crying out for change, and we, as elected 
officials, owe it to them to do all that we can at every level of 
government to keep them safe.
  Again, I want to be clear: this senseless violence is unacceptable, 
and it must stop. That means bringing more resources to community 
organizations that are fighting to break the cycle of violence. It 
means teaching our children about alternatives to gun violence, and it 
also means passing commonsense measures to keep weapons off of the 
streets of America.
  Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are important. They are needed, 
but they will not bring back the lives of those lost to gun violence, 
nor will they prevent such tragedies from happening again.
  The Members of this body cannot continue to sit by as family after 
family, community after community, are torn apart. It is time for 
Congress to finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, 
and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
  It is also time for State officials in the State of Alabama to 
reverse the permitless carry law, which has allowed the unchecked 
proliferation of guns onto our streets. Only by taking meaningful 
action can we stem this needless loss of life.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to keep the entire Birmingham 
community in their prayers, and I hope that we can come together and 
turn this pain into purpose and do something about it.

                       RETURN TO TRUE CAPITALISM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the final frontier of the woke mind virus is 
the banks and capitalism themselves. They have already tarnished 
America's other institutions.
  Last week, House Republicans passed H.R. 5339, the Protecting 
Americans' Investments from Woke Policies Act, a bill that would 
confront and dispatch one of the most nefarious and hidden forms of 
wokeness: environmental, social, and governance investing, or ESG for 
short.
  In his book, ``Go Woke, Go Broke,'' author Charles Gasparino 
punctures the woke mind virus and ESG.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the book review of ``Go Woke, Go 
Broke.''

             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 2024]

           `Go Woke, Go Broke' Review: The Worst Investments

                         (By Tunku Varadarajan)

       Charles Gasparino is a gladiatorial journalist. When he 
     steps into the arena to fight a money-man or enterprise that 
     he believes is anticapitalist or crooked, he can be brutal. 
     Making an enemy of him is not for the faint-hearted: Watch 
     him trade insults with his critics on social media. He was 
     once a Wall Street reporter for this newspaper, where

[[Page H5652]]

     editors and colleagues remember him for his no-holds-barred 
     style. Which is precisely how we'd describe the approach in 
     ``Go Woke, Go Broke,'' Mr. Gasparino's blistering account of 
     ``how corporate America became something close to a foot 
     soldier in the progressive movement.'' Now a senior 
     correspondent at the Fox Business Network, Mr. Gasparino is 
     also a columnist at the New York Post, whose irreverent, 
     indignant (and often irresistible) tabloid style is very much 
     in evidence here. (Fox, the Post and the Journal share common 
     ownership.)
       ``Go Woke, Go Broke'' is a takedown of ``corporate 
     wokeness,'' which Mr. Gasparino describes as the ``noxious 
     ideology of progressive politics in the boardroom--an 
     ideology, he says, that ``needs to die a thousand deaths.'' 
     The book can be seen as a demotic complement to ``Woke, 
     Inc.'' (2021), by the brainy (and sometimes tiresome) former 
     Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy. Mr. 
     Gasparino's is the better book for its plainspokenness: Many 
     more Middle Americans--whose jobs have been outsourced or 
     have been imperiled by the high-minded dictates of 
     ``diversity''--will grasp its message. These are the people 
     who, Mr. Gasparino argues, have been shafted by the Wall 
     Street ``fat cats'' who've grown ``much fatter'' by their 
     ``feeding at the ESG trough.''
       ESG stands for ``environmental, social, and governance''--
     metrics intended to direct or funnel investment in an 
     ostensibly socially responsible direction. Mr. Gasparino is a 
     populist-capitalist, and ESG is his bete noire, along with 
     ``diversity, equity, and inclusion'' (DEI). These ``leftist 
     shibboleths'' have, the author says, ``warped'' American 
     business practices for nearly two decades and grew in 
     intensity under the second Obama administration.
       Mr. Gasparino traces the roots of ESG to the 1980s and 
     '90s, when business leaders began embracing so-called 
     corporate social responsibility (or CSR, in its now archaic 
     abbreviation). CSR, in time, evolved into bien-pensant 
     notions of stakeholder capitalism, championed by the likes of 
     Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum in 
     Davos, Switzerland. Davos Man, writes Mr. Gasparino, 
     ``represents the ultimate marriage of the progressive 
     globalist corporate citizen with the globalist progressive 
     regulatory bureaucrat.''
       All this performatively moral investing is a revolt against 
     Milton Friedman, the economist who in 1970 stated that ``the 
     social responsibility of business is to increase its 
     profits.'' Friedman, writes Mr. Gasparino, would have hated 
     ESG and DEI, ``among the most heinously anti-American 
     management philosophies ever developed.'' (Readers of Mr. 
     Gasparino's robust book will realize pretty quickly that 
     nuance is for wimps.)
       Basing his book largely on a host of interviews with 
     ``company insiders,'' Mr. Gasparino gives us entertaining 
     (and informative) accounts of corporate blunders in the name 
     of wokeness. He reminds us of the time AB InBev--the holding 
     company for Anheuser-Busch and its beer, Budweiser--thought 
     it would be a great idea to use a ``transwoman influencer'' 
     named Dylan Mulvaney to market its top-selling Bud Light. 
     Middle America revolted and stopped buying the beer, 
     heretofore branded as a manly beverage. Mr. Gasparino also 
     recounts how the discount retailer Target was punished by 
     consumers for promoting ``tuck-friendly bathing suits for men 
     transitioning to women'' alongside rainbow-colored onesies 
     for toddlers. And Disney, recalls the author, erred 
     politically and financially when its chief executive, Bob 
     Chapek, embarked on a bruising battle with Florida's Gov. Ron 
     DeSantis and challenged the validity of a state law barring 
     public schools from teaching sexual education to children 
     before the fourth grade. In each case, the company's stock 
     price tanked and sales plummeted.
       It enrages Mr. Gasparino that America's corporate 
     management luxuriates ``in progressive causes as a side 
     hustle.'' But in some cases, he tells us, these causes are 
     the main course. Among the villains trying to ram ESG down 
     our throats are Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock; Jamie 
     Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase; David Solomon, the CEO of 
     Goldman Sachs; and the ``ESG-obsessed'' Gary Gensler, 
     President Biden's chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
     Commission, whom Mr. Gasparino describes as ``a male 
     version'' of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ``among the most woke, 
     annoying, and . . . dangerous bureaucrats in government.'' 
     Add to the list Adena Friedman, the CEO of Nasdaq, which 
     demands that companies seeking to list on its exchange 
     disclose board-level diversity statistics and, if the need 
     arises, explain why they don't have a diversity of directors. 
     Such demands aren't, of course, slapped on Chinese companies, 
     which are, Mr. Gasparino points out, curiously exempt from 
     all the wokest rules. When was the last time a Chinese 
     company was asked why it didn't have a Uyghur on its board, 
     or an LGBTQ+ person?
       Attacking Larry Fink as ``Mr. ESG,'' says Mr. Gasparino, 
     has become ``a rallying cry on the populist right,'' whose 
     backlash against corporate wokeness has been so fierce that 
     even BlackRock has started to dismount from its moral high 
     horse. Consumers' Research, a conservative advocacy group 
     pushing back against ESG, derides the abbreviation as 
     ``elitists, socialists, and grifters,'' as well as ``erasing 
     savings and growth''--pungent and effective put-downs. More 
     and more investors are aware that ESG-specific funds are 
     expensive and rarely beat the market. In fact, writes Mr. 
     Gasparino, ``they're some of the worst investments,'' even as 
     they make it harder to tackle inflation by forcing curbs on 
     fossil fuels. But Middle America appears to have woken up to 
     the perils of ESG and is giving voice to its displeasure. 
     ``It's now their Arab Spring,'' says Mr. Gasparino. This may 
     be hyperbolic overreach, even for the crusading Mr. 
     Gasparino, but he's confident that America's version of a 
     grassroots people's revolt will end better than the one in 
     the Middle East. Let's pray he's right.

  Ms. FOXX. He describes ESG, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, 
DEI, as `` . . . among the most heinously anti-American management 
philosophies ever developed.''
  This book amplifies the points we made when we passed our legislation 
last week. ESG is an ideological cancer buoyed by asset managers, 
banks, and financial institutions that kneel at the altar of 
anticapitalism.
  Americans saving for retirement don't want to see their hard-earned 
money go up in flames in ESG funds. They want a sizeable return on 
their investments.
  We need to embrace true capitalism again in America. This woke 
garbage needs to be put out to pasture and left to die.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF GLEN NEFF McGHIE, JR.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to eulogize three individuals who made 
a difference in their lives, in so many different ways, to our 
community and to our country.
  Glen Neff McGhie, Jr., was one of those whose life made a difference. 
He exemplified service to our community and to our country.
  He served in Vietnam. After coming home, he continued to dedicate 
much of his life to helping veterans in need, who needed support after 
serving our country, as well as those who had suffered disabilities.
  He was a devout volunteer to the Disabled American Veterans 
organization and served as president of the Veterans Home of 
California, a home that I have worked with for many, many years that we 
brought together with State and Federal funding.
  Glen was very proud of the ability to provide services to our 
veterans throughout the San Joaquin Valley. One of his last major 
accomplishments was building a monument, which is seen here, to honor 
veterans in the San Joaquin Valley whose lives exemplified public 
service. For a grateful Nation, we can never ever be thankful enough, 
and Glen understood that.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the memory of Glen Neff 
McGhie. He will be remembered for so many of the invaluable 
contributions he has made, not only to our community, but to our 
valley, to our State, and to our Nation.


                   Honoring the Life of Kathy Bonilla

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to honor the life of Kathy 
Bonilla. Kathy was a stellar educator who represented Fresno City 
College and the State Center Community College System, again, in the 
San Joaquin Valley.
  She understood the importance of the community college system in 
California, which encompassed 116 community colleges. State Center was 
where she did so much for so many who have received their community 
college education.
  Since 1991, she served as a public information officer for Fresno 
City College, home of the Rams, ensuring that the community learned 
about the college's exemplary programs and outstanding students, who 
were all using this opportunity to further their education so that they 
could have opportunities for career paths that would add value and make 
a difference for our country.
  Her extensive contributions established her as an expert in media, 
and her work extended to the State level as an active member of the 
California Community College Public Relations Organization because it 
was important to talk about all the incredible things that Fresno City 
College did and the opportunities that they provided for students 
throughout our valley.
  Above all, Kathy was a wonderful mother and wife to her husband, 
Jesse, and their daughter, Angelina.

[[Page H5653]]

  She is missed. Her humor will remain a reminder of the joy she has 
filled countless lives with. We mourn the loss of this esteemed member 
of our community.
  Dr. Carole Goldsmith knows that she made a difference. The people in 
Fresno know that she made a difference, and we will miss her.


             Honoring the Life of Dorothy ``Dottie'' Jones

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to honor the life of Dottie 
Jones, and what an incredible life it was. She lived 103 years, and she 
lived with passion and determination.
  A loving mother of four children and a lifelong friend, she 
peacefully passed away at 103 years of age.
  When Dottie was 21 years of age, she saw the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
A year later, in 1942, she enlisted in the United States Navy to serve 
our country.
  She was among the first of women to join the United States Navy and 
served during World War II with distinction and honor, where only 
350,000 females served in the United States military during World War 
II.
  She was a groundbreaker in so many different ways, breaking the glass 
ceiling, knowing that women could do these jobs and serve their country 
with distinction and honor and make a difference, and what a difference 
she made.
  Throughout her life, she contributed to our community in so many 
different ways. The legacy of her strength, her love, and resilience 
will live in the hearts of her family and all of those who knew her and 
had the privilege of being a part of her life.
  Ms. Jones, my friend, will be deeply missed, and I thank her for a 
job well done.

                   GOLD STAR FAMILY REMEMBRANCE WEEK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize this 
week as Gold Star Family Remembrance Week.
  Every September, Gold Star Family Remembrance Week takes place the 
week before Gold Star Mother's Day, which has been observed by 
Presidential proclamations on the last Sunday of September since 1936.
  The Gold Star symbol, a significant reminder of sacrifice, originated 
in 1917, when United States began its involvement in World War I.
  Families would hang banners to represent a family member in the armed 
services. If the family member passed in combat, the family would 
change the banner from a blue star to a gold star, a symbol of the 
highest honor and most profound loss.
  We will never know the exact number of Gold Star families. However, 
according to the National Gold Star Family Registry, at least 472,251 
fallen military members are registered by loved ones. At least 36,584 
of those servicemembers have been registered in my home State of 
Pennsylvania.
  As an Army dad, I am blessed that my son returned home. I am aware 
that this is not the case for all families, and we must take the time 
to remember, respect, and honor the families of our fallen 
servicemembers.
  I look forward to supporting efforts, such as Gold Star Family 
Remembrance Week, to honor and remember our fallen servicemembers and 
their families. This week recognizes the loss and sacrifices of 
families in support of fallen members of the Armed Forces, as well as 
veterans.
  I look forward to supporting legislative efforts to honor this 
occasion and encourage my fellow Americans to perform acts of community 
service and goodwill to honor those families.
  Our servicemembers are the bravest among us. They answer the call to 
protect and defend our country in times of war and in times of peace.
  This important week is a time to remember the families of the brave 
men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our 
freedom.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all take a moment to remember that our freedom is 
not free.
  We cannot begin to imagine the loss and the pain these families have 
experienced. Gold Star families have lost a loved one in the name of 
protecting our freedom, and they deserve our gratitude every day.

        CONGRATULATING JORDAN CHILES ON GOLD MEDAL IN GYMNASTICS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. Perez) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. PEREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jordan Chiles, a 
Gold Medal Olympic gymnast representing Team USA on her incredible 
performance in Paris.
  Chiles grew up in Vancouver and attended Prairie High School. She was 
raised by parents who were both pastors, a unique identity I proudly 
relate to.
  By the time Jordan had graduated high school, she had already made a 
national name for herself. At only 12, she made the U.S. gymnastics 
national team, a truly remarkable feat for any age.
  Jordan's incredible journey as an athlete, where she navigates the 
pressure of being watched by millions, is nothing short of inspiring.
  Mr. Speaker, Jordan Chiles has made her community in southwest 
Washington and her country very proud.


              Recognizing Vancouver Police Chief Jeff Mori

  Ms. PEREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Police Chief Jeff 
Mori of the Vancouver Police Department and congratulate him on his 
upcoming retirement.
  Chief Mori has served the Vancouver Police Department for 5 years and 
spent over 31 years working in law enforcement.
  While serving as chief, Chief Mori oversaw the rollout of the VPD 
camera program, the recruitment and hiring of over 75 officers and 
staff, and advocated for a southwest Washington regional Criminal 
Justice Training Academy, which is now successfully training new 
recruits.
  The Vancouver Police Department is our first line of defense to keep 
our communities safe, and it is a responsibility I know they don't take 
lightly.
  Although we are losing a valued member of the team, I know his impact 
will remain.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Mori for all that he has done for our 
community. I am honored to have gotten to know him and for the chance 
to work with him, and I hope that retirement treats him well.


          SkillsUSA's National Leadership & Skills Conference

  Ms. PEREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the six high school 
students from my district who placed in the top three for their 
category at SkillsUSA's National Leadership & Skills Conference this 
past June.
  The SkillsUSA competition highlights skilled trades and the 
accomplishments of career-ready leaders in a nationwide, weeklong 
event.
  Sebastian Nejar and Luke Twiss from Evergreen High School in 
Vancouver won a silver medal in the category of interactive application 
and video game development.
  Zachariah Hubbard and Kaiden Wood from Rochester High School won a 
silver medal in the category of commercial sUAS drone.
  Daniel Dugas and Mason Young from Rochester High School also won a 
silver medal in the category of robotics--urban search and rescue.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate each team for such a great 
accomplishment. They all have made us very proud in southwest 
Washington.


                 Recognizing Retirement of Bill Draper

  Ms. PEREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of 
Bill Draper, who has been a construction technology instructor at 
Cascadia Tech for 28 years.
  Cascadia Tech Academy is a premier career and technical education 
institution that was created in partnership with 10 school districts in 
my community. Cascadia Tech provides hands-on learning opportunities 
for students so they can develop talents and gain credentials that will 
make them ready to hit the ground running after graduation.
  After 11 years in the construction field, Bill became a steward of 
the next generation of doers and makers. I have seen firsthand the 
incredible respect his students have for him and the pride

[[Page H5654]]

he cultivates in them for the trades, which is why he so deservingly 
earned the Evergreen School District's Educator of the Year award in 
2021.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Bill for all he has done for our community and 
our students. I wish him the very best in his last year in the 
classroom and in his well-deserved retirement.


     MIA Air Force Sergeant David Stanley Price Finally Comes Home

  Ms. PEREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the return home to 
Centralia for Air Force Sergeant David Stanley Price, who has been 
considered missing in action for the last 56 years.
  On March 11, 1968, while serving in the Vietnam war, Sergeant Price 
was declared missing in action when the outpost he was manning was 
attacked.
  On that day, he, along with 10 other servicemembers manning that 
post, were deemed to be killed or captured.
  Finally, last year, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency recovered 
his remains and was able to identify Sergeant Price. This allowed for 
him to finally return home and end the decades of worry and wondering 
his family has gone through.
  Sergeant Price was a husband and father and an active member of his 
community. I cannot imagine the pain his loved ones have had to endure 
over the last 56 years, but I hope the return of his remains brings 
them some measure of peace.
  Sergeant Price made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, and I am 
grateful that he can be properly laid to rest at home.

      HONORING HEROES WHO MADE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IN OCTOBER 1983

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Pence) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 241 American heroes 
who made the ultimate sacrifice on October 23, 1983, 41 years ago, in 
Beirut, Lebanon.
  For my family and so many families, this day is deeply emotional.
  When I enlisted in 1979 as a young man, I wanted to serve and be part 
of something bigger. That led me to the United States Marine Corps.
  Like every marine, I took an oath to God, to country, and to the 
corps. Semper Fidelis is not just a slogan or creed. For every marine, 
it is a way of life.
  Only those who have earned the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor can fully 
understand the faith and loyalty instilled in us in the Marine Corps. 
Semper Fidelis is part of the very fabric of every marine, past and 
present.
  I served as the first lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. 
In 1983, my battalion was ordered to Beirut, Lebanon, in support of the 
1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment and the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit.
  I vividly remember the evenings we sat on the roof of the Marine 
barracks with the American flag flying over our heads. The nearby 
barrage of small armed gunfire and mortar rounds made it very clear 
that we were in harm's way.
  On that terrible day 41 years ago, a terrorist affiliated with 
Hezbollah and Hamas, financed by Iran, drove a truck bomb into the 
barracks we called home.
  Mr. Speaker, 241 American servicemen were killed, 220 of which were 
my fellow marines, 241 sons, brothers, fathers, and friends, the heroes 
who never returned home.
  Mr. Speaker, 241 came in peace, and 241 lives were stolen from us by 
an act of pure evil.
  It was the deadliest day for the Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo 
Jima.
  It is by the grace of God that I was able to come home to my wife, 
Denise, who was expecting our first child, Nicole. My battalion had 
shipped out 10 days before the bombing, but, Mr. Speaker, today is not 
about me.
  Today is about the 241 soldiers, sailors, and marines who laid down 
their lives to protect our freedoms. Today is about every veteran who 
nobly wore the uniform of our Armed Forces.
  On this somber day, I look out at the flag flying over the U.S. 
Capitol and feel the same reverence I felt standing below the Stars and 
Stripes on the roof of the Beirut barracks in 1983.
  Though I will never know exactly why I was spared when so many were 
not, I understand that our first duty is to remember and be faithful. 
Every year, it does not get any easier to think of my fellow marines 
who never made it back home.
  In the last few months, we have seen some level of justice, with the 
military termination of two of those responsible for stealing 241 
futures with no regard for decency or humanity. While this is a moment 
I and so many have waited for, the families of the fallen deserve more. 
It is my mission to ensure we all remember the tragedy of this day and 
the lives we lost.
  Mr. Speaker, we must always remain faithful and never forget the 
ultimate sacrifice these fine marines made on our behalf for freedom.
  Semper Fi.

                     SOUNDING ALARM ON PROJECT 2025

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm about the 
dangerous and extreme policies put forward in Project 2025, the self-
described blueprint for the Republican President to take over total 
control of the Federal Government and our lives.
  Spanning more than 900 pages, Project 2025 lays out not a concept of 
a plan but a plan for Donald Trump or another GOP President to ignore 
the Constitution and unilaterally turn back the clock on working 
families, women, and our children.
  For families, Project 2025 calls to eliminate overtime pay and kick 
people with preexisting conditions off of their healthcare insurance.
  For women and girls, Project 2025 calls for taking the Republican 
abortion bans that are devastating women in Georgia and Texas and 
jeopardizing IVF in Alabama and doing the same nationally.
  For our children, Project 2025 calls for eliminating the Department 
of Education and defunding our public schools.
  Each and every one of these proposals would have been devastating for 
millions of Americans. I know that, Mr. Speaker, because every one of 
them would have ruined my life.
  My dad was a union ironworker. He picked up overtime whenever 
possible so that he could keep a roof over our heads and put food on 
the table. Like so many families, Project 2025 taking away the chance 
to work overtime could have meant us losing our home or going to bed 
hungry.
  When my dad was diagnosed with MS at just 48 years old, he needed his 
health insurance to visit the doctor and afford his medications. 
Project 2025 allowing an insurance corporation to kick him off his 
healthcare coverage just because he was sick would have been a death 
sentence, just as it could be for millions of Americans with 
preexisting conditions.
  When my husband and I decided to start our family but struggled to 
get pregnant, we were forced to turn to IVF, and we are so fortunate to 
have our two beautiful daughters, but as we saw in Alabama, Project 
2025's proposals that endanger IVF fertility treatments can be 
physically and mentally debilitating for couples turning to fertility 
treatments as their last hope.
  Finally, I am the proud product of Lowell Public Schools, from 
elementary to high school. Like any public school student, I can tell 
you so many stories of teachers who made the most of the little 
resources they had to give us every opportunity to succeed.
  Ripping that lifeline away from working families, as Project 2025 
proposes, is a horrible idea, plain and simple.
  Project 2025 will take us backward to a time when life was great if 
you were wealthy or well connected, but that same time was hard. It was 
hard for workers and parents like mine who wanted nothing more than to 
give their kids a better life than they had. That is why I am here to 
say that we can't and we won't go back.
  House Democrats will move our country forward with a vision where 
people are proud to be an American again.
  They are proud because working families aren't just getting by and 
making ends meet, but they are getting ahead.

[[Page H5655]]

  They are proud because women have the freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions without the fear of politicians getting in the 
way.
  Lastly, they are proud because our children can go to class and 
thrive while us moms and dads don't have to worry about their school 
being defunded or, worse, the next target of a deranged mass shooter.
  Mr. Speaker, that should be something all of us can get behind, and 
it is why I will urge my Republican colleagues to reject Project 2025 
and work with us to build a future where people have every chance to 
get ahead.

           RECOGNIZING BANK OF BOTETOURT'S 125TH ANNIVERSARY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Cline) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a cornerstone of our 
community, the Bank of Botetourt, as they celebrate 125 years of 
dedicated service.
  Founded as the Bank of Buchanan in 1899 and chartered by the general 
assembly, the institution began its journey on Main Street in Buchanan. 
In 1995, they changed their name to the Bank of Botetourt.
  Today, they have grown into a vital part of our local economy, 
boasting $800 million in assets and employing 133 individuals across 13 
locations.
  Covering 2,500 square miles, they positively impact the lives of 
residents throughout Botetourt, Franklin, Roanoke, and Rockbridge 
Counties, as well as the city of Salem. Most recently, they have 
expanded their reach by establishing new offices in Rocky Mount and 
Goodwill's Melrose Plaza in Roanoke.
  Throughout its remarkable 125-year history, the bank has been guided 
by seven dedicated presidents and remains one of only six Virginia 
State-chartered banks to have existed before the establishment of the 
State Corporation Commission.
  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, congratulate the Bank of Botetourt for 
125 years of outstanding, efficient, and courteous service to our 
citizens. May their success continue for many more years to come.

       Recognizing Muhlenberg Lutheran Church's 175th Anniversary

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an incredible milestone 
for Muhlenberg Lutheran Church in Virginia's Sixth District as they 
celebrate their 175th anniversary this year.
  Muhlenberg has come far from their humble beginnings in 1849 in 
downtown Harrisonburg. The first worship space was a small, wooden 
structure on the corner of Wolfe and Main, and the congregation boasted 
50 baptized members.
  The church grew in size and spirit, and after one century, Muhlenberg 
broke ground on its current location along East Market Street.
  The new soaring spire was topped with a unique ``Gospel cross'' 
containing four outward-pointing arrows. The cross is a perfect 
representation of the church's identity as members go forth in all 
directions to live out Christ's love.
  Muhlenberg's values can be seen in their work to establish People 
Helping People and Second Home to sponsor refugee families and to 
support numerous local nonprofits and global missions.
  Muhlenberg celebrated their anniversary with a homecoming banquet 
complete with live music, catered lunch, the unveiling of their 
signature quilt, and a special program recounting memories of the many 
saints who have gone before them.
  As they mark 175 faithful years, they look forward to many more, 
inviting all to gather at the wellspring of God's grace.


                    Honoring Gold Star Mother's Day

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, this week, we honor Gold Star Mothers and the 
families of our fallen servicemembers.
  Gold Star Mother's Day, observed on the last Sunday of September, is 
a tribute to the valor of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to our Nation and the immense pain their families endure.
  The Gold Star symbol originated during World War I when families 
displayed blue stars for their loved ones in the military.
  When a servicemember was lost, families would replace the blue star 
with a gold star, a poignant representation of the profound loss 
experienced by these families. It is a symbol of love, loss, and 
sacrifice.
  While we may never know the exact number of Gold Star families, the 
national Gold Star Family Registry reports at least 472,259 fallen 
military members are honored by loved ones. In Virginia alone, at least 
9,640 servicemembers have been recognized.
  Today and every day, we remember the bravery of our fallen heroes and 
acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice made by their mothers, fathers, 
siblings, and loved ones.
  Their families endured unimaginable pain, yet they show incredible 
resilience and strength. Their sacrifice shapes their lives and reminds 
us of the true cost of freedom.
  As we honor Gold Star Mothers, we extend our deepest gratitude to all 
military families. They are the backbone of our Armed Forces, 
supporting their loved ones through deployments and navigating 
uncertainty with resilience.
  As a Nation, we are forever grateful for the sacrifices made by our 
servicemembers and their families. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to 
provide support and resources to help Gold Star families heal and honor 
the memories of their loved ones.


                        Recognizing Terri Tulley

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable individual 
from Virginia's Sixth District, Ms. Terri Tulley.
  Tulley served in the United States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2003 and 
broke her leg while stationed in Japan in 2001. Due to complications, 
her leg was amputated in 2020.
  Tulley went on to train for the National Veterans Wheelchair Games in 
a variety of sports, including swimming, adaptive fitness, softball, 
pickleball, air rifle, and cornhole.
  Tulley was one of 13 people chosen to compete in New Orleans in July 
on a team sent by the Veterans Affairs facility in Martinsburg, West 
Virginia.
  She competed in 7 events and left with 1 gold medal and 2 silver 
medals in swimming and adaptive fitness. She also placed in the top 8 
for pickleball and the top 10 for air rifle.
  Her remarkable athletic accomplishments and commitment to overcoming 
adversity are testaments to her exceptional character. Her achievements 
as an athlete, veteran, wife, and mother deserve commendation.
  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate this achievement, we congratulate Terri 
Tulley on her remarkable feats and thank her for her service. On behalf 
of Virginia's Sixth District, I extend our deepest gratitude and best 
wishes.


                        Honoring Leonard Kraemer

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, today I honor a special person from 
Virginia's Sixth District, Mr. Leonard Kraemer, for his amazing service 
to our country.

                     WORKING IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Slotkin) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to answer a question that I 
was asked actually on the plane ride here yesterday from Michigan.
  I was sitting next to a woman. She recognized me. She was from a 
different political affiliation. She said: It just looks like such a 
mess in Washington. Is anything getting done?
  I will highlight some of the things that we actually did get done 
this week, just in the past week, because of bipartisan cooperation.
  It doesn't make headlines, it is not sexy, but I think it is 
important to understand that the country wants us to work together, and 
when we do, we pass things that are important.
  This week, we passed important bipartisan priorities and legislation. 
We worked hard to get them across the finish line.
  Here is an example. We passed the Customs Trade Partnership Against 
Terrorism Pilot Program Act. It is a lot of words, but it is a 
bipartisan bill I introduced in December of 2023. It is basically TSA 
PreCheck for freight coming across our borders. This bill will cut a 
lot of red tape for companies transporting goods across our borders.
  In Michigan, we are a northern border State. It will help keep our 
country

[[Page H5656]]

safe by creating this pilot program that allows us to move more freight 
and allow freight and warehouse companies to participate in Customs and 
Border Protection's CTPAT program. It is a public-private partnership 
that basically allows you to get preclearance to move freight and store 
freight that has been precleared.
  I introduced this bill because Michigan is a border State. Every 
single day we have 40,000 commuters, tourists, and truck drivers coming 
across our border.
  Mr. Speaker, $323 million worth of goods every single day is coming 
across our borders, one of the busiest land borders in the country.
  I introduced this bill specifically because of freight companies and 
businesses like Frontline Logistics, which is a small, 15-person 
business in Brighton, Michigan. They reached out and they said: Hey, we 
want to expand this TSA PreCheck program so we can grow our business 
and other small businesses can grow.
  The bill will become law because it was bipartisan, and I am grateful 
to the group of bipartisan Members in the House who sponsored this bill 
and helped get it passed not just in the House but in the Senate, and 
it is on its way to be signed at the White House.
  Here is another example from yesterday. There was not a lot of press 
on this. We passed the IMPACTT Human Trafficking Act, which is designed 
to give survivors of human trafficking and law enforcement officers who 
fight this crime the tools and the resources they need.
  Michigan is number eight in the country for human trafficking. Again, 
our border plays a role in this. It is an issue that is close to many 
people's hearts. We have had young women, in particular, taken from 
their homes and moved across State lines.
  Again, this bill will become law because it was bipartisan, and I was 
proud to introduce it with Representative Joyce as well as 
Representatives Wagner and Titus. That bipartisan support got it over 
the finish line in the House and in the Senate.
  Similarly, just yesterday, the House passed the Senate version of the 
Building Chips in America Act, a bipartisan bill that Congresswoman 
Kiggans introduced here in the House and on which I am a proud 
cosponsor.
  It will streamline the process so that we can build more microchips 
in the United States, manufacture more microchips in the United States. 
We invented those microchips. We make zero percent of the microchips 
that go in cars. That is a problem. We were able to pass this yesterday 
because it was bipartisan, and it passed unanimously in the Senate.
  These bills are evidence that we do not need to be at each other's 
throats. In fact, being at each other's throats is principally against 
the mission of what it means to be a Representative.
  It means you are not getting work done. It means you are doing things 
for political posturing. It means that you care more about making a 
statement that makes the news or goes viral on Twitter than you do 
about actually moving the ball down the field for your constituents.
  I hope that when Congress returns in November and when a new Congress 
is sworn in next year, we can learn that basic lesson. We do our best 
work when we work together, even when it is hard.
  We could do things that support the Commerce Department. Yesterday, 
they put in a big countermeasure to make sure that Chinese-connected 
vehicles aren't moving around in the United States. Congress should 
pass legislation that strengthens that.
  We could pass the farm bill, which should be bipartisan, a big piece 
of legislation every 5 years.
  The National Defense Authorization Act, funding our military, funding 
our military salaries, big appropriations bills that go to the 
essential function of government, all of that is work on our plate 
after the election.
  I sincerely hope that we are able to act like adults and do the 
things that most people want us to do, which is get in a room, hash 
things out, hammer it out, compromise, and move the ball forward for 
the American people. I urge my colleagues to remember this. It is much 
easier to get things done when we work together.

                          ____________________

                             HOUSING ISSUES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Flood) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss Vice President Kamala 
Harris' housing plan.
  First, let's talk about the broader problem. Housing is less 
affordable and less available today, and it is bringing costs onto the 
American people.
  Overall, housing underproduction costs the U.S. economy $1.6 trillion 
in lost wages and productivity every single year.
  The U.S. needs to build 4.3 million more apartments by 2035 to meet 
the demand for rental housing. This includes 600,000 units to fill the 
shortage from after the 2008 financial crisis.
  Underproduction of housing has translated to higher housing costs, 
resulting in a decline of 4.7 million affordable apartments from 2015 
to 2020.
  Housing underproduction also increases the cost of living for 
families, inhibits geographic mobility, burdens both renters and 
buyers, and stifles economic productivity.
  According to one estimate, from 1964 to 2009, our national housing 
shortage lowered aggregate economic growth by 36 percent.
  All of that is to say there is no question we have a housing supply 
problem in this country. Unfortunately, Vice President Kamala Harris' 
plans would make the problem much, much worse.
  The Harris plan's goals are to ``lower housing costs for working 
families and end America's housing shortage.'' The problem is that the 
Biden-Harris policies and the Harris plan will actually raise housing 
costs and worsen the housing crisis.
  I will break it down piece by piece to demonstrate why. First, let's 
start with Kamala Harris' proposal to add tens of thousands of dollars 
in new downpayment assistance for home buyers.
  Large amounts of downpayment assistance might sound nice, it might 
sound like it is free, but it is exactly the wrong answer in this 
environment with housing shortages across the country.
  More government subsidies won't bring housing costs down. They will 
continue to increase demand and drive prices even higher.
  The great irony is that this policy would hurt the very people it is 
intended to help. Think about a young person who is currently renting 
but planning to buy a home. He and his wife may be looking at prices on 
Zillow and diligently saving up for a downpayment on a nearby house. 
They financially planned for this goal, and they have been working 
toward it for years.
  If the Harris plan's subsidy were to go into effect, the prices of 
those homes would increase. They could find themselves further from 
their goal, even if they were able to receive the promised subsidy 
themselves.
  It is a classic example of why progressive economic policies fail. 
Instead of working through a market-focused solution, the Harris plan 
simply throws money on the problem, and it hopes for the best. That is 
not leadership, and that is not going to solve the problem.
  Next, let's talk about rent caps. Earlier this year, the Biden-Harris 
administration announced their intention to impose rent caps on 
``corporate landlords.''
  Rent caps are a failed policy with a long track record of 
exacerbating housing shortages by dissuading developers from building 
new rental units in high-demand areas.
  If investors know that future rent increases will be capped, they 
shift their capital elsewhere. That means less building, less housing 
supply, fewer options, and it drives demand for existing units even 
higher, which pushes rents up in buildings that aren't even subject to 
the caps.
  We have seen how these policies work in New York and San Francisco 
where rent control has been in place for decades.
  According to AEIR, rent control policies in New York City resulted in 
more rental units being abandoned than built in the 1970s and 1980s.
  We can expect more of the same under the Harris plan, which will 
replicate these failures on a national scale.
  To recap, the Harris plan would implement an expensive downpayment 
assistance subsidy. It would hamper new

[[Page H5657]]

development by putting in place rent caps that disincentivize 
investment.
  In other words, Harris would both increase demand and limit supply, 
the exact wrong combination of policies if you want housing costs to go 
down.
  The result is a housing market where both renters and potential 
homeowners are squeezed, leaving everyone with fewer choices and higher 
prices.
  Vice President Harris has said previously that ``Bidenomics is 
working.'' For those that are concerned about rising housing costs, her 
words should be taken literally and taken as a warning.
  Vice President Harris plans to continue the inflationary policies of 
the Biden-Harris administration, exacerbating our housing affordability 
problems and leaving renters with less options and future home buyers 
with even higher costs.
  If America wants to boost housing supply and end the inflationary 
policies of the Biden-Harris era, we need to cut red tape, streamline 
Federal housing programs, and remove barriers to building new units.
  Until we move toward a solution that encourages private investment in 
development, we can expect that our country's housing shortage will 
persist, leaving the American Dream out of reach for everyday working 
families.

    REMEMBERING LARRY FISHER FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO HIS COMMUNITY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. DeSaulnier) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Larry Fisher.
  Throughout his life, Larry showed incredible dedication to his 
community. He was a proud alumnus of the University of Southern 
California. After his graduation from USC, he served as executive 
director of the California Democratic Party. In 1966, he joined Braun 
and Company and rose through the ranks to become CEO of this 
international public relations firm, which eventually became Braun and 
Ketchum.
  In his retirement, Larry moved to the bay area with his wife, Betty, 
and briefly worked as director for Options Recovery in Berkeley, 
California, assisting people through the process of recovering from 
addiction. He then became the spiritual director, working with clients 
to help them find new meaning in life.
  Sadly, Larry passed away this year. Our hearts are with his wife, 
Betty; their children, Timothy and Lara; and the rest of their family. 
Larry will be remembered for his outstanding character and community 
contributions. Please join me in honoring Larry Fisher for his 
incredible impact on his community, his State, and the country.


                Incredible Accomplishments of Amit Elor

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Amit Elor for making history as the youngest wrestler from 
Team USA to earn an Olympic Gold Medal.
  Amit was born and raised in Walnut Creek, California, and has been 
wrestling since the age of 4. In 2022, Amit won under 23, then under 
20, and senior world titles, making her the youngest U.S. senior world 
champion in wrestling. She went on to win those titles again in 2023, 
making her the only wrestler in history to win these three titles 2 
years in a row.
  In August, Amit won an Olympic Gold Medal in the women's freestyle in 
her weight group. Her astonishing skill and unwavering dedication to 
the sport make her an inspiration for the next generation of girls' 
wrestling.
  Our community is incredibly proud of Amit, and it was a delight to 
root for her during the Paris Olympics alongside California's 10th 
Congressional District. Please join me in congratulating Amit Elor on 
her incredible accomplishments and the many more to come.


                   Honoring the Life of Bette Boatmun

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and 
work of Bette Boatmun.
  Bette was a trailblazer for women in leadership in the community, 
water agencies in California, and in special districts. She was a 
native New Yorker who settled in Concord, California, with her family 
of six. In 1974, Bette was appointed to the Contra Costa Water 
District's Board, and she served in that seat for over 46 years. She 
was instrumental in implementing many significant projects, such as 
building the Randall-Bold Water Treatment Plant and expanding Los 
Vaqueros Reservoir.
  Bette was passionate about bringing more women into elected office 
and into the water industry. She was an active member of many 
organizations, including the Concord branch of American Association of 
University Women, Soroptimist International of the Americas, and many 
others.
  In 2020, the Association of California Water Agencies presented her 
with a lifetime achievement award for her lasting contributions to 
California water.
  Sadly, Bette passed away last week, on September 19, and our hearts 
are with her family. Bette will be remembered as a remarkable leader 
and a true visionary when it came to water conservation and women in 
politics. Please join me in honoring Bette Boatmun for her incredible 
impact on our environment, her community, the State of California, and 
this country.

                        SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in observation of Suicide 
Prevention Month, a time to raise awareness on this urgent crisis and 
to rededicate ourselves to watching out and caring for each other, not 
just this month but every single day.
  Suicide is a complex, personal, and devastating moment. The loss of 
life is painful, and the heartbreaking aftermath spreads beyond the 
individual to friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, and society 
itself.
  Whether you are a servicemember, veteran, or civilian, mental health 
challenges affect us all. We must work to end the stigma surrounding 
mental health and asking for help. Seeking help is not a sign of 
weakness. In fact, it is a sign of strength.
  If you or a loved one are struggling with your mental health, please 
know there is a caring community who stands ready to assist. You can 
get help 24/7 by calling or texting 988 or you can chat with the 
Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988lifeline.org.
  During this month, let us dedicate ourselves to shifting public 
perceptions, spreading hope, and sharing vital information and 
resources for people struggling with their mental health.

  Know that you are not alone.


                Addressing Crisis at the Southern Border

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
legislation, H.R. 9678, the FLASH Act.
  For 3\1/2\ years, border districts, like mine, have suffered the 
devastating consequences stemming from the crisis at our southern 
border. As a result, bad actors are emboldened, CBP agents and officers 
are overwhelmed and overworked, our communities have become more 
dangerous, and the environment along the border has been harmed.
  My legislation will address this crisis and secure the border by 
allowing States to place temporary barriers on Federal lands, providing 
for the construction of navigable roads to enhance CBP's ability to do 
their job, and directing Federal managers to develop plans to address 
growing trash piles along the border that hurt our environment.
  Securing the border and protecting the environment are not partisan 
issues. They remain top of mind for the constituents in my entire 
southern Arizona district.
  I remain committed to working with anyone on either side of the aisle 
to find common ground to address the issues impacting communities in my 
district and our Nation.


                        Hispanic Restaurant Week

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1480, 
recognizing Hispanic Restaurant Week, a time to mark and honor the 
significant contribution of Hispanic restaurant owners and workers.
  In southern Arizona and across the United States, countless Hispanics 
have opened a restaurant in search of their American Dream. These 
establishments allow Hispanics to share their rich culinary traditions 
and bold flavors, all while creating jobs and

[[Page H5658]]

strengthening our local economy. Growing up in a Hispanic household 
myself, I can confidently say these are some of the best restaurants in 
our country.
  As a Hispanic myself, I am proud to co-lead this resolution with a 
bipartisan group of colleagues to dedicate this week to Hispanic 
restaurants and thank all of the owners, chefs, servers, dishwashers, 
and more for all their work and contributions to our community and 
Nation.

                     ACCESS PROMOTES UNDERSTANDING

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Kennedy) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th 
anniversary of the Arab-American Community Center for Economic and 
Social Services of WNY. ACCESS was founded to promote understanding and 
foster bonds of friendship between Arab Americans and people of all 
faiths, ethnicities, and backgrounds, recognizing the critical 
importance of dialogue and understanding.
  Over the past 20 years, ACCESS has connected individuals with legal 
services, financial assistance, healthcare, and employment 
opportunities. It provides our young people, who often face uncertain 
and challenging circumstances, with the mentorship and programs 
required to enrich their lives and set them on a path of success for 
the future.
  In addition, ACCESS is committed to aiding immigrants as they pursue 
their dream of citizenship, helping them navigate the application 
process financially, culturally, and linguistically. For refugees 
fleeing persecution, poverty, and violence, ACCESS offers programs that 
help people and families begin new lives, acclimate to life in the 
United States, and thrive.
  I thank Executive Director Talib Abdullah and the leadership of the 
board for their extraordinary efforts meeting our community's needs and 
making western New York a more welcoming and connected home for all.
  Our community and Nation look forward to their continued success and 
congratulate them.


                          Sickle Cell Disease

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of 
the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, 
Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act.
  I am proud to support this critical legislation to reauthorize 
Federal efforts to research, prevent, and treat sickle cell disease 
through 2028.
  Sickle cell disease is an inherited genetic blood condition affecting 
approximately 100,000 Americans and a million people around the world.
  As a clinical nurse specialist caring for sickle cell patients, my 
own mother knew firsthand the hardships stemming from this terrible 
disease, including pain, anemia, infections, and stroke, as well as 
kidney, liver, and heart disease.
  For those with sickle cell, life expectancy is 20 years shorter than 
the average.
  We have more to do, especially as this disease disproportionately 
impacts Black and Latino people who are already facing health 
inequities.
  To put it in perspective, in my home State of New York, one in every 
365 Black babies is born with sickle cell disease.
  During Sickle Cell Awareness Month this September, the legislation 
passed in the House will honor the resilience of those affected by this 
disease, advance important research to improve treatment options, and 
help ensure equitable access to care for all patients. The time to act 
is now.


                     Combating Alzheimer's Disease

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the passage of two 
bipartisan bills that will continue our Nation's commitment to 
researching, treating, and ultimately curing Alzheimer's disease that 
has caused so much heartbreak and pain across the country.
  Families are enduring the profound emotional, physical, and financial 
toll of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Nearly 7 million Americans 
currently live with Alzheimer's, but their burden is not theirs alone. 
Each of those individuals have families and communities that are 
impacted. In fact, the Alzheimer's Association estimates that 11 
million Americans provide unpaid support to patients every year, 
accounting for more than 18 billion hours of care.

  This disease impacts families in every State, city, neighborhood, and 
of all races, incomes, and religions. My own family has felt the pain 
of Alzheimer's, as my grandmother suffered for years with this 
debilitating disease. I watched as my family provided 24-hour care for 
her in her home until the time that she passed.
  It is critical that we make Federal investments to research and 
address Alzheimer's disease and provide resources for the patients and 
families who are impacted. The bipartisan legislation to extend and 
strengthen the National Alzheimer's Project and to develop the Advisory 
Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will go a long way 
to combat this terrible disease.
  I thank the advocates who have volunteered their time caring for 
loved ones, fighting for research funding, and for always keeping faith 
for future generations that will hopefully not have to feel the grief 
of watching a loved one slowly slip away.


                       Remembering Mark Mortenson

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Mark 
Mortenson, who passed on September 14 and whose life work always 
brought beauty and wonder to so many lives in western New York.
  After taking on his most recent role as president and CEO of Buffalo 
and Erie County Botanical Gardens in 2022, Mark was ready to take on a 
new multimillion dollar expansion to fulfill its mission to change the 
region.
  His life will always be remembered in western New York. Our prayers 
are for his loved ones that he left behind: his husband, Curt Maranto; 
and his children, Nicolas, Kiara, Mikey, Elliott, Emily, and the late 
Clayton, who will always be remembered.
  He will be missed. May he rest in peace.

  COMMEMORATING FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF MIDDLEBURG'S 125TH ANNIVERSARY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bean) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Lord says that when two or more 
people gather in prayer, there He will be also. At the First Baptist 
Church of Middleburg this past Sunday, we certainly felt the Lord's 
presence.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a spiritual rock in northeast 
Florida. On September 22, First Baptist Church of Middleburg celebrated 
its 125th anniversary.
  Abby and I had the privilege of attending the commemorative service 
this past Sunday, and when we entered the sanctuary, it was obvious the 
holy spirit was already there. The congregation, the choir, Pastor 
Chris Bonts, and the entire pastoral staff team were celebrating the 
church's long history and its future as a missionary church.
  In 1899, a dozen citizens gathered in the back of a local general 
store to start a church that would honor the Lord and serve Middleburg. 
Mr. Speaker, 125 years later from those humble beginnings, First 
Baptist Middleburg has transformed the lives of thousands through the 
Gospel and community partnerships.
  From youth outreach programs to food pantries to recovery ministries 
for those impacted by addiction and a robust missionary presence around 
the world, First Baptist Middleburg is spreading the good news to 
neighbors and strangers alike.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating First 
Baptist Middleburg's 125 years in service to Him and others. I 
congratulate First Baptist, and let's go get them on the next 125 
years.


                        Honoring Caeleb Dressel

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great 
northeast Florida athlete who made a big splash this summer at the 
Paris Olympics.
  Caeleb Dressel is a Green Cove Springs native who was a Clay High 
Blue Devil who went on to earn--get this--10 NCAA national 
championships at the University of Florida as a Fighting Gator. Caeleb 
is a three-time Olympian, earning a career nine Gold Medals and one 
Silver, placing him in a very elite group of swimmers.

[[Page H5659]]

  Caeleb has the type of resume that can impress almost anyone. In 
addition to holding several current world records in swimming, Caeleb 
was the 2021 Sports Illustrated Male Athlete of the Year.
  Caeleb is a husband and father who takes all his roles seriously.
  In a recent interview, Caeleb talked about the importance of training 
and hard work and the honor of being part of a national team, as well 
as the joy of seeing other people--how about this--reaching their goals 
and dreams. In short, Caeleb Dressel is an inspiration to us all.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join me today in recognizing a 
great American athlete who continues to make Clay County proud. We are 
all so glad it went swimmingly.
  Mr. Speaker, we are proud of Caeleb.
  Go get them, Caeleb.


                          Honoring Ryan Murphy

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, northeast Florida has done it 
again. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a mainstay of U.S. swimming 
and a northeast Florida native who absolutely smashed it at the 2024 
Paris Olympics, Ryan Murphy.
  Ryan hails from Jacksonville and first dreamed about the Olympics 
when he was 7. This Bolles Bulldog has quite the resume. In addition to 
an impressive five Olympic Gold Medals, Ryan is a former and current 
world record holder who medaled in the 100-meter backstroke in three 
Olympic Games.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a 
northeast Floridian who exemplifies American excellence and hard work. 
Ryan Murphy's pool resume is very swim-pressive. Jacksonville and his 
country are proud.
  Whatever his next race is, go get them.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  From the bottom of our hearts, O Lord, we offer our prayers to You. 
Our whole being, we lay before You, trusting that You will receive us 
and will receive our prayers in the mercy of Your loving-kindness.
  Now, having given ourselves to You, our hopes, our fears, our plans, 
and our control, we pray that we will have the faith to lean wholly on 
You and not on our own understanding, that we will believe in Your 
sovereignty that we don't feel like we have to figure everything out on 
our own.
  Instead, may we yield our whole selves, submitting both our pride and 
our will to Your leading. May we loose our grip on the reins and let 
You direct our paths. In everything we do today and everywhere we go, 
may we listen for and heed Your voice.
  In this may our whole spirit, soul, and body be found blameless in 
Your sight.
  In Your gracious name, we pray.
  Amen.

              RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH HONOREES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Hispanic Heritage Month 
to recognize two constituents of our district who have impacted the 
history and culture of Hispanic Americans across Nebraska and the 
Second Congressional District.
  Linda Rivera Garcia and Jose Francisco Garcia, descendants of 
Mexican-born grandparents, founded the Mexican American Historical 
Society of the Midlands. They have dedicated their whole adult lives to 
creating awareness of the rich legacy built by the presence of Mexican 
Americans in the Midlands.
  Linda Garcia grew up on a farm in Papillion, Nebraska, my hometown, 
and attended a one-room country school. She graduated from Papillion 
High School with her brother, representing the only persons of color in 
the late fifties and early sixties. Linda would go on to obtain a 
degree in the arts at the College of Saint Mary in Omaha, Nebraska.
  For over 50 years, Linda has used her artistic presence as a 
community advocate for Mexican Americans. She has received many 
accolades, including being named Hispanic Woman of the Year by the 
Mexican American Commission. The Great Plains Museum in Lincoln and the 
Willa Cather museum in Red Cloud, Nebraska, featured Linda's art 
exhibits. She serves as a storyteller with the National Arts Council 
and Humanities Nebraska and is the artistic director and cultural 
curator of the South Omaha Museum of Immigrant History.

  Jose Garcia was born and raised on the west side of Kansas City, 
Missouri. Growing up, Jose sold TV Guides and worked at a Mexican 
grocery store.
  After graduating high school, he would go on to work at Macy's, Aetna 
Insurance, and the Commerce Trust bank, all while attending night 
school at a junior college.
  In 1966, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam. Jose 
would then use the GI Bill to obtain a degree in psychology from the 
University of Missouri-Kansas City and became involved in the Chicano 
student movement of the time.
  Jose moved to Omaha in 1976 and married the love of his life, Linda, 
in 1977, starting a family just south of Saint Frances Cabrini Church 
in South Omaha. Jose directed the Chicano Awareness Center and, in 
1980, began working with the Chicago & North Western Railroad. 
Additionally, he hosted a community news program called ``Razatimes.''
  Aside from their accomplishments, Linda and Jose would establish 
three ``Houses of Culture,'' ``Casas de Cultural,'' in South Omaha. In 
2009, they founded the Mexican American Historical Society of the 
Midlands to curate, preserve, collect, and exhibit the presence of 
Mexican-American and Latino history, culture, and traditions.
  Through the historical society, the Garcias currently manage a 2,000-
square-foot collection of Chicano, Latino, and Mexican cultural 
materials, images, literature, folk art, and objects documenting the 
postcolonial Spanish-speaking peoples with Midwestern ancestry. They 
also support the South Omaha Museum of Immigrant History.
  The Garcias' lifelong commitment to preserving Hispanic heritage and 
culture will impact future generations. As we reflect on the 
significant contributions of Hispanic Americans to our society and 
culture, I recognize and thank both Garcias for the long-lasting legacy 
they have contributed to Nebraska's Second Congressional District.

                     FOCUSING ON SUICIDE PREVENTION

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

[[Page H5660]]

  

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, September is Suicide 
Prevention Month, and nearly every 12 minutes, an American dies by 
suicide.
  It is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. 
Suicide claims the lives of more than 2,000 Pennsylvanians each year, 
an average of 5 lives a day.
  Madam Speaker, suicide is preventable. Increasing access to crisis 
resources saves lives. Mental and behavioral health research saves 
lives. Ending the stigma surrounding suicide saves lives.
  There is no single cause of suicide, and suicide risk increases when 
several health factors and life stressors converge to create an 
experience of hopelessness and despair.
  Together, we can reverse this course. By making mental health care, 
substance abuse treatment, and suicide prevention a national priority, 
we can reverse the tide on these deaths of despair.
  In fact, in 2020, the U.S. designated 988 as the national suicide and 
crisis hotline, making it easier for all Americans to reach help if 
needed.
  Madam Speaker, let's keep the conversation going year-round. We can 
all play an important role in prevention.

                          ____________________

              RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE ALGENON L. MARBLEY

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 
distinguished service of the Honorable Algenon L. Marbley from my 
district, who has served the Southern District of Ohio since 1997 after 
his appointment by President Clinton and unanimous confirmation by the 
United States Senate.
  In 2019, Judge Marbley became the first Black American to serve as 
chief district judge for the Southern District of Ohio.
  Under his leadership, the court remained one of the Nation's most 
productive, even through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
2023, the district was ranked in the top 15 most productive Federal 
district courts, and his dedication to justice is unparalleled.
  As Chief Judge Marbley celebrates his 70th birthday and concludes his 
tenure, I extend my deepest gratitude and friendship for his service 
and wish him the best as he serves as a senior Federal judge.

                             END HUNGER NOW

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, antihunger advocates across the country 
have been sounding the alarm that hunger is increasing at a disturbing 
rate. In my district, I am seeing longer lines at food banks, empty 
shelves at pantries, and people skipping meals because they can't 
afford food.
  A new report from the Economic Research Service at the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture confirms that about 3 million more people 
live in households struggling with food insecurity in 2023 than in 
2022. In total, 18 million households, 47 million people, are 
struggling to feed themselves and their families. It is shameful.
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, more investments in our antihunger and 
antipoverty safety net helped feed people, and we saw hunger decrease.
  Sadly, Republicans blocked extensions of these programs, and now, we 
have seen hunger increase.
  We have the roadmap. We know what to do. What we need is the 
political will to follow it.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in demanding a 
bipartisan farm bill that improves our Federal nutrition programs, a 
tax bill that reinstates the expanded EITC and child tax credit, and 
legislation to implement the Biden-Harris administration's National 
Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.
  Together, we can end hunger now.

           HONORING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAZARETH UNIVERSITY

  (Mr. MORELLE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th 
anniversary of Nazareth University, led by my dear friend, President 
Beth Paul, which was founded in 1924 by members of the Sisters of St. 
Joseph, a group with which I proudly share a name.
  The five founding sisters saw the school as an opportunity to respond 
to the needs of the time and provide women with educational 
opportunities.
  On September 24, 1924, Nazareth's initial class of 25 began their 
studies in the glass house on Lake Avenue, a date we now recognize as 
Naz Day.
  They set out to create success against all odds, and by every 
measure, it has been an outstanding success.
  One hundred years later, they have grown to a 150-acre campus, with 
nearly 2,500 students in more than 80 academic programs. The legacy of 
the Sisters of St. Joseph lives on through Nazareth's success, and I am 
proud to support their continued growth and prosperity.
  Madam Speaker, here is to the next 100 years.

             OBSERVING CHILDREN'S EMOTIONAL WELLNESS MONTH

  (Mrs. KIM of California asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, September marks National 
Children's Emotional Wellness Month.
  Depression and anxiety impact far too many children and teenagers. 
One in five Americans ages 3 through 17 suffers from an emotional, 
mental, or behavioral disorder, according to NIH.
  Pediatricians, therapists, and mental health care providers work 
around the clock to support the emotional needs and well-being of our 
youth.
  Local nonprofits, such as the Extraordinary Lives Foundation in 
California's 40th District, can also play a role in addressing the 
emotional and mental health challenges among young Americans through 
unique approaches such as therapeutic resources and educational 
opportunities.
  Madam Speaker, I thank our mental health care providers for equipping 
children and families with tools to adapt to difficult circumstances 
and express emotions in a healthy way.
  Together, we will create a better future for our children.

                          ____________________

         PROJECT 2025 PLEDGES EGREGIOUS ASSAULT ON OUR FREEDOMS

  (Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, from imposing a nationwide ban on 
abortion to curbing voting rights to gutting Social Security and 
Medicare, Project 2025 is an extremist MAGA Republican manifesto that 
pledges an egregious assault on our freedoms, our economy, and our 
democracy.
  At the urging of the former President, a small but extreme number of 
House Republicans are threatening to shut down the government unless 
they can impose radical actions of Trump's Project 2025.
  A government shutdown would not only have a devastating economic 
impact, but it would jeopardize the critical services and programs 
American families rely on, hinder our military readiness, and deprive 
veterans of the healthcare they need and benefits they have earned.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
reassess their priorities and prioritize the interests of the American 
people over the interests of the former President. We must keep the 
Federal Government open and keep the Federal Government working for the 
people.

  RECOGNIZING FREDERICKSBURG NATIONALS ON WINNING THE CAROLINA LEAGUE 
                         BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

  (Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Fredericksburg Nationals for winning the Carolina League baseball 
championship.

[[Page H5661]]

  On Wednesday night, the FredNats won the third and deciding game of 
the Carolina League championship series.
  The FredNats took the series 3-0, securing the franchise's first 
league crown since relocating to Fredericksburg in 2020. This run was 
no easy task, and at every game, the FredNats showed us that 
championships are won with passion, grit, and teamwork.
  I must admit that I had the opportunity to throw out the first pitch 
for the FredNats earlier this season, and after that, I definitely knew 
that we should leave baseball to the pros.
  As the Representative for Virginia's Seventh District, I congratulate 
our Fredericksburg Nationals--the players, coaches, staff, and fans--
for a terrific season and this incredible achievement.
  We couldn't be prouder.

        CONGRATULATING BISHOP DR. J.E. REDDICK ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, from a skinny kid who 
preached on a street corner in Kinston, North Carolina, to the national 
president of the National Convention of Free Will Baptists, United 
States of America, overseeing 150,000 members, we owe a great deal of 
honor and gratitude to Johnny Ervin Reddick, also known back home as 
Bishop Dr. J.E. Reddick, on his retirement and life of service.
  At the age of 8, he wanted to preach the Gospel. By 29, he was 
elected the annual bishop/moderator, the youngest in his church's 
history.
  He has served many congregations, including pastoring Mt. Calvary 
Free Will Baptist Church in La Grange for 70 years and Maury Chapel 
Free Will Baptist Church in Hookerton for 60 years.
  Donned in a robe with his cross, his sermons have inspired thousands, 
including me. His true American story, grounded in faith, is about 
serving the Lord and people.
  We thank and honor the bishop for his prayers and inspiration. May 
God bless him.

                     SUPPLEMENTAL DISASTER FUNDING

  (Ms. TOKUDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TOKUDA. Madam Speaker, this week, the House will vote to keep the 
government open until December. While millions of Americans can rest 
assured that critical services will continue, disaster-stricken 
communities like Florida, which is currently facing another hurricane, 
Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Vermont, and yes, my 
community in Maui, have once again been denied the additional support 
they need and they deserve.
  This continuing resolution is yet another missed opportunity to give 
my Maui constituents some certainty in their long road to recovery.
  Just last week, Congressman LaMalfa and I led a bipartisan coalition 
of Members, all representing disaster-affected communities, in calling 
for Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding and the 
Disaster Tax Relief Act to be included in government spending 
legislation. Instead, Congress will leave town this week with little to 
offer.
  Any year-end government spending package must include disaster 
recovery funding. We cannot delay further, not when far too many 
communities like Maui are still waiting and hurting. We owe it to them 
and all our disaster-stricken communities to get this done, and I will 
not stop fighting until we deliver the support they so desperately 
need.

                 HONORING MAJOR GENERAL ONDRA L. BERRY

  (Mr. HORSFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General 
Ondra L. Berry, a leader who has dedicated his life to both his 
community and his country.
  General Berry enlisted in the Nevada Air National Guard in 1986 and 
earned his commission as a second lieutenant by 1990. He served 25 
years with the Reno Police Department, retiring as assistant chief.
  In 2019, he made history as Nevada's first Black adjutant general, 
leading the National Guard through its largest-ever activation during 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
  General Berry's initiatives, including the Battle Born Youth 
ChalleNGe Academy and mental health programs like Purple Resolve have 
impacted countless lives.
  His career has earned him honors like the Legion of Merit and the 
Meritorious Service Medal, and he has served his community by 
cofounding the Northern Nevada Black Cultural Awareness Society and 
serving on several boards.
  I wish General Berry the very best in his well-deserved retirement.

 HONORING JARED ISAACMAN AS FIRST NONPROFESSIONAL ASTRONAUT TO WALK IN 
                                 SPACE

  (Ms. WILD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor one of my 
constituents, Jared Isaacman, who made history earlier this month as 
the first nonprofessional astronaut to walk in space, as part of the 
SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission. While in space, the crew conducted tests 
to study how humans can function in space.
  Jared has long been an integral part of the Lehigh Valley community. 
He is the founder of an Allentown-based company, Shift4, an e-commerce 
payment system now seen all over the world.
  Jared is also a remarkable philanthropist who has positively impacted 
so many lives throughout our district. Thanks to his generous 
contributions, the Lehigh Valley now has an outstanding children's 
hospital at St. Luke's Hospital network.
  Children in our community are able to receive the care they need in a 
less intimidating and more child-friendly environment, helping ease the 
stress of medical visits for kids and parents alike.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Jared for his commitment to our Lehigh Valley 
community, and I congratulate him again on this historic flight.

    HONORING AL McCOY, THE GREATEST BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER OF ALL TIME

  (Mr. STANTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of the 
greatest basketball announcer of all time and Arizona sports legend, 
the voice of the Phoenix Suns, Al McCoy, who passed away recently at 
age 91.
  When fans think of the Phoenix Suns, we hear Al McCoy. When I was 
growing up in Phoenix, NBA games weren't televised, and working-class 
families, like my own, couldn't afford tickets to the Suns games. My 
family experienced the Phoenix Suns sitting around the living room 
radio, listening to the great Al McCoy.
  Al's unforgettable voice took my family with them all the way to the 
1976 championship game against the Boston Celtics, high-fiving each 
other with each ``whammo,'' ``swish-a-roo for two,'' or ``zing go the 
strings,'' and sharing his frustration after a crushing game six 
defeat.
  The Stanton family, like so many Suns fans in Arizona, were brought 
closer together over our shared love for basketball all because of Al 
McCoy.
  Over five decades on the mike, Al's constant presence brought the 
entire Phoenix community together. No matter what was going on in the 
world, Suns fans knew it was going to be a good day when we heard Al 
say ``shazam'' on the radio.
  Madam Speaker, I say Godspeed to Al.

                      DARK DAYS WITH PROJECT 2025

  (Mr. MAGAZINER asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H5662]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MAGAZINER. Madam Speaker, it is no wonder that Donald Trump 
doesn't want people to know that Project 2025 is his plan. It is cruel, 
unpopular, and out of touch with the needs of the American people.
  Among other things, Project 2025 will hand a future Trump 
administration nearly unlimited power, which they will use to eliminate 
health coverage for people with preexisting conditions.
  Do you remember what it used to be like when people would go to the 
doctor, only to be denied healthcare because they had asthma or 
diabetes or cancer? There were no caps on out-of-pocket costs, so a 
trip to the hospital meant that a family could lose everything.
  Donald Trump's Project 2025 plan calls for ending the Affordable Care 
Act and taking us back to the dark days when even people who had health 
insurance would be denied care simply because they had been sick or 
injured in the past. Even the $35 a month cap on insulin would end 
under Donald Trump's Project 2025 plan.
  It is dangerous, it is cruel, it throws the health and safety of 
millions of Americans into jeopardy, and we cannot let Donald Trump and 
congressional Republicans take us back to those dark days.

broad partnership of community, is more than just a building. It is a 
beacon of hope for those facing mental health crises, substance abuse 
recovery, and other urgent health needs.
  The Kaptur-Rogowski House offers a sanctuary where individuals can 
find respite, receive treatment, and begin their journey toward 
recovery with the support of dedicated professionals.
  I am thrilled to see this vision come to life in honor of our mother, 
father, and brother's legacy and reflecting our community's values of 
empathy and support.
  Our work is far from over. This is just one giant step to longer-term 
treatment and a continued effort to ensure every person in America has 
access to the care and support they require.

  Thank you to everyone who has made this possible. Together, we are 
building a better America by making a lasting difference one life at a 
time.

                          HONORING JOHNNY CASH

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today I attended a marvelous program in 
Emancipation Hall where a statue of Johnny Cash was unveiled for time 
immemorial.
  The statue of Johnny Cash was placed there by the State of Arkansas 
who earlier placed the statue of Daisy Bates in the Capitol.
  I commend the State of Arkansas for doing that, and for the 
outstanding addresses by Arkansas legislators, their Governor, and by 
Rosanne Cash, daughter of Johnny Cash.
  Johnny Cash was born in Arkansas, but he came to Memphis to start his 
musical career. He went to Sun Records, and Sam Phillips got him 
started.
  He was at Sun Records on a day when Elvis was there, Jerry Lee Lewis 
was there, and Carl Perkins was there. They put together songs that day 
that Sam Phillips recorded. It was called the Million Dollar Quartet.
  Johnny Cash was a great singer, a great humanitarian, worthy of this 
honor, and someone we should all remember, a life well lived and 
memorialized here in the Capitol.

                       705 Offered by Mr. Burgess

     the Senate.' ''

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The amendment is modified.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, last night, the House Committee on Rules 
met to report House Resolution 1486, providing for the consideration of 
four pieces of legislation.
  First, the rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 1469, 
condemning the Biden-Harris administration and individuals therein 
responsible for the military withdrawal of Afghanistan and subsequent 
evacuation. This will be considered under a closed rule, with 1 hour of 
debate equally divided by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
  Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3334, the STOP 
CCP Act, under a structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided 
by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and provides one motion to recommit.
  Third, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 8205, the Keeping 
Violent Offenders Off Our Streets Act, under a closed rule, with 1 hour 
of debate equally divided between the chair and the ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Judiciary and provides for one motion to 
recommit.
  The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 8790, the Fix Our 
Forests Act, under a structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally 
divided between the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee 
on Natural Resources and provides one motion to recommit.
  Finally, the rule provides clarification in House rules regarding the 
regulations governing the availability of remote witness testimony.
  Madam Speaker, it has been over 3 years since the disastrous 
withdrawal from Afghanistan; 3 years since 13 members of our armed 
services fell on account of the Biden-Harris administration's rushed 
operation to fulfill a campaign promise; 3 years of not one single 
acknowledgment by the President, the Democratic nominee for President, 
the current Vice President, or anyone in the administration, for that 
matter, to acknowledge what happened in August 2021.
  For better or for worse, the American people saw this tragedy with 
their own eyes, as Afghan civilians clung to an airplane leaving Kabul 
airport, and the American people have been awaiting accountability from 
those responsible for a long time.
  Well, that wait ends this week when the House considers H. Res. 1469 
to condemn those in the Biden-Harris administration responsible for the 
events that led up to and unfolded in July and August of 2021.
  Despite the Biden-Harris administration's incessant stonewalling of 
proper congressional oversight and accountability, Chairman McCaul and 
the Foreign Affairs Committee have investigated the events surrounding 
and during the Afghanistan withdrawal. Their recently released report 
is as stunning as it is outrageous.
  The Biden-Harris administration ignored that the Taliban was not 
meeting its obligations under the Doha agreement. For example, the 
Taliban had yet to cut ties with al-Qaida by the time the evacuation 
started, something that the Biden-Harris administration knew.
  Secondly, the administration prioritized optics and political 
expediency over the safety of our servicemembers and civilian 
personnel. The Taliban had already entered Kabul before the evacuation 
of nonmilitary personnel began.
  Third, they failed to plan for the go-to-zero order appropriately, 
which led to the deadliest attack on U.S. military personnel in a 
decade.
  Fourth, the failures damaged America's credibility and standing in 
the world. I cannot stress enough the significance of these events. We 
abandoned our allies, leaving them to slaughter, and allowed terrorism 
once again to flourish in the area.
  Fifth, there was a concerted and deliberate misinformation campaign 
that

[[Page H5664]]

touched nearly every stage of the withdrawal.
  These failures have had a profound impact on our country, but not a 
single person in the Biden-Harris administration has yet been held 
accountable.
  Recruitment into our military has plummeted after the prospective 
servicemembers saw that they would basically be used as disposable 
chess pawns in a political promise.
  The Taliban has organized a de facto permanent regime built on 
torture, violence, and religious and political oppression. Without a 
United States presence in the area, counterterrorism operations have 
been hindered, and foreign adversaries like China have moved in to 
establish diplomatic relations with the regime.
  Most importantly, however, these events signaled weakness, 
emboldening China, Russia, and their proxies to become more aggressive 
with their geopolitical ambitions. China became emboldened to pursue 
its objectives with respect to Taiwan. Russian leaders saw an opening, 
and they invaded Ukraine, knowing that the United States was weak and 
could not be trusted, a shameful and disastrous series of events that 
our country is paying the price for currently and will continue to pay 
this price for decades.
  Afghanistan is not the only area where the Biden-Harris 
administration has shown weakness. This week, the House of 
Representatives will consider the STOP CCP Act, which will impose 
significant and punitive sanctions on individuals of the Chinese 
Communist Party.
  Madam Speaker, there is broad agreement in this body over the 
atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party. Where we seemingly don't 
agree is whether there should be consequences for these atrocities. Up 
to this point, the Biden-Harris administration has yet to impose any 
meaningful sanction on the Chinese Government officials for their 
political and religious oppression of their own people. The STOP CCP 
Act forces the administration to finally do so and speak loudly that 
oppression of God-given rights will be met with consequence.
  Speaking of consequences, the Keeping Violent Offenders Off Our 
Streets Act imposes strict regulations and penalties on charitable bond 
funds, whose funding has exploded in recent years as a result of the 
George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. These funds, like the 
Minnesota Freedom Fund, bail out violent criminals who in many cases 
then go on to commit more crime. H.R. 8205 ensures that these funds are 
subject to penalties and licensing requirements to protect our 
communities and keep criminals where they belong, which is behind bars.

  The final bill provided under the rule, the Fix Our Forests Act, is 
bipartisan legislation that addresses the wildfire crisis across the 
country. Now, in classic fashion, the Biden-Harris administration and 
their allies in Congress spent billions of dollars to address the 
increase in wildfire occurrences and their severity without fixing the 
underlying problem: bureaucratic red tape and extreme environmental and 
serial litigators that prevent the correct management of forests.
  H.R. 8790 makes targeted, yet transformational, changes to the 
Federal agencies responsible for our forests to improve the way we 
manage our forests and ensure projects are not held up in the 
bureaucracy or in the courts.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the 
underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, since day one of this Congress, the Republican 
majority has been a complete and total disaster--failed speakerships, 
failed rules votes, failed bills, failure to address real problems, 
failure to pass real solutions, and failure to even send bills to the 
Senate. Today is more of the same, more failure from this dysfunctional 
Republican majority.
  Speaker Johnson promised he would get all 12 appropriations bills 
across the finish line before August. They couldn't even pass half of 
them. He tried to coax the MAGA extremists into voting for a continuing 
resolution by tacking on more election fraud conspiracies. That plan 
went down in flames.
  Here we are, a week before the government shuts down, and Republicans 
had to move on to a new plan. Despite the Rules Committee taking 
testimony from appropriators last night on the continuing resolution, 
there is no CR in this rule. I checked. I double checked. I made sure 
nothing was stuck to the pages. I looked under the table.
  What was the point of that exercise last night in the Rules Committee 
other than to once again demonstrate that this Republican majority 
cannot fulfill its most basic function, keeping the government open 
without help from Democrats?
  Let's be clear. Their majority is not a working majority. They don't 
have the votes without Democrats, so my friends are putting up a 
continuing resolution on suspension and, once again, they are asking 
Democrats to bail them out.
  Madam Speaker, when will the other side stop letting the MAGA 
extremists run this place?
  Look at the bills that are coming to the floor today: More MAGA 
messaging measures that will never, ever become law. It is pathetic. 
There is a bill that claims to be tough on China. Well, let me tell 
you, there are very few people who are as tough a critic as I am when 
it comes to China's human rights record. I think I am one of a handful, 
only a handful, of legislators in this body and the other body who have 
actually been sanctioned by China. I am not even allowed in the country 
nor is my family. Believe me when I say this is a stupid way to handle 
a complicated geopolitical challenge. We need to be smart on China. We 
need to pass bills that actually get results, not just pass bills that 
sound tough on paper, which is all this bill is.

                              {time}  1245

  Then, we have another no-good bill that Republicans claim will tackle 
crime, but we all know what this is really about. This bill's only 
purpose is to attack Vice President Harris.
  The former President keeps spinning the narrative on the campaign 
trail that crime is at an all-time high. He has trouble with facts.
  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record an 
article: ``Murder and other violent crime dropped across the U.S. last 
year, FBI data shows.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.

                  [From NBC News, September 23, 2024]

 Murder and Other Violent Crime Dropped Across the U.S. Last Year, FBI 
                               Data Shows

                  (By Ryan J. Reilly and Ken Dilanian)

       Washington--Crime, including serious violent incidents like 
     murder and rape, dropped nationally from 2022 to 2023, 
     according to new data released by the FBI on Monday.
       Violent crime was down about 3 percent from 2022 to 2023, 
     and property crime took a similar drop of 2.4 percent, the 
     FBI reported in its annual ``Summary of Crime in the 
     Nation.'' The most serious crimes went down significantly: 
     murder and non-negligent manslaughter were down an estimated 
     11.6 percent--the largest single year decline in two 
     decades--while rape decreased by an estimated 9.4 percent.
       Preliminary numbers showed that 2024 crime numbers were 
     also dropping for the early part of this year, continuing a 
     trend of easing crime as the U.S. has come out of the 
     pandemic.
       Among property crimes, burglary decreased by an estimated 
     7.6 percent. Motor vehicle theft, however, was up by an 
     estimated 12.6 percent between 2022 and 2023. Recorded 
     incidents of shoplifting were also up: from 999,394 in 2022 
     to 1,149,336 in 2023, which is roughly the same level of 
     incidents reported in 2019, before the pandemic. (Store 
     closures and COVID-19 security measures likely decreased 
     shoplifting in 2020 and 2021, and may have affected 2022 
     incidents as well.)
       Public perception of crime is often out of step with the 
     facts, especially in the age of social media, ease of digital 
     communications between neighbors and doorbell cameras, when 
     Americans may be more aware of individual crimes than they 
     would have been in the past.
       But the violent crime rate dropped from 2022 to 2023, from 
     377.1 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2022 to 363.8 
     violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2023, the new FBI data 
     shows.
       As part of his 2024 campaign, former President Donald Trump 
     has tried to spread the notion that the United States is 
     undergoing a crime wave, and he called the FBI's prior 
     numbers a ``fraud'' during his debate with

[[Page H5665]]

     Kamala Harris, saying that some cities weren't included. But 
     the FBI factors in the information gaps into their estimates. 
     The bureau noted that its 2023 data included full-year 
     numbers from ``every city agency covering a population of 
     1,000,000 or more inhabitants.''
       Overall, the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System 
     (NIBRS) collected information from 700 additional agencies in 
     2023 compared to 2022. The total population covered by the 
     report is more than 315 million people, or 94.3 percent of 
     the country.
       President Joe Biden issued a statement saying the FBI 
     numbers confirm ``that Americans are safer than when we took 
     office,'' adding violent crime was near a 50-year low.
       ``None of this happened by accident. Vice President Harris 
     and I invested in public safety and took action to stop the 
     illegal flow of guns into our communities. Our American 
     Rescue Plan--which every Republican in Congress voted 
     against--helped deliver over $15 billion in public safety 
     funding that enabled over 1,000 state, city, and county 
     governments to avoid cuts to police budgets, invest in 
     community violence interventions, and take other essential 
     steps to keep communities safe,'' Biden said.

  Mr. McGOVERN. This report was released yesterday, by the way. The 
data shows that violent crime has dropped in recent years, but 
Republicans are ignoring these facts and choosing to push messaging 
bills like this one instead.
  It really is quite sad that that is kind of the state of affairs on 
the Republican side.
  Look, I get it. I get it. My Republican friends are afraid because 
Vice President Harris was a prosecutor who put felons in jail, and, 
well, I will just let everyone who is watching fill in the rest.
  Then, we have an absurd, nonbinding resolution that politicizes the 
U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Playing politics with this is 
disgusting.
  This is not about honoring our fallen soldiers. This is about 
politics at its worst.
  This bill didn't even go through regular order. It was introduced 5 
days ago and didn't go through committee.
  Republicans were so anxious to get this resolution to the floor 
before the election that they didn't even get Members' input. Was it 
written by the Trump campaign? I mean, give me a break.
  This is not the way we honor our fallen soldiers. We don't play 
politics with tragedies.
  Let me just state for the record, thanks to President Biden and Vice 
President Harris, for the first time in decades, the United States is 
not at war anywhere in this world.
  Finally, we have the Fix Our Forests Act. In my opinion, this is a 
pro-polluter bill that ignores the realities of climate change when it 
comes to wildfires.
  I will be opposing this bill because the so-called Fix Our Forests 
Act will not fix our forests. Instead, I think it would bypass critical 
environmental laws, cut out scientific input, and undermine our 
Nation's core environmental laws.
  Madam Speaker, look, here is the reality: Republicans have fumbled 
left and right over the last 2 years. They really have become the party 
of broken promises, wasting everybody's time and wasting taxpayer money 
on absurd messaging bills that are going nowhere.
  While we have real challenges in this country, this is the junk they 
bring to the floor. People want us to work together to get things done, 
and instead, this majority spends their time fighting amongst 
themselves and accomplishing absolutely nothing for the American 
people.
  It is simple, really. The other side wants to come down here and talk 
about anything other than their plans for the future because when they 
do that, people see how weird they are.
  They don't want to talk about Project 2025, their dystopian plan to 
take total control of our country, dismantle our system of checks and 
balances, and take away people's freedoms.
  They don't want to talk about how their draconian abortion bans are 
killing women and putting them at extreme risks.
  They don't want to talk about how 9 years after starting to run for 
President, Donald Trump still doesn't have an actual plan to provide 
better healthcare for the American people.
  They don't want to talk about how Donald Trump's big economic plan 
would result in average families spending an extra $4,000 per year--
$4,000 more per year that families would pay if his plans were enacted.
  They come down here and bring up some absurd messaging bills to avoid 
talking about how weird and unpopular their agenda is.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, before I go to the gentleman from New York, I do want 
to point out that, sadly, in January of this year, January 29, 2024, 
three U.S. soldiers were killed in Jordan. The three soldiers are 
Sergeant William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Georgia; Specialist 
Kennedy Ladon Sanders of Waycross, Georgia; and Specialist Breonna 
Alexsondria Moffett of Savannah, Georgia. All were assigned to the 
718th Engineer Company, 926th Engineer Battalion, Fort Moore, Georgia.
  Do not continue to repeat the lie that we have no soldiers standing 
in harm's way during the Biden administration. It was brought up during 
the debate by the Vice President. It was wrong then. It is wrong now.
  We have soldiers on the ground in Iran and Syria. Of course, there 
are soldiers deployed in the Continent of Africa. We can't forget 
everything that is happening right now with the Houthi rebels placing 
our servicemembers in danger.
  Do not make the mistake that the world is completely at peace under 
the beneficence of the current Biden administration.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Langworthy), a valuable member of the Rules Committee.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this 
rule, which will provide consideration for commonsense legislation that 
would hold accountable local leaders that are pushing an antipolice, 
pro-crime agenda on our States and cities.
  Madam Speaker, as the only New Yorker on this side of the aisle 
today, I can tell you that I have seen firsthand what happens when a 
Democrat-run State bows to the radical left and embraces the 
unaccountable system of charitable bail funds and institutes full-blown 
bail reform.
  Violent offenders are getting a free pass while law-abiding citizens 
are left to suffer. Look at the facts: In New York City, after bail 
reform, crime jumped 20 percent after they pushed for this in the name 
of social justice. Judges can't even set bail for crimes like petty 
larceny or grand larceny or burglary.
  Who pays the price? Innocent American families.
  Now, unfortunately, my home State of New York is just one of many 
Democrat-run States in jurisdictions around the country that have given 
criminals a get-out-of-jail-free card.
  What is worse is that these policies have the full backing of the 
Democratic Party, including their nominees, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. 
Harris, in particular, supported these radical bail funds, actively 
encouraging donations to bail out criminals, many of whom were charged 
with violent crimes. They are the faces of a party that have abandoned 
the safety of our communities in favor of appeasing a far-left mob.

  Democrats would have you believe that these policies are about 
helping lower-income communities, but let's be perfectly, honestly 
clear: These policies are hurting the very people they claim to 
protect.
  These multimillion-dollar bail funds, like the Minnesota Freedom Fund 
and The Bail Project, aren't helping. They are putting violent 
criminals, domestic abusers, and sexual predators right back on the 
street.
  Who suffers? Everyday Americans in cities like New York, Chicago, and 
San Francisco. These so-called reforms are nothing more than a betrayal 
of the people and a destruction of the rule of law in this country.
  Look no further than the facts. Groups like the Minnesota Freedom 
Fund bailed out individuals charged with violent crimes, including 
domestic violence and sexual assault, and Democrats are more than happy 
to just look the other way. They decided that protecting a radical base 
is more important than protecting the innocent victims.
  This is what the Biden-Harris administration and Democrats across 
this

[[Page H5666]]

country have stood for, policies that prioritize criminals over 
communities, chaos over safety, and special interests over the 
hardworking American people. They have abandoned our law enforcement. 
They have turned their backs on the very citizens they were elected to 
serve.
  I call on my colleagues across the aisle to listen to their 
constituents in their own Democrat-run States and cities who are 
absolutely fed up with rampant violent crime and fed up with the 
revolving door prison and jail system that Democrats and their bail 
funds have facilitated.
  They are sick and tired of watching their communities deteriorate and 
small businesses have to close due to crime skyrocketing.
  The least we can do, Madam Speaker, is ensure that these bail funds 
operate under some level of accountability and transparency.
  Madam Speaker, I strongly support this rule today and the underlying 
legislation.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Texas says that the Biden 
administration is weak. I guess the gentleman and I have a different 
definition of what weakness looks like.
  It was Republicans, by the way, not Joe Biden, who held up aid for 
our allies for 9 months because their side buys into Kremlin 
propaganda. I think that is weak, quite frankly.
  It was a Republican President who went to North Korea and tried to 
get a brutal dictator to like him. He actually said they wrote each 
other love letters. He went there and groveled to Kim Jong Un. I don't 
think that that is a sign of strength. I think that is a sign of 
weakness.
  It is the Republican candidate for President who praises Putin on a 
regular basis, calls him Vladimir, loves Xi Jinping, says Viktor Orban 
is fantastic.
  Don't even lecture us about human rights when the majority can't 
bring itself to be critical of what the Republican standard-bearer says 
on a regular basis. That is not strength. That is pathetic. It makes us 
look weak.
  Meanwhile, after they wrecked our image on the world stage, it is 
President Joe Biden who has had to rebuild it. I don't call that 
weakness. I call that a sign of strength. Standing with our NATO 
allies, standing with the people of Ukraine as Russia drops bombs on 
them on a regular basis, that is not weakness. That is strength.
  The gentleman from New York, I mean, listening to him speak, one 
would think that we are living in 14th century Europe during the black 
plague.
  The fact is that we live in the best place in the world. There is no 
other place in the world I would rather live than in the United States 
of America, and it is the best time in history, quite frankly, for a 
whole bunch of reasons.
  Please don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say that none of our 
soldiers were in harm's way. I said we are living in a time when we 
were not at war with any country. That is what I said. I have to insist 
on accuracy when it comes to my words.
  We can do better, and we should work to improve the lives of the 
people we represent.
  Crime is down. The gentleman from New York who just spoke apparently 
wasn't here when I inserted the FBI report, but that is facts. Crime is 
down.
  The economy is strong and growing stronger.
  Science is improving our lives in new ways every single day. It is 
amazing.
  The Republican agenda of division and hate only takes us backward. 
Let's go forward. Let's work together on something, and maybe we can 
start today. Rather than politicizing the tragic deaths of American 
servicemen, maybe we can start the day today by actually helping our 
veterans, something that my Republican friends have a hard time trying 
to do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question, and if we 
defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to 
include an additional $12 billion in the continuing resolution that our 
Nation's veterans need for their healthcare.
  Madam Speaker, let's remember how we got here. Republicans talked a 
big game all Congress about how they were going to return to regular 
order and pass 12 individual appropriation bills, but consistent with 
the theme of dysfunction for this Republican majority, they instead 
spent months fighting amongst themselves.
  What was the result? How many awful, partisan, go-nowhere 
appropriation bills were they actually able to pass? Madam Speaker, 5, 
5 out of 12, and they didn't even send the Homeland Security 
appropriations bill over to the Senate. Why? Because they threw a 
tantrum and refused to send their Homeland Security appropriations bill 
to the Senate unless their awful H.R. 2 border bill got signed into 
law.

  That is not how this works. They need to watch ``Schoolhouse Rock!'' 
Maybe they can learn something.
  Once again, Democrats are the adults in the room who are being asked 
to come in and clean up the Republican mess--in this case, to ensure 
that our basic responsibility of governing is met: Keeping the lights 
on.
  Now, the continuing resolution that we will consider later this week 
has some good pieces in it, and it will keep the American people's 
government open for another 3 months, but there is always room for 
improvement.
  That is why I am offering this amendment to provide an extra $12 
billion to maintain medical care for veterans, money that the 
Department of Veterans Affairs says that they will need. Our veterans 
deserve our support. It is our responsibility to provide the care that 
they have earned.
  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material 
immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Deluzio) to discuss our proposal.

                              {time}  1300

  Mr. DeLUZIO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me 
time.
  This country has a sacred obligation to America's veterans, to my 
fellow veterans. It is a promise that after we complete our service in 
uniform to this great Nation, our government will, in turn, deliver the 
care and benefits that we have earned.
  For too long, this promise has been broken for so many of my fellow 
veterans, and finally, we are making some progress.
  The Honoring our PACT Act and the Cost of War Toxic Exposure Fund 
have helped my fellow toxic-exposed veterans and their survivors get 
the healthcare and benefits they have long earned but only recently 
were offered.
  More veterans than ever are now receiving life-changing benefits. 
Over the last 2 years, VA has approved more than 1.2 million PACT Act 
claims, and the Veterans Health Administration is expected to serve 127 
million appointments by the end of this year. That is 7 million more 
than 2023.
  This growth in the number of claims and appointments has outpaced 
VA's initial estimates, causing the funding shortfall that the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) alluded to.
  I say it is about time that more of my fellow veterans receive the 
care they have earned. It is our sacred obligation here in this Chamber 
and this Congress to ensure our veterans are taken care of, and that 
includes paying for the cost of war.
  We have got to make sure the VA is fully staffed, it is modernized, 
and it is able to meet the needs of my fellow veterans.
  While there is no funding shortfall for this fiscal year, next year 
we expect the Veterans Health Administration to cross that red line 
around March of 2025. That is exactly why the now-failed Republican 6-
month CR proposal last week would have been a disaster.
  Since the current proposed CR goes until December, we have time to 
address this $12 billion shortfall, so we are submitting this amendment 
to appropriate $12 billion for the VA Cost of War Toxic Exposure Fund.
  Caring for veterans is part of the cost of war, and patriotic 
Americans expect us to pay for it.

[[Page H5667]]

  We cannot have veterans miss out on the hard-earned benefits they 
earned through their service, and we cannot send Americans off to war 
and then pinch pennies when the bill comes due, especially when 
billionaires and huge corporations don't pay their fair share in taxes 
in this country.
  House Democrats are committed to getting veterans the healthcare and 
the benefits that we are owed. That was the PACT Act's commitment, and 
we intend to keep that promise.
  I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can keep 
this country's obligation.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  First off, I do want to remind the House that the House passed $3 
billion in veterans funding last week and sent it over to the Senate. 
This gives us time to act on further veterans funding prior to the 
December 20 deadline that will be part of the continuing resolution 
that will pass later this week.
  The Military Construction-VA appropriations bill was, in fact, the 
first House-passed appropriations bill. Representative Carter from 
Texas led that subcommittee and passed that bill much earlier in the 
year. It has been sitting over in the Senate. It hasn't seen any 
activity. That bill actually could have been passed by both the House 
and the Senate and signed by the President of the United States.
  I am grateful that my counterpart, the ranking member of the 
committee, allowed you to see, Madam Speaker, what I live with on a 
daily basis, which is a severe case of Trump derangement syndrome. We 
see it on display in the Rules Committee almost continuously. You have 
heard a brief exposure of that today on the floor of the House.
  I apologize to the country that they had to put up with that, but, 
again, this is my life in the Rules Committee. Trump derangement 
syndrome is alive and well and put forth on virtually every argument 
that goes forth in the Rules Committee.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I would just say to the gentleman from Texas that I am sorry that I 
guess I hurt his feelings with some of the things I have said, but it 
is the truth, and I guess the truth hurts.
  Madam Speaker, earlier I said that this majority has turned the 
Republican Party into a circus of chaos, broken promises, and failures.
  Let's talk about that just a little bit more, shall we?
  Since last January, this majority wasted 26 entire days, nearly a 
month, on fighting with each other as they tried to elect a Speaker of 
the House. Madam Speaker, 5 days were spent electing Kevin McCarthy, 
who was then booted out of the speakership and ended up leaving office. 
Madam Speaker, 21 days were spent as the Republican Conference argued 
about who was next in line. We ended up with Speaker Johnson, and we 
went from a bad Speaker to an even worse one.
  That is nearly a month. That is nearly a month completely wasted on 
nothing more than bickering amongst themselves.
  I will also remind you, Madam Speaker, the House was held hostage for 
days in June of last year because a tiny, extreme faction of the 
Republican Conference chose to throw a fit over the debt deal 
negotiated by President Biden and Speaker McCarthy.
  Republicans struck down a rule on the floor for the first time in 
over two decades, holding the House floor schedule hostage all for 
camera time while MAGA threw a fit.
  Now, we have seen a total of seven failed rules in this Congress, 
seven. Hell, we have even seen Republicans vote down not just the rules 
but vote down their own bills because there are times even conservative 
Members have thought the MAGA weirdo bills are just too weird and too 
extreme.

  Get this, Madam Speaker, even when House Republicans manage to 
succeed, they fail to govern.
  We keep hearing them complain about the border.
  News flash, they passed the Department of Homeland Security funding 
bill 3 months ago, and they never sent it to the Senate. They put it in 
a filing cabinet and locked the door.
  What is this, hide and seek? They are passing bills and hiding them 
in the basement so they can complain about the border more and more and 
more instead of trying to fix it. Someone needs to show these guys 
``Schoolhouse Rock!'' I mean, we are talking about their number one 
priority, and they don't even send the bill over to the Senate.
  It just shows how fake all their outrage is about the border.
  I will leave you with this, Madam Speaker: Despite all the talk from 
this Republican majority that the 118th Congress would be the most open 
Congress ever, last night Republicans, again, broke their own record 
for the most closed Congress in the history of the country.
  In addition to being the most ineffective and dysfunctional Congress 
in history, it is now also the most closed. Republicans have advanced 
106--I am sorry. It is actually now 108. There are two more closed 
rules in the rule we are talking about today. Before they broke their 
record, their previous record was 103 closed rules when Paul Ryan was 
Speaker.
  That means that they broke their own record for the most closed 
Congress in history. They are going to be unbeatable when it comes to a 
closed Congress.
  Madam Speaker, it is more than about numbers. It is about what they 
represent.
  As of this week, Republicans have now blocked 5,822 amendments from 
debate. They have even blocked the majority of their own Members' 
amendments from coming to the floor from debate.
  It is ironic, the party that calls us snowflakes is afraid to even 
allow debate on the merits of these amendments.
  Every amendment they block is another idea that is prevented from a 
vote on the House floor.
  Now, let's look at some of the examples of what they thought was too 
crazy to bring to the floor.
  They blocked an amendment blocking smuggling of U.S. firearms across 
the Mexican border. They thought that was too radical to bring to the 
floor.
  They blocked an amendment protecting food for seniors participating 
in Meals on Wheels.
  They blocked an amendment providing postpartum mental health 
information to pregnant students. By the way, that was a Republican 
amendment.
  Look, we know Republicans have the majority. These amendments might 
lose, but a truly open and inclusive process that Republicans promised 
would let us debate these issues on the merits.
  It is all part of a pattern. They are afraid of debating because they 
don't want to engage on policy. For them this is all just a game. It is 
about trying to hold onto power for the sake of holding onto power.
  It is one broken promise after another from these guys. The truth is, 
Republicans have nothing, nothing, nothing to show for their time in 
power, just incompetence and chaos.
  That is why I think people will be rejecting them in November.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  The rules brought forth today, two are closed, but in both instances, 
neither received an amendment in which to make in order. If there are 
no amendments, by definition, then it is a closed rule.
  I do want to point out that this majority has reported nearly twice 
the number of bills as the last Congress when the gentleman, the 
ranking member, was, in fact, the chairman of the committee. I would 
also like to point out that since there was a change in the chairman of 
the Rules Committee, all Rules Committee votes have passed on the 
floor. I hope that pattern continues today.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  The gentleman just put forward a straw man argument. The way it 
usually works is the Rules Committee sends out a notice asking for 
amendments that sets a deadline. It gives a week for our people to 
construct their ideas and send them to the Rules Committee.

[[Page H5668]]

  On this package, they never sent out a notice or a deadline. I mean, 
the reality is, I think everybody already knew what was coming.
  I am going to tell you, there is no defense for being the most closed 
Congress in the history of the United States. They fight amongst 
themselves and they basically work overtime to prevent thoughtful ideas 
from coming to the floor. They are good about debating trivial issues 
passionately, but they are not very good about debating important ones. 
Everything that they bring to the floor is not about moving the ball 
forward in terms of helping improve the quality of life for the 
American people. It is all about messaging and gotcha and division and 
pushing hate in this country. It just has to stop, and hopefully it 
will.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how many speakers 
the gentleman has remaining?
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close after the 
gentleman closes.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 8\1/2\ minutes remaining.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

  Madam Speaker, I have already spoken about why these messaging 
measures will do nothing to help Americans, what a complete disaster 
this dysfunctional Republican majority has been, and how their weird, 
unpopular agenda is wrong for this country.
  Now, I want to speak to you, Madam Speaker, and to the American 
people about the alternative, about what President Joe Biden, Vice 
President Kamala Harris, and Democrats here in Congress have 
accomplished and what we will continue to fight for in the years to 
come.
  Democrats delivered the American Rescue Plan, helping to end the 
COVID crisis and reopening our economy that was shut down under Donald 
Trump.
  Democrats delivered the CHIPS and Science Act, bringing jobs back 
from China and supply chains back from overseas.
  Democrats delivered the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a 
historic investment that will rebuild our infrastructure for 
generations and generations to come.
  Democrats delivered the bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act, expanding 
VA healthcare and benefits for millions and millions of veterans who 
have been exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.
  Democrats delivered the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most 
significant piece of gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 
years.
  That is what leadership looks like. It looks like making this country 
better. It looks like imagining and doing big things. It looks like 
finding common ground across the aisle where and when we can. It looks 
like delivering real, concrete results for the people of this country.
  Democrats fight for lower prices. We fight to build an opportunity 
economy. We fight to protect our freedoms. We fight to ensure liberty 
and justice for every single American.
  We believe good policy can unite people. We want to bring people 
together and focus on what we have in common in this country because 
there is so much more that unites us than divides us.

                              {time}  1315

  Madam Speaker, people are fed up with this majority's dysfunction. 
They are fed up with Republican incompetence.
  What we Democrats, President Biden, and Vice President Harris offer 
is the opposite. Instead of division, Democrats offer unity. Instead of 
talking about the past and complaining, Democrats talk about the future 
and giving people hope. Instead of dysfunction, we will run this 
country like professionals and get stuff done to make America the best 
it can be.
  The choice this November is a consequential one, Madam Speaker, and 
we can continue down the same failed path of dysfunction and disarray, 
or we can fire this failed MAGA majority. We can let Republicans keep 
sowing anger and hate, or we can let Democrats bring some decency and 
dignity back to this place. We can let Republicans continue fighting 
with each other, or we can let Democrats fight on behalf of the 
American people.
  That is what is on the line this November, and the choice could not 
be more clear.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 14 minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time on 
the Republican side.
  Madam Speaker, it is ironic that we keep hearing about unity. I heard 
the word ``unity'' I don't know how many times during the inaugural 
address of President Biden, yet it is virtually impossible for a 
Republican to get a telephone call answered from the head of any 
Federal agency.
  This has been the most walled-off administration that I have ever 
seen. I served in the Bush Presidency, the Obama Presidency, and the 
Trump Presidency, and I have never seen an administration that behaves 
in the way this administration does.
  The gentleman referenced the aid to the country of Ukraine. I voted 
for that aid package in June 2022. We didn't get a lot of information 
before the bill was brought to the floor. Then-Speaker Pelosi brought 
it rather hurriedly. It came to the Rules Committee in an emergency 
hearing, but what was happening in Ukraine seemed so horrific that any 
ability to help seemed important.
  Then I waited after that vote. I waited for the administration to 
come to talk to us about what the strategy is, where we are going, and 
what the plan is. Is there an exit strategy out there somewhere?
  Again, we had another vote last March, once again hoping that the 
administration would begin to behave differently and at least inform 
the Congress of what their plans were. I voted again for that aid 
package. I caught a lot of grief from my constituents back home for 
voting for that package. At the same time, once again, no information 
was forthcoming from the administration, no plan and no strategy.
  Madam Speaker, we had big meetings over in the auditorium in the 
Capitol Visitor Center just prior to the invasion of Ukraine. All the 
generals and Cabinet Secretaries were there. They told us that it was 
too late, that there was nothing we could do, and that Ukraine would 
fall in 3 days. They didn't.
  That is when the administration came back and started asking for 
these aid packages, but never once did they fill in the blanks of: this 
is what we plan to do, this is where we plan to go.
  Even today, the administration seems to be arguing with itself. Do we 
allow for Ukraine to use that aid in a more robust way to defend 
itself, or is it all just purely risk-averse defense spending that they 
will do?
  Again, we don't know. I would love to hear the administration give us 
a reason why it is important to continue to send American tax dollars 
because they have a plan for victory and a plan for ending the war.
  We heard a lot of discussion about the previous administration, the 
Trump administration, and the world was never more prosperous and at 
peace.
  Madam Speaker, do you remember the comment in early October last year 
when the statement was made by the administration that they have never 
seen the Middle East more quiet than it is today? Oh, my God, where are 
we now? Where are we now?
  Where are the plans of the administration? When are they going to 
come to talk to us about the correct way forward?
  We hear arguments internally, arguments with the administration 
arguing with itself. We heard the Vice President and the President 
basically arguing about the way forward with what to do with the 
problems in the Middle East, but, again, no one comes to us and lays 
out what the plan is going forward.
  Madam Speaker, I have never seen a world more dangerous than it is 
today. I feel as if we are living on a knife's

[[Page H5669]]

edge and that, at any point, one false move, one miscalculation by one 
individual, could lead the world into a confrontation and conflagration 
the likes of which the world has never seen before.
  We do need to be concerned about that. We do need the United States 
to lead. We need a strong leader in the United States, and I would 
argue that the prior President evidenced that type of strong 
leadership, and the world was a safer place. The world was a more 
prosperous place.
  Now, since the gentleman brought up the Inflation Reduction Act and 
the American Rescue Plan, these were the very matches that lit the fuse 
on inflation in this country in January 2021.
  Inflation was at 1.6 percent in December 2020. Then, a year later, 
where was it? It was going up toward 8 percent.
  The Secretary of the Treasury said she thought it would be 
transitory. The Chair of the Federal Reserve thought it would self-
correct. Then it didn't, and the American people suffered.
  Why weren't we concerned about the suffering of the American people 
in the last Congress when we continued to lay spending bill over 
spending bill, which the people could no longer afford?

  So, yes, it is tough. Now, we are having to dial some of that back, 
and it is not easy. Any time the Federal Government spends a dollar, it 
immediately creates a constituency, and it is difficult to dial those 
dollars back.
  We argue with ourselves here in the Congress about what the best path 
forward is, but at the same time, we have an obligation. We have an 
obligation to fund the government, which we will have an opportunity to 
do later this week.
  Madam Speaker, I do want to urge colleagues to support this rule. I 
do want to encourage colleagues to support the underlying legislation. 
I do want us to hold the Federal agencies accountable to the American 
people, solve critical issues for our constituents, and restore 
American strength on the world stage.
  I said in committee yesterday that these bills are about 
accountability to the governed, respect for law and order, strength on 
the world stage, and rightsizing Federal agencies. These are the core 
tenets of House Republicans. That is what we pledged to the American 
people, and it is what the American people expect from this body.
  Madam Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support the rule and 
support the underlying legislation.
  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:

 An Amendment to H. Res. 1486 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts

       At the end of the resolution, add the following:
       Sec. 6. No motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 9747 
     shall be in order that does not provide that the bill is 
     considered as amended as follows.
       Sec. 7. The amendment referred to in section 6 is as 
     follows:
       ``Division A of H.R. 9747 is amended by inserting after 
     section 152 the following:
       Sec. 153. In addition to amounts otherwise available for 
     such purposes, there are appropriated, out of any money in 
     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for investment in 
     the delivery of veterans' health care associated with 
     exposure to environmental hazards, the expenses incident to 
     the delivery of veterans' health care and benefits associated 
     with exposure to environmental hazards, and medical and other 
     research relating to exposure to environmental hazards, as 
     authorized by section 324 of title 38, United States Code, 
     $12,000,000,000, which shall remain available until September 
     30, 2029.''

  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.

                          FIX OUR FORESTS ACT


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and insert extraneous material on H.R. 8790.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 8790.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald) to 
preside over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1421


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8790) to expedite under the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 and improve forest management activities on National Forest System 
lands, on public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land 
Management, and on Tribal lands to return resilience to overgrown, 
fire-prone forested lands, and for other purposes, with Mr. Fitzgerald 
in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Natural Resources or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Porter) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8790, the Fix Our Forests 
Act, a bipartisan forestry package that I am proud to lead with my good 
friend and colleague from California (Mr. Peters) and which passed out 
of the Natural Resources Committee earlier this year by voice vote.
  This comprehensive package is the product of many months of hard work 
and bipartisan collaboration. This bill was not formulated in 
Washington, D.C. From field hearings in the shadow of Half Dome in 
Yosemite National Park to site visits to Tribal reservations in New 
Mexico, we have traveled the country to hear from experts and find 
consensus on the best approaches to improve the management of our 
Nation's forests.
  I may be the only licensed forester in Congress, but you don't need a 
forestry degree to understand that our Nation's dire forest health 
crisis demands our immediate attention. This year alone, wildfires have 
burned more than 7.3 million acres nationally. In the past 10 years, 
wildfires in the U.S. have burned over 73 million acres, roughly the 
same area as the State of Arizona.
  Catastrophic wildfires are much more than just statistics. They 
destroy lives. They destroy property. They degrade our air and water 
quality, turn abundant wildlife habitat into moonscapes, and create 
billions of dollars in economic damage.
  One of the most tragic consequences of the wildfire crisis is seeing 
entire communities in the path of uncontrollable megafires leveled year 
after year.
  The 2018 Camp fire in California destroyed the towns of Paradise and 
Concow, burning over 18,000 structures and killing 85 people. In 2020, 
the North Complex fire completely engulfed and demolished the towns of 
Berry Creek and Feather Falls, wiping out over 2,300 structures. Just 
last year, I saw firsthand the immediate aftermath of the devastating 
wildfire in Maui that destroyed the historic town of Lahaina, causing 
untold damages.
  Behind these examples are real people who are left to pick up the 
pieces and communities that will never be the same again. With over 1 
billion acres at risk for wildfire across the country, we sadly know 
these tragedies will persist without intervention. In fact, the Forest 
Service has identified more than 70,000 communities and 44 million 
homes that are at risk of experiencing a catastrophic wildfire in the 
wildland-urban interface.
  The good news is that we know what needs to be done. We must increase 
the pace and scale of scientifically proven forest management to 
restore health and resiliency to our Nation's forests.
  The Fix Our Forests Act will restore forest health, increase 
resiliency to catastrophic wildfires, and protect vulnerable 
communities. Right now, it takes 3 to 5 years to begin work on a forest 
management program. This bill simplifies and streamlines cumbersome and 
costly environmental reviews so that, if enacted, land managers could 
go into our forests the next day and begin the work we know needs to 
happen.

  H.R. 8790 empowers States, Tribal, local, and private partners to get 
more work done on the ground by strengthening the Good Neighbor 
Authority and Stewardship Contracting.
  This bill also creates a framework for prioritizing treatments in our 
most at-risk areas. By encouraging the adoption of innovative science 
and technology, we can improve wildfire suppression capabilities, lower 
costs, and protect communities.
  The best part is that we will save a pound in cure by investing a 
penny in prevention. The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that 
reducing the risk of wildfires will lower wildfire suppression costs, 
allowing us to invest more in proactive, preventative forest 
management. If you believe that money is the only thing that will fix 
this problem, then you should vote for the Fix Our Forests Act because 
the bill will free up financial resources to

[[Page H5674]]

invest in critical forest management work.
  This is a good bill that will help us finally turn the tide against 
the historic forest health crisis. I thank Members on both sides of the 
aisle who have contributed their input and ideas to this bipartisan 
product. I am proud to support even more bipartisan amendments offered 
by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today.
  They say the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best 
time is today. While we can't reverse the decades of inadequate forest 
management that have led us to this dire juncture, we can take a 
positive step today that will ensure healthier forests and communities 
for our children far into the future.
  Mr. Chair, I support the bill and reserve the balance of my time.
                                         House of Representatives,


                                     Committee on Agriculture,

     Hon. Bruce Westerman,
     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual 
     understanding regarding H.R. 8790, the ``Fix Our Forests 
     Act''. Thank you for collaborating with the Committee on 
     Agriculture on the matters within our jurisdiction.
       The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further 
     consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing 
     consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction 
     over any subject matter contained in this or similar 
     legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the 
     right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of 
     conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support 
     such a request.
       We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming 
     this understanding with respect to H.R. 8790 and request a 
     copy of our letters on this matter be published in the 
     Congressional Record during Floor consideration.
           Sincerely,
                                            Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,
     Chairman.

       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 8790, the ``Fix 
     Our Forests Act,'' which was ordered reported by the 
     Committee on Natural Resources on June 26, 2024.
       I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall 
     within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and 
     appreciate your willingness to forgo any further 
     consideration of this bill. I acknowledge that the Committee 
     on Agriculture will not formally consider H.R. 8790 and agree 
     that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill 
     does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter 
     contained therein.
       I am pleased to support your request to name members of the 
     Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to 
     consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of 
     letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor 
     consideration of the bill. I appreciate you cooperation 
     regarding this legislation.
           Sincerely,

                                                  Bruce Westerman,
                         Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.

  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Today, I rise in opposition to this bill, the so-called Fix Our 
Forests Act.
  This bill is anything but a fix for our forests, and it threatens to 
intensify not just the wildfire crisis but also the biodiversity and 
climate crises.
  We appreciate the focus and leadership that Chair Westerman has shown 
on these issues, and it is clear to me and so many others that our 
forests are a genuine passion of his. Unfortunately, this bill 
completely misses the mark and has the potential to do serious damage.
  Last Congress, Democrats delivered. We secured more than $15 billion 
in historic investments through the infrastructure law and the 
Inflation Reduction Act to help keep communities safe, restore healthy 
ecosystems, and promote healthy and sustainable forest management 
techniques.
  We provided resources for the Forest Service so they could treat a 
record-breaking number of acres without gutting environmental 
protections. We provided planning resources for at-risk communities. We 
provided more than $1 billion for staffing and resources in our 
permitting offices, funds that have already shortened project timelines 
by an average of 6 months. In addition, we supported better pay and 
benefits for wildland firefighters, an issue that I personally and 
consistently championed.

                              {time}  1430

  It is critical that our Federal land management agencies and their 
partners have the resources and staff capacity that is required to 
promote resilient forests and safe communities.
  It is shocking that most House Republicans voted against those two 
successful, popular laws: the Inflation Reduction Act and the 
bipartisan infrastructure law. It is also shocking that right at the 
moment when a lot of those investments are close to needing 
reauthorization, the majority is turning its back once again, and it is 
in stark contrast with the bill today.
  That is not for lack of trying on our side, but unfortunately, our 
Republican counterparts in the House Committee on Natural Resources 
have refused to work with committee Democrats on changes to the most 
egregious sections of this bill.
  I was optimistic at seeing several amendments filed by Democrats that 
highlight the missing pieces of this legislation. These included an 
effort to consider climate change in the bill, add authorizations for 
much-needed funding throughout an otherwise unfunded bill, and to rid 
this bill of the unprecedented and dangerous sections that strip 
Americans of access to the courts under the guise of litigation reform.
  Of course, these amendments were not ruled in order, supposedly due 
to Republican floor rules and procedure, rules and procedures that 
apparently apply only selectively because this bill has a slew of 
violations throughout, including numerous violations of the CutGo rules 
that are allegedly so important to the far-right Freedom Caucus.
  I hope those Freedom Caucus members know what they are being asked to 
vote for. What is in this bill that is so important that CutGo no 
longer applies? Well, the heart and soul of this bill is a longstanding 
Republican wish list of priorities that undermine science-based 
management decisions, bedrock environmental protections, and 
opportunities for community input.
  The so-called Fix Our Forests Act inappropriately stretches the 
credulity of

[[Page H5675]]

NEPA's emergency authorities. It undercuts the popular and bipartisan 
Endangered Species Act and even makes it more difficult for communities 
to challenge proposed projects in their own backyards.
  The climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis, and the safety of our 
communities all converge in our Nation's forests. Unfettered 
backcountry logging is not the answer. We need to support communities, 
not silence them.
  Do you know what else is not in this bill? Unlike the fire response 
laws that Democrats passed last Congress, there is nothing here about 
firefighter pay. What kind of fire response bill doesn't include pay 
for our firefighters in it? Are you kidding me?
  H.R. 8790 sets a dangerous precedent. The climate crisis is now. The 
wildfire crisis is now. We shouldn't be wasting our time on rushed 
bills with no real solutions.
  Many of the Republican initiatives here have already stalled in the 
2025 farm bill process. A better strategy to address the wildfire 
crisis would be to work across jurisdictional boundaries and with our 
Senate colleagues to find true consensus.
  We should be passing regular appropriation bills this week so that 
agencies like FEMA and the Forest Service have the resources they need 
and are not scrambling at the end of the fiscal year to find ways to 
fulfill their existing mandates, let alone the new and unfunded ones in 
this bill.
  This is a live issue, by the way. The chief of the Forest Service has 
warned us explicitly that they are facing budget shortfalls due to 
Republican-led appropriations bills. In fact, just on Friday, the 
Forest Service announced that it had to halt 2025 seasonal hires amid 
the budget crunch.
  We also need to work on providing relief and support for the 
communities that have been devastated by wildfire instead of trying to 
have Federal agencies undertake extensive management projects in their 
backyard without any true consent.
  We should be passing legislation that pays our Federal wildland 
firefighters and gives them the benefits that they deserve, another 
major priority that this bill fails to advance.
  The Forest Service is already stretched dangerously thin, and Federal 
firefighters are chronically underpaid. If we genuinely want to protect 
our communities and environment from devastating wildfires, we must 
prioritize people, ecosystems, and the economy. This bill fails to do 
each of those things.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, as I stated earlier, if forest health was about spending 
more money, then we would have the healthiest forests we have ever had, 
as my friends across the aisle interjected $12 billion into the Forest 
Service budget through the IRA and the IIJA, but their own goal of 
managing 6 million acres a year is going down--not going up but going 
down. It shows us that money is not the problem.
  On the subject of firefighter pay, I think we can agree that our 
firefighters need higher pay. That is why, in the appropriations bill 
on the Interior, we had an increase in firefighter pay. There was only 
one Democrat who voted for that bill on the House floor.
  Republicans have voted to increase the pay for firefighters, but 
again, it is not about money. If it was about money, then my colleagues 
would support this bill because the CBO has said this bill would 
actually save money. If we are not spending all this money fighting 
forest fires, we will be saving money coming out of the Treasury that 
we can spend on proactive things, like management.
  Again, it is about the policy. This is good policy. It is bipartisan 
policy. We have worked hard to try to make it that.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
Newhouse), the chairman of the Western Caucus.

  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Westerman for yielding me time 
to debate on this very important issue and bill.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Fix Our Forests Act. As chairman 
of the Congressional Western Caucus, I can tell you that wildfire risk 
remains top of mind as States across the West are ravaged by wildfires 
year after year.
  In fact, as we heard, just this year alone, over 7 million acres have 
burned due to out-of-control fires, and get this: Fire season is not 
over yet. We are already above our 10-year average of acres affected, 
with fires burning larger and hotter than ever before.
  We need proactive forest management now, and the Fix Our Forests Act 
will help us achieve that goal. This bipartisan effort will enable 
desperately needed active forest management by expediting permitting 
reviews and limiting senseless lawsuits from extreme environmentalists.
  With more proactive forest management, we can prevent the risk of 
fires raging out of control and save our communities from devastating 
damage.
  Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) for 
his leadership on this legislation. I am very proud to support this 
victory for rural Western America.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, bad process leads to bad policy. Unfortunately, the 
process for this bill has been a chaotic mess from the start.
  We never had a hearing on an introduced bill, just the discussion 
draft, and that is despite, or maybe because of, the longstanding 
administration policy of not spending limited time and resources 
testifying on draft bills.
  We raced to markup without testimony from the Department of the 
Interior. The administration nevertheless went above and beyond and 
provided extensive technical assistance and edits from both the 
Department of the Interior and the Forest Service.
  I am not talking about policy differences here. I am talking about 
serious concerns with the bill not making sense. Unfortunately, the 
sponsor ignored those red flags.
  Let me give you an example. The bill sets a timeline based on when a 
categorical exclusion is published in the Federal Register. I would 
like to make a point that was brought to our attention by the Forest 
Service itself: Categorical exclusions are not published in the Federal 
Register.
  That is how sloppy the drafting is in this bill, and the process 
defects have continued.
  This bill has numerous violations of the Freedom Caucus' floor 
protocols requiring offsets for authorized spending. I guess the CutGo 
protocols are out the window now.
  It is convenient that, as of this morning, we still don't have a 
score from the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, on the bill. Maybe 
the Freedom Caucus just isn't aware of the problem.
  The cherry on top? Republicans accidentally made in order an 
amendment drafted so badly that it would strike out the bill entirely 
and replace it with a noncontroversial bill that Democrats support. 
Republicans had to come to Democrats this morning to ask for our help 
in fixing that mistake.
  I will end where it started: Bad process leads to bad policy.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
Lee).
  Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Chair, I am not sure how familiar everyone is 
with the committee proceedings on this legislation, but just in case, I 
want to offer a little refresher.
  This is not the first time that I have spoken out on the majority's 
either inability or outright refusal to do what is right by our 
Nation's firefighters.
  In August 2023, my friend and colleague, Representative   Joe Neguse, 
who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands, 
introduced the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act of 2023. 
This bipartisan legislation would permanently fix the pay cliff that 
our firefighters, our hometown heroes who are actually out there fixing 
our forests, are facing at the end of this week.
  We have known about this pay cliff for well over a year, but here we 
are, nearing the end of 2024, and the majority has still failed to 
enact a permanent fix. There is certainly not one in this bill, the Fix 
Our Forests Act.
  Right now, the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act of 2023 
has over two dozen champions on both sides of the aisle, evenly divided 
by Democrats and Republicans, myself included. Yet, all we have to 
show for this is yet another temporary fix in this week's CR, with 
Republican leadership once again stringing along these

[[Page H5676]]

men and women in uniform for another few months without a permanent 
solution.

  As appropriators on both sides of the aisle have emphasized, these 
temporary patches end up costing taxpayers more than simply locking in 
a permanent pay fix. Strangely, this all comes after the House 
Republicans actually did vote for a permanent fix, as the chairman has 
stated.
  Let me clear this up: It was part of the fiscal year 2025 Interior 
appropriations bill, which stands no chance of making it to the 
President's desk because of the majority's insistence on including over 
80 poison pill policy riders to appease partisan extremists. If they 
were serious, they would have dropped these partisan riders.
  Now, in spite of the bipartisan support for both the Wildland 
Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act and my own amendment to this bill 
to achieve the same goal, the majority is now claiming that that 
permanent pay fix is somehow not germane to the Fix Our Forests Act.
  I ask, again, who exactly are the people on the front lines doing the 
work of fixing our forests? Answer: Our wildland firefighters.
  Men and women are being paid less than a living wage in one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world to literally jump out of planes and 
contain fires before they burn down our homes and businesses.
  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada.
  Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Chair, instead, we are going to slap a Band-
Aid on this and revisit the pay issue after another congressional 
recess, which just got longer.
  Meanwhile, these firefighters will hold their breath for another 
torturous 3 months, or even worse, they will get fed up and walk off 
the job, and our country will be less safe as a result.
  What is happening is not just wrong, but it is nonsensical. We have 
firefighters risking their lives, needing a fix, with Republicans and 
Democrats both supporting a fix. Either a standalone bill or an 
amendment to this bill would provide that permanent fix, yet we don't 
have one. No more excuses.

                              {time}  1445

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, you know, I hate to spend time in debate 
laying out how the procedures of the House work, but, number one, the 
majority doesn't determine what is germane. The Parliamentarian 
determines what is germane.
  Number two, wildland firefighters actually support our bill. We gave 
our friends across the aisle an opportunity to vote for a pay increase 
for wildland firefighters that is in an appropriations bill. This is an 
authorization bill. It is not an appropriations bill. They chose to 
vote against the increased pay in the appropriations bill, but again, 
we are working on an authorization bill, and it does meet House floor 
protocol.
  There is not a CutGo because we are not cutting. Actually, the only 
thing we are cutting are expenses to the Federal Government.
  I just wanted to clarify those few things.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Duarte).
  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Westerman for yielding, and I 
rise in support of the Fix Our Forests Act.
  As someone who farms on the edge of the forest in California, I can 
tell you, bad policies coming out of Washington and Sacramento, 
exacerbated by frivolous litigation, have led to failed outcomes in 
Federal forest management. There is no doubt about it: This is 
abandonment of one of our natural resources.
  As we see with government-imposed droughts in California, laws and 
regulations are being twisted to block forest management and timber 
harvesting in our national forests, which peaked in the 1980s, but 
steadily declined and have not recovered. This has been exacerbated by 
the designation of over 111 million acres of preservation wilderness 
areas that severely limit access, ban timber harvests, and make even 
firefighting difficult in our forests.
  This resource abandonment is also hurting our communities. Countless 
jobs are lost, and insurance companies are seeking to cancel policies 
and refusing to even provide fire insurance coverage in areas of 
California because of the risk of out-of-control forest fires.
  These fires also devalue our national forest habitat and watersheds.
  For example, we are now learning that some of these fires burn so hot 
that they may be changing the soil chemistry to create cancer-causing 
hexavalent chromium. That is the Erin Brockovich compound. This raises 
serious concerns about the toxic chemical getting into our groundwater 
when runoff from burn areas occurs.
  That raises another serious concern: sedimentation of our rivers. 
When our forests burn, debris washes off the Sierra Nevadas and settles 
into our waterways, silting up our rivers, streams, and reservoirs and 
hurts fish species. This increases flood risks and decreases our 
ability to store water.
  These fires also release millions of tons of pollution into the air 
that we breathe that can cause respiratory issues.
  This resource abandonment is hurting Californians, which is 
unacceptable, and that is why I am proud to support the Fix Our Forests 
Act.
  This commonsense legislation will make necessary reforms to expedite 
forest management projects and reduce frivolous lawsuits designed to 
slow or block action. This bill will help protect our forests, the 
environment, and will create jobs, and I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Peters).
  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, this year, wildfires have already burned over 
7 million acres of forests and over 1,000 homes and other structures. 
Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate, often 
with just minutes to pack their most important belongings, not knowing 
if they will ever return to their homes.
  Many have done all the right things to protect their property, but 
because of the magnitude of the wildfire crisis, they cannot get 
insurance for their homes. Every day of fire season feels like they are 
gambling with everything they own.
  After decades of mismanagement and misguided fire suppression 
tactics, there is now a scientific consensus on the solution: active 
forest management, State, local, Federal, and Tribal collaboration; and 
continued research and development on next-generation technologies and 
solutions.
  The problem is that forest management projects like clearing dead 
trees and dry vegetation that fuel fires often require multiyear 
environmental reviews followed by years of litigation in many cases. 
While we wait for analysis, forests burn down, air pollution worsens, 
and the threats posed by climate change to our local communities are 
exacerbated.
  Places like Jimtown, Montana, know the consequences of inaction, 
where the Forest Service proposed treating at-risk land near people's 
homes. They conducted a comprehensive environmental review, and they 
gained community support. Then an outside group decided that they knew 
better than the experts and the Forest Service and the residents, and 
they sued. They claimed the NEPA analysis did not do enough to study 
the impact on a particular bird of prey, the goshawk--not that they 
didn't study it, but they didn't study it enough. Locals pleaded with 
the group to drop that lawsuit, but the group decided to go through 
with the appeal anyway.
  A hearing was set for October of 2003, but unfortunately, in July of 
2003, the exact type of fire the Forest Service warned about burned 
down that forest. The fire caused evacuations, took out power to a 
nearby community, and cost over $1 million to suppress.
  When the case was finally heard 2 years later, the Ninth Circuit 
ruled in the Forest Service's favor and found the reviews were 
sufficient.
  That is the problem. The community and its needs were ignored. The 
community wasn't helped. It was ignored. Lives, homes, and businesses 
were all needlessly put in harm's way. The goshawks' habitat was 
destroyed.

  The Fix Our Forests Act that I cosponsored with Mr. Westerman is a

[[Page H5677]]

comprehensive bill to simplify and expedite the most critical forest 
management projects while maintaining strong environmental standards.
  It will reduce the threat of litigation that delays these projects, 
and it adds new opportunities for communities to engage early in the 
process. It also creates new programs to protect homes and communities 
from fires and makes it easier for them to access Federal assistance.
  This is a bipartisan bill with cosponsors from both sides of the 
aisle, and it passed out of the committee by a voice vote. It is 
endorsed by the wildland firefighters, who we all agree, it seems to 
me, deserve a raise, and we should make that happen.
  I worked with groups like The Nature Conservancy and the 
Environmental Defense Fund, and others to write this bill. The Nature 
Conservancy has decided to stay neutral on the bill because of one 
provision they find problematic. To Chair Westerman's credit, he 
accepted The Nature Conservancy's other edits. The Nature Conservancy 
has the luxury of staying neutral as an outside group, but we all need 
in this body to decide where we stand.
  I have spoken with colleagues on my side of the aisle, Democrats, who 
tell me that they will oppose the bill, although they agree with 18 out 
of 22 things in the text. Compromise is about accepting the 4 things 
you don't like so you can get the 18 things you do like. Mr. Westerman 
has worked with me and other Democratic offices to adopt Democratic 
amendments to improve the legislation.
  We don't have the time to wait for perfect. Every day we wait, more 
land burns down. Let's get this bill passed and provide some hope for 
Americans.
  Mr. Chair, this Fix Our Forests Act establishes a national Fireshed 
Center as the central information hub of our wildfire strategy.
  I introduced an amendment with Representative Harder to clarify the 
center's role, which was not made in order due to a misunderstanding 
about germaneness. Our amendment would have clarified the purposes of 
the center, provided it with specific direction for its implementation, 
and provided safeguards for the protection of sensitive propriety 
information, while ensuring representation from non-Federal entities.
  I look forward to working with the gentleman, Mr. Westerman, in 
conference to get these changes made.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Again, I sincerely thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) 
for his remarks and for his partnership on this legislation. As he 
mentioned, due to some procedural issues, we were not able to consider 
an amendment he was offering to make improvements to the bill's 
Fireshed Center. This is an effort that I support, and I regret we were 
unable to get this amendment made in order.
  I do look forward to working with the gentleman on incorporating the 
amendment in the future discussions with the Senate.
  I also thank Matt Weiner and the entire team at Megafire Action for 
working with us tirelessly on this important amendment and for their 
support of this bipartisan legislation.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Tiffany), the subcommittee chair on Federal Lands.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Chairman 
Westerman's bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act.
  This bill is the culmination of the House Committee on Natural 
Resources' efforts this Congress to advance innovative solutions to 
increase the pace and scale of forest management, protect vulnerable 
communities from catastrophic wildfires, and restore health and 
resiliency to our Nation's ailing forests and Federal lands.
  Addressing the health of our forests and rangelands is not an issue 
that will be solved by simply throwing more dollars at it. We need 
substantive changes in our land management practices.
  Undermining active forest management has caused damage to our 
Nation's forests and Federal lands, and we have seen the consequences 
of this mismanagement out West, resulting in year after year of bad 
wildfire seasons.
  We can act right now to reverse this trend, and that starts with 
passing this bill.
  This bill contains streamlined tools to expedite bureaucratic 
environmental reviews, ending frivolous litigation that delays 
important projects, expanding Good Neighbor Authority, prioritizing 
high-risk forests, and a fix to the Cottonwood decision, which is 
responsible for doubling the cost of some projects.
  It also includes my bill, the ACRES Act, which requires land managers 
to produce yearly hazardous fuels reduction reports based on the actual 
number of acres that they treated, and I will note that this proposal 
already passed the House with robust bipartisan support.
  The provisions included in this bill will lead to better management, 
which in turn, will result in better outcomes for our land managers and 
our local communities with fewer wildfires and a cleaner environment.
  To one of the comments, Mr. Chair, that was shared previously about 
the firefighter problem we have and the danger they are being put in, 
the number one thing we can do to protect firefighters' health and life 
is to manage our forests.
  Take a look at this chart here to my right where you see forest 
management. The amount of wood that is being harvested, all from our 
Federal forests, steadily declined since the 1980s.
  What happened with wildfires? They increased significantly. There is 
a direct correlation. Manage our forests, take timber off from it, and 
we will not have these wildfires as we have seen since 1988.
  I thank the chairman, Mr. Westerman, for his tireless work on this in 
the Natural Resources Committee, which I sit on, and I urge passage of 
this bill.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I thank the gentleman for his leadership on the subcommittee and for 
his work going into this bill to make the bill better and to add some 
of the things that he mentioned.
  When we talk about taking timber off of the forests, we are not 
talking about clear-cutting. It always gets misconstrued that we want 
to clear-cut the forests. I challenge anyone to show me where the U.S. 
Forest Service is clear-cutting because you won't find that. I have 
asked them: Is there any place you still clear-cut? And they said: No.
  What we are talking about is forest management, where we go in and we 
thin out, we create growing space, we allow these trees to be 
healthier, more vibrant. We allow them to have access to sunlight, 
access to soil moisture and nutrients, and it gives them an opportunity 
to grow. It also creates space when the fire comes through it can drop 
down to the forest floor where it can easily be put out if it needs to 
be put out.
  Some fire is beneficial to the forest, but certainly not fire that 
gets up in the crown of the trees and destroys everything in its path.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I want to briefly address a claim that we 
heard earlier that this bill was written by The Nature Conservancy or 
written with them. I am sure that that would come as a surprise to the 
bill's author, Chairman Westerman, but moreover, we have checked with 
the group, and not only did they not write it, The Nature Conservancy 
says they have not even endorsed this bill.
  I just want to clear that up for everyone.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
Kamlager-Dove).
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
8790, the Fix Our Forests Act.
  This bill had real potential, potential that could have been realized 
if committee Democrats had been meaningfully involved in its 
development.
  Wildfires are a crisis that demands our collective attention across 
party lines. We have seen firsthand how it devastates communities, 
including in southern California where the Post fire continues to burn 
in the rugged hills of East L.A.
  Hot, dry, and windy conditions intensified by the climate crisis are 
fueling more frequent and severe wildfires. These fires are spreading 
faster, lasting longer, and growing more intense.

[[Page H5678]]

  Let me be clear: While this may seem like the new normal, it is 
anything but. The wildfire crisis is linked directly to the climate 
crisis, and if we are serious about protecting our communities, we must 
tackle both head-on.
  That means reducing emissions and committing to a clean, renewable 
economy, something that, sadly, this Congress under Republican 
leadership refuses to address.

                              {time}  1500

  We must also ensure that our Federal land management agencies have 
the resources, personnel, and tools to promote resilient forests and 
safe communities.
  That is why House Democrats took bold action in the last Congress.
  Through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we secured $28 
billion for the Department of the Interior and $5.5 million for the 
Forest Service to address wildfire management and resilience.
  Let's not forget: every single Natural Resources Committee Republican 
voted ``no.'' Then came the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided an 
additional $2.5 billion for ecosystem resilience and $500 million for 
wildfire workforce needs. Once again, Republicans opposed these 
critical investments.
  Thanks to these historic actions, the Biden-Harris administration has 
made significant progress. The national wildfire strategy is delivering 
record-breaking restoration efforts to strengthen our landscapes and 
keep communities safe.
  We also established the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management 
Commission, which released 148 consensus recommendations. I am pleased 
to see that the Fix Our Forests Act incorporates several of these 
recommendations.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. In fact, Mr. Chair, we support 18 of the 22 
sections of the bill. However, without additional changes, the bill 
includes harmful provisions that go beyond what the wildfire commission 
recommended.
  Despite 148 opportunities for consensus, my colleagues across the 
aisle couldn't resist undermining our bedrock environmental protections 
like NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic 
Preservation Act.
  This is unnecessary because the evidence is clear: the Forest Service 
has achieved record-breaking results in reducing wildfire risks, thanks 
to the investments Democrats made last Congress over Republican 
opposition.
  Instead of weakening vital environmental laws, we should focus on 
building on the progress we have already made.
  The wildfire crisis is, and should be, a bipartisan priority. 
Democrats stand ready to work together on consensus-based solutions 
that provide our land management agencies with the tools they need. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 8790 is not that solution.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, if the minority truly were concerned about carbon in the 
atmosphere, their number one priority would be to keep forests healthy, 
to keep massive amounts of carbon dioxide from going up in wildfires, 
and to keep dead and decaying wood from being digested by 
microorganisms and being released as methane into the atmosphere.
  If we want to make less carbon in the atmosphere and if we want to 
keep it in the trees, then we should utilize the greatest carbon 
capture and sequestration device ever known to man, and that is a tree. 
It is on a wide scale a low-cost and economical way to capture and 
sequester carbon. However, when we let our forests become subject to 
bug and infestation attacks and to catastrophic wildfire, then we are 
going in the opposite direction.
  If somebody wants to make the argument that we need healthy forests 
for a better climate, then they should vote for this bill because that 
is what this bill would do.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
Bentz).
  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chair Westerman for the work he has 
done in creating the Fix Our Forests Act.
  The path to solving any problem starts with an understanding of 
scale. The Western United States has millions upon millions of acres of 
trees, over 85 million acres of forests on the West Coast alone. In my 
State of Oregon, there are 30 million acres; Washington, 22.5 million; 
and California, 33 million. There are 85 million acres of forest, 
132,000 square miles, an area bigger than New Mexico.
  Now, it is not a problem to have forests. When they are managed well, 
they are an incredible, essential, and an irreplaceable asset. However, 
our forests are growing faster and faster, building up huge amounts of 
potential energy which, without any doubt whatsoever, will burn as 
things are currently situated.
  Fires are perhaps started by an arsonist, a lightning bolt, or the 
negligence of a camper. When this happens, the overgrown and dry 
forests will burn like paper. If there is even a moderate wind, these 
fires spread just like wildfire because they are burning up and 
destroying land, animals, structures, homes, and even people.
  Just this year in Oregon, in my home State, almost 2 million acres 
burned. A huge amount of these 2 million acres was forestland. The 
Forest Service says that about 250 million of our tax dollars were 
spent fighting these fires. At least 32 homes were destroyed. That is 
in addition to hundreds of homes that have been lost in previous fires.
  The value of timber burned up on private ground, 330,000 acres, 
caught up in this year's fires, just in Oregon, is in the tens of 
millions of dollars.
  Because of forest fire risk, the cost of fire insurance on thousands 
of homes across Oregon is skyrocketing and in some cases is not even 
available.
  The amount of CO<inf>2</inf>, smoke, ash, dust, and permanent 
environmental harm is enormous. The old-growth timber burned up and 
forever lost is unforgivable. This is just a sample of what has 
happened in Oregon.
  The same thing on an even greater and more damaging scale happened in 
California this year, Washington, Montana, and so on.
  The causes of overgrown and dry forests burning up are many, but one 
of the obvious things we should be doing, and something that all 
rational people agree upon, is to reduce the amount of fuel in our 
forests, to actually go in and remove woody material from these 85 
million acres that are not essential to the forest.

  So why isn't this happening?
  Why are we dragging our feet when it comes to getting brush and 
understory of small trees out of our forests?
  Why are we failing to clean up our forests and protecting them?
  Of course, the reason is our laws and the haystack of regulations 
that get in the way. They create delays, they create roadblocks, they 
create litigation paralysis, and they create endless bureaucratic 
efforts to write the perfect management plan. It is this set of 
problems and obstacles that the Fix Our Forests Act, brought to us 
today by Chair Westerman, would help significantly resolve.
  The summary of the Fix Our Forests Act calls out the fact that we 
would be simplifying the approach to this, and that would be an 
excellent idea, revitalizing our rural economies, and renewing and 
prioritizing our science. All of these are excellent things.
  I just want to say that when I was young, living on a ranch in 
eastern Oregon on the border of the Malheur National Forest, a fire in 
our forest was rare. In fact, in the 15 years I lived in that beautiful 
place, I remember only one forest fire in that forest. Now horrific 
fires are an annual and all too predictable occurrence. These are not 
small fires. These are terrible, destructive, and awful fires.
  Just this summer, I received a call from a terrified constituent 
begging me to call airplanes with fire retardant to save their home. It 
is a miracle that only one person, and that was bad enough, was killed 
this year in fighting these fires. Next year we may be not so lucky.
  Let's pass this bill so we can get into the forests now, not years 
from now, reduce fuel loads and make our communities and our people 
safer and our forests more resilient.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Panetta), who is a cosponsor of the bill and has been a 
tireless advocate on improving forest health.

[[Page H5679]]

  

  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I appreciate this opportunity. I think we 
have seen why we are here today. It is because in the past decade, 
America has witnessed firsthand the devastation, the death, and the 
massive destruction from wildfires.
  In my home State of California, this year alone, wildfires have 
burned almost 1 million acres. That is just one-fourth of the acres 
that burned back in 2020.
  In my congressional district along the coast of California, we have 
endured some of the most extreme wildfires in our Nation's history in 
the Los Padres National Forest, Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Big Sur 
coastline.
  Now, unfortunately, 80 percent of wildfires are caused by humans. 
What really makes us vulnerable to these extreme fires in this time of 
extreme weather and, yes, in this time of extreme climate change, is 
that we are doing what we can to fight the fires, but we just aren't 
doing enough to prevent the fires.
  Decades of dereliction when it comes to doing anything to manage 
wildlands is a persistent cause of why the Western United States is so 
susceptible to the devastating conflagrations we are experiencing.
  That is why we need to do something, anything, when it comes to the 
management of our forests and to be proactive when it comes to 
protecting our wetlands and the lives and livelihoods of those who live 
in the wildland-urban interface.
  The Fix Our Forests Act is a big step in the right direction to 
restore the health of forests, to bolster their resiliency, and, yes, 
to reduce the threat of wildfires.
  This legislation would allow all levels of government to play their 
part with community wildfire risk reduction programs, a national 
Fireshed Center, and, yes, to fix our flawed permitting system, not by 
getting rid of NEPA but with the flexibility necessary so that those on 
the ground can implement prevention projects, manage our forests, and 
therefore protect our forests.
  Another key part of this legislation would also expand and encourage 
the use of prescribed burns in fireshed areas that would not only help 
prevent fires, it would help my congressional district keep on track 
with our management plan.
  As wildfire seasons have turned into wildfire years, we have learned 
our lesson and have done an excellent job fighting fires, but now it is 
time we must do something to prevent wildfires.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, or 
NEPA, and litigation are not the reason that we have catastrophic 
wildfires. In fact, a 2020 study showed that only one out of every 450 
NEPA reviews are ever challenged in court.
  Plus, the Forest Service already conducts over 85 percent of its work 
through existing categorical exclusions, which allows proceeding 
without a NEPA environmental assessment or an environmental impact 
statement.
  The reality is that the Forest Service has a wide range of tools and 
policies designed to expedite the forest management projects.
  Here is the actual problem: The Forest Service is chronically 
underfunded. Gaps in funding are directly tied to project delays and 
management challenges across the agency. A review conducted by the 
``Columbia Journal of Environmental Law'' found that many sources of 
delay attributed to NEPA are caused by external factors, and they point 
to inadequate staffing, insufficient funding, and delays of obtaining 
information from permittees.
  The Forest Service doesn't need us to roll back our environmental 
laws. It needs sustainable funding and additional staff capacity.
  However, the Republicans who keep voting against that funding would 
rather scapegoat our environmental laws and the public's right to 
access the courthouse.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, it was insinuated earlier that my good friend, Mr. Peters, 
did not work with The Nature Conservancy.
  It begins by saying that: ``TNC, which has decades of experience in 
wildfire mitigation and resilience work, was at the table with 
Representatives Peters and Westerman to improve this bill from its 
initial draft form.''
  They go on to say that they are not endorsing the bill because of 
some issues they have, but they also list several things that they 
approve of in the bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the Nature Conservancy statement.

                           TNC New Statement

       TNC's position: TNC, which has decades of experience in 
     wildfire mitigation and resilience work, was at the table 
     with Reps. Peters and Westerman to improve this bill from its 
     initial draft form, and while it has certainly improved since 
     that point due in part to our advocacy, we are not endorsing 
     the bill due to a remaining problematic provision in the 
     litigation reform section that TNC believes could damagingly 
     limit community engagement.
       However, we also believe there are beneficial provisions in 
     the bill, such as the Good Neighbor Authority provisions, the 
     inclusion of Tribal priorities in the fireshed management 
     section, the Community Wildfire Risk Reduction Program, and 
     the Seeds of Success cross agency coordination.

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Kim).
  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Westerman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8790, the Fix Our Forests 
Act.
  The fear facing many of my constituents during California's peak 
wildfire season, especially in the canyon communities close to the 
Cleveland National Forest, became a reality in recent weeks as multiple 
wildfires burn simultaneously in southern California, including the 
Airport fire in my district.
  The Airport fire has burned over 23,500 acres, and still counting, in 
Orange and Riverside Counties.
  I am grateful to the first responders who are working day and night 
to keep our communities safe. Times like these also show us that first 
responders need all tools available to protect our communities and 
respond to the ever-changing threat that wildfires pose.
  The Fix Our Forests Act includes legislation that I introduced called 
the Wildfire Technology Demonstration, Evaluation, Modernization, and 
Optimization, or DEMO, Act, that would address this need.
  I introduced the DEMO Act after hearing from firefighting agencies 
and companies developing innovative technologies.
  This bipartisan legislation aims to deploy more emerging technologies 
to fight wildfires by allowing private entities to partner with Federal 
land management agencies to test wildfire technologies in a 7-year 
pilot program.
  This is a win-win for private entities looking to test their 
technologies at scale and Federal land management agencies working to 
deploy emerging technologies to help combat wildfires.
  I thank my friend, Representative Crow, for his partnership on the 
DEMO Act, as well as Chairman Westerman and Representative Peters for 
including my legislation in this important and timely bill to keep our 
communities and forests safe from wildfires.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 8790.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her efforts 
in helping make this a better bill. She knows all too well the 
devastation of catastrophic wildfires like what are happening in her 
district.
  Mr. Chair, I have no further requests for time, I am prepared to 
close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 8 minutes 
remaining.

                              {time}  1515

  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, we need to clear up the record about this idea that the 
Forest Service supports expanded categorical exclusions, often called 
CEs.
  The Fix Our Forests Act would massively expand categorical exclusions 
for fireshed management projects, including activities like logging and 
pesticide application, which would have significant impacts on forest 
ecosystems.
  Typically, categorical exclusions are developed by the agencies with 
the

[[Page H5680]]

input of experts. They are detailed and specific with appropriate 
guardrails that prevent unnecessary harm, and they are a useful tool. 
In fact, 82 percent of Forest Service projects are executed using 
categorical exclusions.
  The so-called Fix Our Forests Act takes a sledgehammer to that track 
record. The Forest Service has said that they would use any new 
authorities Congress grants to them, but they are not advocating for 
any larger categorical exclusions.
  We are not here to try and stop the Forest Service from using the 
tools that it has. What we are trying to do is avoid complicating the 
processes that the Forest Service has, and that is a real issue.
  The Forest Service has explicitly told us in technical assistance 
that this bill's directives around the creation and implementation of 
fireshed management projects are duplicative and confusing. Why aren't 
we listening to them?
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Chair, I know that conversations about wildfire can be very 
difficult for Members on both sides. The fires this year and in recent 
years have been devastating, and I have seen it firsthand with 
wildfires in my district.
  I close with the same message that I started with: Republican 
leadership is using the very real and painful wildfire crisis as a 
Trojan horse for a longstanding wish list of harmful environmental 
policies. Our forests are critical carbon reserves, majestic 
destinations for outdoor recreation, and habitats for a range of 
wildlife, including many threatened and endangered species. All of that 
will be put at risk by this bill's overzealous approach to logging and 
other destructive management practices.
  This bill codifies and expands the use of emergency authorities 
dramatically, bending the protections provided by the successful, 
popular, and iconic laws, such as the Endangered Species Act and NEPA. 
There is nothing discrete or cute about opening this many acres to 
management without proper review.
  Mr. Chair, confronting the wildfire crisis is hard work that requires 
smart planning and broad collaboration. We won't get there through 
shortcuts and rollbacks.
  Relying on rushed planning for routine forest management undermines 
community involvement. We shouldn't be undercutting the people who are 
most at risk.
  The Forest Service has been asking us to help them with consistent, 
reliable budgets. They have been warning us that the appropriations 
numbers from our Republican colleagues are causing extreme budget 
shortfalls. They announced just last week that the Forest Service 
cannot afford to hire nonfire temporary staff anymore.
  Let me repeat that: The Republican inability to fund the government 
on time and with sufficient resources has caused the Forest Service to 
place a freeze on hiring the very staff who hike into the backcountry 
to maintain the trails that so many of us use and love.
  Finally, this bill fails to provide a permanent and much-needed fix 
for wildland firefighter pay. That should be one of our top priorities 
when it comes to confronting the wildfire crisis. Yet, it is completely 
sidestepped by this legislation.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Chair, what we are doing is not working. Our forests are not 
getting healthier. Our environment is not getting better. The climate 
is not getting better. Wildlife habitats are not getting better. Water 
quality is not getting better. It is all getting worse from the things 
that we have been doing the last 30 years.
  If that is not enough evidence to say it is time for a change, I 
don't know what is. The time to fix our forests is now. This is a good, 
commonsense, bipartisan bill for our forest health and our Nation's 
benefit. The Fix Our Forests Act will end the status quo of overgrown, 
fire-prone tinderboxes.
  Mr. Chair, again, this bill will make our forests healthier and more 
resilient. It will protect our communities, save taxpayer money, and 
cut red tape. I urge the adoption of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on Natural Resources, printed in the bill, modified by the

     additional actions as may be necessary to redress any legal 
     wrong suffered by, or adverse effect on, the plaintiff,

     (a) shall be void with respect to such plan and a court of 
     proper jurisdiction may order completion of the plan on an 
     accelerated basis.
       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to 
     the relevant Congressional Committees summarizing the 
     implementation of this section.

  The Acting CHAIR. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall 
be in order except those printed in part D of House Report 118-705.

for division of the question.


                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Molinaro

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 21, line 10, strike ``and''.
       Page 21, line 14, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.
       Page 21, after line 14, insert the following:
       (v) a strategy for reducing the threat of wildfire to 
     improve the effectiveness of wildland firefighting, 
     particularly the effectiveness of fuels treatments that would 
     improve wildland firefighter safety during wildfires;

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Molinaro) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support and speak briefly 
on my amendment, which seeks to highlight the importance of protecting 
our wildland firefighters by considering strategies to mitigate health 
risks to them.
  As we witness the increasing devastation caused by wildfires across 
our country, we cannot and should not overlook the heroic efforts of 
those brave men and women who fight them. They risk their lives on the 
front lines, protect their communities and natural landscapes, facing 
extreme danger in unpredictable environments, and often working long 
hours in extremely hazardous conditions.
  Unfortunately, though, there are times that their protection and 
well-being can be seen as an afterthought. I extend my appreciation to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. Harder) for his work on this 
amendment. Our bipartisan amendment seeks to consider strategies that 
would enhance wildland firefighter safety in the fireshed assessment.
  Providing Federal assistance to States to augment these plans will 
only reduce wildfire exposure risks. As a member of my own local fire 
department, I too understand the great sacrifice that too many 
certainly make on our behalf. Addressing firefighter safety is not 
something we can do in isolation. It requires cooperation from all 
levels of government.
  Our amendment is just one step forward. We need to continue to push 
for bipartisan solutions that prioritize the safety of wildland 
firefighters, and this is a fight that transcends, of course, party 
lines because the lives of those brave men and women who fight the 
fires and their safety are at stake.
  I express my appreciation to Chairman Westerman and Representative 
Harder for their work on this bill.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in 
opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I am not opposed to this amendment.
  I congratulate my colleague, Representative Harder, for getting it 
made in order for consideration today, but I do want to take this 
opportunity to comment on the overall process we have seen on the 
underlying bill.
  This amendment is an example of the sort of thing we could have 
figured out months ago if Republican leaders had not insisted on such a 
rushed, chaotic process for this bill.
  The hearing was on a discussion draft, which meant that it happened 
without testimony from one of the affected Federal departments. Then my 
Republican colleagues ignored extensive technical assistance and red 
flags provided by the Department of the Interior and by the Forest 
Service.
  I emphasize again: I am not even talking about policy differences 
here. I am talking about serious concerns that the bill doesn't make 
sense.
  Unfortunately, the sponsor ignored those red flags. Throughout the 
process, committee Democrats have asked to be included so that we could 
try to reach consensus on this bill.
  We could have made suggestions, such as this amendment before us. We 
could have offered improvements to address the administration's 
concerns, but we were excluded. Now we are here with a bill that 
doesn't comply with the Republican Conference's own CutGo protocols and 
that, as of this morning, didn't even have a CBO score.
  Finally, for anyone who missed this earlier, Republicans accidentally 
made in order an amendment drafted so badly that it would strike the 
bill entirely and replace it with a noncontroversial bill that 
Democrats support. That sounded good to me, but Republicans had to come 
to us this morning to ask for our help in fixing that mistake.
  Here is the bottom line: I am not opposed to this amendment, but, 
unfortunately, it won't be enough to make a bad bill, created through a 
bad process, into a good one. Maybe we could have gotten there with an 
inclusive process, but that is not the path my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle chose, and that is where we are today.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's support for 
our amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan 
amendment offered by my colleague from New York (Mr. Molinaro), and the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Harder).
  This amendment ensures that each fireshed assessment required by the 
bill also includes consideration of a strategy to reduce the threat 
that wildfires pose to wildfire firefighters' health and safety.
  Specifically, the amendment requires that fireshed assessments 
analyze the effectiveness of fuel treatments that would improve both 
the efficacy of wildland firefighting and the safety of wildland 
firefighters.
  Fireshed assessments are a strategic tool for gauging or reducing the 
risk of wildfire in high-risk areas. By targeting treatments in the 
right areas, we can protect communities and put firefighters into 
winnable situations where they can effectively battle wildfires.
  This amendment focuses on a crucial dimension of the wildfire crisis; 
namely, the safety of the brave men and women who regularly put 
themselves in danger to combat raging wildfires.
  The amendment correctly identifies fuel treatments as a meaningful 
way to accomplish this goal, as proactively treated areas can slow the 
advancing wildfires and give firefighters precious time to safely 
combat an approaching blaze.

  Mr. Chair, I appreciate the bipartisan collaboration reflected in 
this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.

[[Page H5689]]

  Mr. LaMalfa. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       After section 116 insert the following:

     SEC. 117. UTILIZING GRAZING FOR WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION.

       The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of 
     the Forest Service, in coordination with holders of permits 
     to graze livestock on Federal land, shall develop a strategy 
     to increase opportunities to utilize livestock grazing as a 
     wildfire risk reduction strategy, including--
       (1) completion of reviews (as required under the National 
     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)) to 
     allow permitted grazing on vacant grazing allotments during 
     instances of drought, wildfire, or other natural disasters 
     that disrupt grazing on allotments already permitted;
       (2) use of targeted grazing;
       (3) increased use of temporary permits to promote targeted 
     fuels reduction and reduction of invasive annual grasses;
       (4) increased use of grazing as a postfire recovery and 
     restoration strategy, where appropriate; and
       (5) use of all applicable authorities under the law.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, for my colleague from California (Ms. 
Porter), I have an amendment that should raise the balance to loving 
this bill.
  Mr. Chair, as part of the Fix Our Forests Act, I have been able to 
add my amendment, which is contained in H.R. 7666. It directs the 
Forest Service to expand the use of utilizing targeted animal grazing 
in fuels management programs to reduce wildfire risk.
  It will make the use of grazing to reduce fine fuels found in forest 
floors and the meadows near them, which make fires burn hotter, faster, 
and more dangerously. Utilizing livestock for fire fuel management is 
common sense, and it has been practiced for many years. It is being 
curtailed by more and more difficult permitting processes in more 
recent years.
  It is a very important tool that, unfortunately, is not being 
utilized enough, whether it is cattle on the vast plains and areas 
around our forested areas, sheep, or, as we have seen success, even in 
urban areas, people hiring goatherds to come in and clean those 
difficult areas that are hard for people themselves to get in, such as 
along riverbanks and places like that.

                              {time}  1530

  We know this tool works well in order to curb that flammable 
material.
  The West continues to face a wildfire and a forest health crisis. In 
California, as we have listed out here today, we have seen many 
firsthand instances of fire that are just unbelievably large and 
devastating. It is even more increasing in later fire seasons here.
  I can talk about my district itself and the catastrophic damage we 
have had. The Camp fire in Paradise was over 100,000 acres, but key to 
that argument is the loss of 85 lives in that devastating fire. The 
North Complex, my colleague from Arkansas mentioned earlier, has 
consumed portions of Forbestown and Berry Creek, and it was over 
318,000 acres. Then, we had, later on, the million-acre Dixie fire. 
Most recently, the Park fire, which started in a park near Chico, ended 
up consuming right under 430,000 acres.
  These are all six- and seven-digit numbers that have burned right in 
my backyard, in just one district, and over 2 million acres in just a 
few short years, with the Park fire being now the fifth largest in 
California history.
  Seven million acres have burned in the Western States this year. This 
legislation is important across many fire-prone areas.
  Herd agencies are limited in the scope of tools they can consider, 
and often the post-fire teams bear the burden of suggesting creative 
tools, like livestock grazing.
  This isn't creative. This is actually well-known. If they want to 
call it creative, I am for anything that will get us to use this tool 
even more.
  My amendment would enhance the intent of the Fix Our Forests Act and 
help with preventing more catastrophic and preventable fires. It is 
known to work.
  Mr. Chair, I also thank my friend, Mr. Vasquez, for his support with 
this legislation as we partner on this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in 
opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Perry). Is there objection to the request of 
the gentlewoman?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I am not opposed to this amendment, and I have 
worked collaboratively with my colleague, Mr. LaMalfa, across the aisle 
on wildfire issues. I will also congratulate my Democratic colleague, 
Representative Vasquez, for getting this amendment made in order.
  I do want to register the same concerns that I have expressed before. 
The process on the Fix Our Forests Act has been a total black box. A 
good amendment or two does not change the overall bill, which would gut 
bedrock environmental laws.
  Committee Democrats have asked again and again to try to work 
together to reach consensus on this bill, and it would have been a 
great opportunity to talk about this amendment, which, again, I do not 
oppose.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. 
Vasquez), my colleague.
  Mr. VASQUEZ. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment with 
Representative LaMalfa.
  New Mexicans know all too well how disastrous wildfires can be for 
our families, homes, private property, culture, and tradition. We need 
to use every tool in our toolbox to lessen the frequency and severity 
of wildfires.
  Livestock grazing can help us accomplish that goal. Grazing targeted 
areas can help slow the spread of an intense burn and control the 
temperature of a fire by reducing the amount of flammable organic fuel.
  This bipartisan amendment adds the text of our bill, the Utilizing 
Grazing for Wildfire Risk Reduction Act, to the proposed legislation. 
This amendment ensures that grazing is a tool that can be used 
proactively to prevent wildfires and keep New Mexicans safe. It helps 
cut through red tape and makes it easier for ranchers to assist in 
preventing devastating wildfires that destroy our lands, culture, and 
livelihood.
  I appreciate Congressman LaMalfa for working with me on this 
important bipartisan amendment that uses a commonsense approach to 
reduce the threat of wildfires. We know that the cost of fighting 
wildland fires is astronomical, so we must use every available resource 
to prevent future natural and human-caused disasters.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).
  The amendment was agreed to.


          Amendment No. 3, as Modified, Offered by Mr. Valadao

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3, as 
modified, printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment, as 
modified.
  The text of the amendment, as modified, is as follows:


   AMENDMENT NO. 3, AS MODIFIED, OFFERED BY MR. VALADAO OF CALIFORNIA

       At the end of Title III add the following:

     SEC. 307 CONTAINER AERIAL FIREFIGHTING SYSTEM (CAFFS).

       (a) Evaluation.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture and 
     the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the 
     National Interagency Aviation Committee and the Interagency 
     Airtanker Board, shall jointly conduct an evaluation of the 
     container aerial firefighting system to assess the use of 
     such system to mitigate and suppress wildfires.
       (b) Report.--Not Later than 120 days after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
     Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the National 
     Interagency Aviation Committee and the Interagency Airtanker 
     Board, shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees a 
     report that includes the results of the evaluation required 
     under subsection (a).
       (c) Appropriate Committees Defined.--In this section, the 
     term ``appropriate committees'' means--(1) the Committees on 
     Agriculture and Natural Resources of the House

[[Page H5690]]

     of Representatives; and (2) the Committees on Agriculture, 
     Nutrition, and Forestry and Energy and Natural Resources of 
     the Senate.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Valadao) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Westerman and his staff at 
the Natural Resources Committee for their work on this very important 
bill. I appreciate his partnership and work to ensure my amendment was 
included today.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which would 
dramatically increase the number of airlift assets available for 
wildfire emergencies.
  Containerized Aerial Firefighting Systems, or CAFFS, are airdrop-
capable disposable containers for water or fire retardant, which can be 
dropped from much higher altitudes and with less visibility than 
current aerial firefighting operations. Current aerial firefighting 
operations depend on single-mission aircraft, but CAFFS can be used by 
any standard cargo plane.
  The use of CAFFS provides more coverage for firefighters on the 
ground and allows teams to quickly respond to prevent smaller fires 
from becoming uncontrollable. These systems are being used in other 
countries, but not here in the United States. We have the technology 
that we can deploy to stop the devastation these fires cause, and we 
should be using it.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this 
amendment to help combat and contain wildfires in a quicker and more 
efficient way.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in 
opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I am not opposed to this amendment. As 
corrected, it would add a bill that we previously passed in the Natural 
Resources Committee by unanimous consent and then here on the floor on 
suspension by a voice vote.
  I say I am not opposed to this amendment as corrected because this is 
the amendment that I referenced earlier. The amendment that Republicans 
accidentally made in order, a version of this amendment that was 
drafted so badly that would have deleted the entire text of the Fix Our 
Forests Act.
  In other words, it wouldn't have just added Mr. Valadao's bill to the 
overall legislation. It would have deleted the overall bill and 
replaced it with Mr. Valadao's bill, which, as I noted, is a 
noncontroversial bill that Democrats support.
  Republicans came to Democrats this morning to ask for our help in 
fixing that mistake. My concern here is that that is reflective of a 
process problem: the sloppy drafting in the underlying bill, the 
refusal to incorporate well-intentioned feedback from the 
administration, and the exclusion of committee Democrats from 
developing this bill.
  This is bad process.
  I am not opposed to this amendment, which already passed the House 
floor on suspension, but one good amendment is not enough to fix the 
bad bill.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the chairman of the Natural 
Resources Committee.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by Mr. 
Valadao of California.
  This amendment does require the Secretary of the Interior and the 
Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an evaluation of the container 
aerial firefighting system to assess the use of such a system to 
mitigate and suppress wildfires. The Secretaries must conduct this 
evaluation in consultation with the National Interagency Aviation 
Committee and the Interagency Airtanker Board.
  As we attempt to combat the devastating wildfire crisis, it is 
essential that agencies like the U.S. Forest Service are utilizing all 
available technologies to suppress wildfires. The technology supported 
by this amendment involves disposable containers that are dropped with 
water or fire retardant, which could potentially decrease the response 
time to fires and increase the number of aircraft available for 
firefighting duties.
  While the technology is not new, the wildland firefighting agencies 
have not actively studied it. This amendment, therefore, would ensure 
that our wildland firefighting agencies are fully informed about both 
the effectiveness and potential cost savings of this important 
technology.
  Mr. Chair, again, I thank Representative Valadao for his work on this 
amendment. Throughout the drafting process, he has continually 
advocated for the interests of those in his district and correctly 
emphasized the importance of leveraging all available technology and 
resources to better protect vulnerable communities.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, 
offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao).
  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.


                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Garamendi

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment and the 
underlying bill.
  I thank Mr. Westerman as well as Mr. Peters for presenting the bill 
to us. It is a necessary fix to an ongoing challenge that we have in 
our national forests and in the urban-wildland interface areas.
  I also thank Congressman Fallon, who is the cosponsor of this 
amendment.
  Now, what we are trying to do here is to include special districts. 
Right now, special districts are not included in the legislation. 
Tribes and local governments are, and that is all to the good, however, 
in California, special districts often provide the necessary control of 
the areas in the wildland areas as well as in the urban-wildland 
interface.
  Specifically, in my district, we have the East Bay Regional Park 
District. Most of the wildland in the East Bay of San Francisco Bay is 
controlled and owned by the park district.
  Right now, they would not be able to participate in the programs of 
this legislation, so we clarified that special districts are eligible 
to participate in the wildfire-prevention programs authorized under the 
Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, as well in this new 
legislation, the Fix Our Forests Act. This would provide opportunities 
for the special districts to help reduce the wildfire risk, support 
responsible environmental stewardship, and facilitate emergency 
response and all of the other elements in the legislation.
  Secondly, the amendment expands the Good Neighbor Authority to 
include special districts. The Good Neighbor Authority allows the 
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to collaborate with 
States, counties, and federally recognized Indian Tribes to plan and 
implement cross-jurisdictional restoration work.
  Since special districts are not currently included in the Good 
Neighbor Authority, they must collaborate with the State government or 
other eligible entity to participate. Our amendment would finally allow 
the special districts to enter into Good Neighbor Authority agreements 
and use their local expertise and partnerships to advance restoration 
projects in their communities.
  As Western States face an increasingly severe year-round fire season, 
we will need every tool in the toolbox to implement proper forest 
management practices and reduce the risk that wildfires pose to our 
communities.
  Our amendment would put special districts on par with other forms of 
government and allow them to be a strong partner in protecting their 
communities.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt our commonsense, bipartisan 
amendment that would enable the special districts to participate in 
existing conservation efforts and further use their specialized 
expertise to uphold the health and safety of our community.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1545

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan 
amendment offered by the gentleman from California, Representative 
Garamendi, and the gentleman from Texas, Representative Fallon.
  This is a thoughtful amendment that will enable special districts to 
participate in the biochar research and development program established 
in section 301 of the bill. This amendment would also make special 
districts eligible to participate in the Good Neighbor Authority.
  Across the Nation, there are over 39,000 special districts and 
political subdivisions within States, such as resource conservation 
districts or water districts.
  Both the biochar and Good Neighbor Authority sections of this bill 
already allow participation from States, Tribes, and local governments.
  Providing eligibility for special districts is a commonsense change 
to ensure more non-Federal partners can participate in these vitally 
important programs that promote forest health.
  I particularly support expanding access for special districts to the 
biochar projects authorized by section 301 of the bill.
  Biochar is an emerging technology that has shown enormous potential 
as an additive to improve soil health and as a significant carbon 
sequestration tool, and it also helps the water retention ability of 
soil.
  A key barrier to expanding active forest management is a lack of 
market access for low-value hazardous fuels that must be removed from 
overgrown Federal forests.
  Biochar is an innovative solution that could create new markets for 
these low-value materials, thus increasing the pace and scale of forest 
management. I also support adding special districts to the Good 
Neighbor Authority.
  Since 2014, there have been 490 Good Neighbor projects in 34 States, 
and every year, over 273 million board feet of timber is being sold.
  Adding special districts to this program creates new opportunities 
for even more forest management projects that could further increase 
Good Neighbor Authority for forest management activities.
  I thank Representatives Garamendi and Fallon for their efforts to 
improve this legislation by thoughtfully including special districts.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).
  The amendment was agreed to.

[[Page H5692]]

  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.
  The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, thank you very much for the opportunity to present my 
amendment to the Fix Our Forests Act.
  Mr. Chair, I represent a very mountainous region of California, and 
every year we have wildfires burn in my region.
  The problem is particularly acute this year. We have two major 
wildfires that are still burning in my district, the Bridge fire and 
the Line fire. Mr. Chair, together, these fires have consumed nearly 
100,000 acres.
  Thankfully, relatively few structures have been affected this year, 
but Mr. Chair, I was convinced 2 weeks ago that we were going to lose 
over 1,000 homes in my district.
  This problem is particularly acute because the fires spread so 
quickly. Unfortunately, the Line fire that caused the evacuation of 
parts of my hometown in California was started by arson, and that 
arsonist started three different fires that day.
  Two of them, Mr. Chair, firefighters were able to jump on quickly and 
extinguish. It is the third one that spread quickly enough that it 
became the conflagration that threatened many communities in my 
district.
  This amendment prioritizes emerging technology, such as early-
detection technology and the artificial intelligence techniques 
required to process it in the pilot program that this bill establishes.
  Mr. Chair, there is a lot of promise in early-detection technologies. 
Conventional satellite detection relies on satellites and geostationary 
orbits that are far away from the Earth, and therefore, have very poor 
spatial resolution. Those satellites can only detect a fire when it is 
already quite large.
  Mr. Chair, new low-Earth orbit satellites with thermal detection 
technology have much better spatial resolution, and they can detect a 
forest fire when it just begins.
  Moreover, these new technologies can be transmitted to the Earth in 
minutes instead of hours. If you combine that with the artificial 
intelligence processing technology that looks at these images and can 
distinguish between a campfire and a tree that is hit by lightning that 
is the potential source of a forest fire, that is a game-changing 
development in wildfire technology.
  Combine that with fast, aerial, firefighting platforms, and we will 
be able to put out fires before they get started and avoid some of the 
catastrophes that have afflicted my district in recent years.
  I think this is a commonsense amendment. I am thankful it is 
bipartisan. I thank my bipartisan sponsor, Congresswoman Pettersen from 
Colorado, who shares my concern about this, and I urge adoption of my 
amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in 
opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Valadao). Is there objection to the request of 
the gentlewoman from California?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I am not opposed to this amendment, but I 
remain opposed to the underlying bill, which is filled with 
environmental poison pills and which the administration has warned us 
is so poorly drafted that they do not and will not know how to 
implement parts of it. Nothing in this otherwise sound amendment 
addresses these concerns.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the chair of the Natural 
Resources Committee and my friend.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the bipartisan 
amendment offered by Representatives Obernolte of California and 
Pettersen of Colorado, which supports the use of thermal, midwave, 
infrared-equipped, low-Earth orbit satellites.
  It is a mouthful, but it is a good addition to the Fix Our Forests 
Act, and it shows that we are trying to incorporate the latest 
technology. We are trying to incorporate AI technology and more remote 
sensing technology so that we can be on the cutting edge of the fight 
against wildland fire.
  Again, I commend my colleagues for their dedication and willingness 
to work together to ensure that the best solutions can be brought to 
bear on addressing the wildfire crisis.
  I urge everyone to support the amendment and the underlying bill.
  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, 
offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).
  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.

  Our wildland firefighters are heroes. They are at the front lines of 
combating this wildfire crisis every day.
  They work in hazardous conditions, inhaling toxic smoke and enduring 
temperatures of up to 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, all the while working 
up to 18 hours a day.
  Our wildland firefighters put their lives on the line to keep our 
families safe, a job that is so often thankless.
  When a tragic accident occurs and a wildland firefighter is harmed, 
it is our responsibility to provide them with everything they need.
  My amendment will ensure that ill, injured, or deceased firefighters 
and their loved ones have support and resources through establishing a 
Casualty Assistance Program at the Department of the Interior.
  Currently, only a few agencies have this program. For example, the 
Forest Service. Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior does not.
  That means that almost 5,000 Department of the Interior firefighters 
are left out of a program that will provide them and their families 
with these critical resources during the hardest moments in their life.
  These firefighters are trained the same, they are paid the same, and 
most importantly, they do the same work, putting their lives on the 
line every single day as their Forest Service colleagues. Yet, they 
don't receive the same benefits today. My amendment would immediately 
fix this and start giving them the resources that they deserve.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment to ensure all wildland 
firefighters and their families have support and access to the 
resources they deserve.
  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).
  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, we cannot prevent the spread of megafires 
without prioritizing the needs of wildland firefighters and their 
families.
  Wildland firefighters play a critical role managing our forests and 
protecting communities from the threats posed by wildfires.
  We are so grateful to have their support for the underlying bill. 
This is dangerous work, and Congress can and must do more to protect 
these public servants.
  One component of this is providing respectful notification and 
helping families navigate their options when tragedy occurs.
  Congress can take a big step toward that end right now by 
establishing a Casualty Assistance Program at the Department of the 
Interior to provide support for all the critically ill, injured, or 
deceased wildland firefighters and their loved ones.
  While this program already exists for some Federal firefighters, 
almost 5,000 Department of the Interior firefighters and their families 
lack access to this aid, leaving them unsupported during some of the 
hardest, most painful times in their lives.
  Creating a Casualty Assistance Program through the Department of the 
Interior will ensure support for all our Federal wildland firefighters 
and their families.
  We have to provide for those who risk life and limb to protect our 
communities from devastating wildfires. This program is one small way 
that we show gratitude for our firefighters and their loved ones, by 
making sure that they have what they need when the unimaginable 
happens.
  I strongly support the inclusion of Mr. Harder's amendment and the 
inclusion of this necessary program in the Fix Our Forests Act. This is 
only one step toward ensuring our firefighters receive every bit of 
support that they deserve.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I join my colleague, Mr. Peters, rising in 
support today of Representative Harder's amendment, which does 
authorize the Department of the Interior to create a Casualty 
Assistance Program to provide support for wildland firefighters and the 
families of the firefighters who have been critically injured or killed 
in the line of duty.
  As was mentioned, the Forest Service already has a Casualty 
Assistance Program, which provides travel expenses for next of kin to 
visit a wildland firefighter hospitalized due to a line-of-duty injury, 
or worse, killed in action.
  It also provides directions for short- and long-term case management 
procedures for casualty assistance. This commonsense amendment will 
make the same services available to wildland firefighters at the 
Department of the Interior, providing critical support to the families 
of these firefighters.
  As wildfire seasons have grown in both length and severity, the job 
of wildland firefighter has become increasingly dangerous.
  Between 2013 and 2022, 96 wildland firefighter fatalities occurred. 
While Congress works to address the forest conditions that are putting 
wildland firefighters into increasingly dire situations, we must also 
ensure that we are providing adequate support to them and their 
families.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my 
time.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment to 
the Fix Our Forests Act, a terrific piece of bipartisan legislation, 
and I compliment both Chairman Westerman and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Peters) for their leadership on this.
  My amendment would, if enacted, secure the future of the American 
white oak, which is one of the most important tree species in the 
Eastern United States. It occupies 104 million acres in this country 
and is vital for biodiversity, wildlife, and our economy.
  American white oak is used in almost every forest product, including 
furniture, flooring, cabinetry, barrels for aging wine, American 
whiskey and, yes, Kentucky bourbon, which is America's native spirit by 
the definition passed by Congress, and which must be aged in new 
charred white oak barrels.
  Kentucky's Sixth District is home to some of the world's most 
renowned distilleries. The industry as a whole produces over $9 billion 
and more than 23,000 jobs for the Commonwealth annually. Additionally, 
Kentucky distillers exported over $500 million worth of products abroad 
in 2022.
  The problem is that while there is ample mature white oak now, there 
will not be in the future unless immediate and widespread action is 
taken. Young stands of white oak simply don't exist in the amount 
needed to support wildlife and sustainable forestry and do not exist 
for the future of the bourbon industry.
  Reforestation of white oak is challenging because without some 
additional assistance here, white oak is extremely slow growing. Over 
the next 20 years, the population of white oak is expected to drop 
considerably, which will have a significant negative impact on 
Kentucky's ability to age and produce bourbon.
  My amendment addresses this specifically by establishing the White 
Oak Restoration Initiative Coalition to encourage the Forest Service to 
work alongside private and State partners at no cost to the taxpayer.
  Additionally, the amendment asks the U.S. Forest Service and the 
Department of the Interior to regenerate white oak through a series of 
pilot projects in national parks and on volunteered private lands.
  Lastly, it allows the Forest Service to enter into memorandums of 
understanding with land grant institutions to conduct much-needed 
research on white oak.
  This bipartisan amendment does not authorize any new spending or 
programs but instead would work within existing programs and agency 
budgets to preserve our heritage and fortify an industry that is 
critical to Kentucky's economy and is America's native spirit.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in 
opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from California?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I think you know what I am about to say. I am 
not opposed to this amendment, but I continue to strongly oppose the 
underlying bill. It is full of poison pills that harm the environment 
and will spread our Forest Service even thinner right when we need them 
more than ever. Unfortunately, nothing in this amendment addresses 
those concerns.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I would just say to my friend from California 
that former Speaker Henry Clay, who was famous for bringing barrels of 
white oak filled with Kentucky whiskey up to the Capitol Building, used 
to famously say that Kentucky bourbon could lubricate the wheels of 
government. I would hope that the gentlewoman would take that into 
consideration in withdrawing her opposition to this very important 
amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield time to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
Westerman), the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the 
Natural Resources Committee.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I 
rise in strong support of his amendment.
  This amendment will add to the underlying legislation key pieces of 
Representative Barr's bipartisan White Oak Resilience Act, which passed 
out of the Natural Resources Committee unanimously this year.
  While the Fix Our Forests Act primarily addresses the dire state of 
our overgrown and fire-prone forests in the West, this amendment 
addresses an urgent challenge confronting our Eastern forests.
  At current trends, we face an imminent shortage of white oak trees 
throughout their native range of the Eastern United States. Because of 
a lack of necessary forest management practices and shifts in the 
forest environment, we have created a situation where white oak 
seedlings and saplings are not growing at a sustainable rate. 
Presently, roughly 75 percent of white oaks in the U.S. are classified 
as mature. The lack of younger trees is very troubling. Without 
intervention, the white oak population will drastically decline in the 
next 10 to 15 years. White oaks are a keystone species that provide 
immense ecosystem benefits to the many forests within the species' 104-
million-acre range. This iconic American tree is especially important 
for wildlife that is both a preferred food source and habitat for many 
species.
  As Representative Barr mentioned, there are many uses for white oak, 
many uses that are especially important to the great State of Kentucky. 
This is a good amendment that will help restore the long-term viability 
of this beautiful and important tree. I urge my colleagues to support 
the amendment.
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. It is a win-win. It is a win for reforestation, it is a 
win for the Kentucky bourbon industry, and it certainly will help this 
important bipartisan legislation, Fix Our Forests Act, pass.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).
  The amendment was agreed to.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Pettersen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Over 3 million people in my home State of Colorado live in areas at 
moderate to high risk of wildfires, which is over 50 percent of our 
State's population. Since 2001, 20 of the largest wildfires in our 
recorded history have occurred in Colorado, resulting in the loss of 
more than 2,500 homes over the past two decades.
  Wildfires have not only threatened lives but also damaged ecosystems 
and disrupted communities.
  Coloradans feel the devastating impacts of climate change every 
single day. This is our new normal: Fires are burning more frequently 
and more fiercely than ever before.
  It is essential that we recognize the urgency of addressing this 
crisis to protect our communities. While recognizing that this bill 
doesn't include everything that we want to see, it is an important step 
moving forward.
  We need a holistic approach, and this includes investing in 
predisaster mitigation measures, such as strengthening our 
infrastructure in housing and enhancing early detection capabilities, 
supporting our wildland firefighting workforce, and focusing on post-
disaster resilience.
  My amendment is a piece of this comprehensive response. Specifically, 
my amendment will require the Department of the Interior, in 
coordination with States, local governments, Tribes, and colleges to 
identify critical lands in need of reforestation and restoration due to 
natural disasters, and to support projects in those areas.
  By investing in restoration and reforestation projects, we can ensure 
that our communities not only recover but also rebuild in a way that 
enhances their resilience against future disasters.
  Unfortunately, wildfires leave lasting scars on our landscapes and 
can permanently alter our environment, heightening the risk of deadly 
flash flooding and mud flows. I hear from my constituents about their 
concerns regarding wildfires but also, unfortunately, flooding is close 
behind.
  That is why it is important that we pass this amendment to strengthen 
the provisions in the underlying bill and ensure our communities are 
equipped to face the challenges head-on.
  Recovery after a wildfire is a lengthy and challenging process. 
However, my amendment, together with the provisions in the bill, 
represents a step toward building stronger, more resilient communities 
against the threat of wildfires.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment, 
which seeks to expand nursery and seed capacity, support reforestation 
efforts by State, Tribal, and local governments, as well as 
institutions of higher education on lands managed by the Department of 
the Interior.
  I thank the amendment's sponsor for her engagement on this important 
issue. I greatly appreciate her and her staff's willingness to work 
with us on some revisions to the amendment. This amendment will help 
improve badly needed reforestation and restoration activities across 
the Nation by engaging non-Federal partners, including Tribes, who are 
critical partners as we seek to improve the health of our Nation's 
forests.
  The magnitude of our wildfire and forest health crisis demands an 
all-hands-on-deck approach. I am encouraged that this amendment will 
empower non-Federal partners to assist in vital work.
  The Department of the Interior has identified a reforestation backlog 
of roughly 2.4 million acres across their land management agencies. 
This total is likely to grow considering the massive numbers of acres 
lost to wildfires

[[Page H5697]]

in recent years. This is a good amendment and will help tackle the 
enormous reforestation and restoration backlog affecting Department of 
the Interior lands. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this

                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Mullin

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 13, line 1, strike ``predict'' and insert ``predict, 
     using data tools (including artificial intelligence) and 
     other decision support products,''.
       Page 13, line 5, strike ``community'' and insert 
     ``community (including at-risk communities identified in 
     fireshed assessments conducted under section 105)''.
       Page 14, line 2, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 14, line 4, strike the period at the end and insert 
     ``; and''.
       Page 14, after line 4, insert the following new paragraph:
       (8) disseminate data tools (including artificial 
     intelligence) and other decision support products, for use in 
     manners consistent with the purposes described paragraphs (1) 
     through (7), to the following:
       (A) Federal agencies.
       (B) Indian Tribes.
       (C) State and local governments.
       (D) Academic or research institutions.
       (E) Other entities, public or private, identified by the 
     Director.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  My California congressional district sits on the San Francisco 
peninsula and is home to a vibrant innovation economy that supports 
every sector of American industry.
  The leading-edge technologies being developed and improved in the bay 
area have the potential to help keep the rest of California and our 
Western States safe from the risk of wildfire.
  My amendment today seeks to ensure that we are using the best 
technologies available to understand wildfire risk. Artificial 
intelligence, with its potential to analyze large datasets and improve 
predictive models, can and should play an important role in informing 
land management decisions.
  These data tools will be vital for enabling the proposed Fireshed 
Center in the Fix Our Forests Act. This should be an easy vote for 
those who support using the best available technologies to protect 
communities and inform land management activities.
  Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment, 
which would clarify that the Fireshed Center created by this 
legislation can use artificial intelligence and other decision support 
tools to assess fire risk to communities and landscapes.
  The Fix Our Forests Act establishes a new Fireshed Center for 
relevant land management and science-focused agencies to 
comprehensively assess and predict fire across the landscape and in the 
wildland-urban interface. This will reduce fragmentation and create a 
one-stop shop for predictive services that can help inform suppression 
and management decisions across jurisdictional landscapes.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Mullin).
  The amendment was agreed to.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Valadao) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. VALADAO. Madam Chair, my amendment would add the text of my bill, 
the bipartisan Headwaters Protection Act, to the Fix Our Forests Act.
  This commonsense language is led by my colleague from California (Mr. 
Costa) and myself, and it has bipartisan support. It was included in 
the House Committee on Agriculture's farm bill.
  This amendment expands public and private partnerships in forestry 
and watershed management projects under the Water Source Protection 
Program. These projects can improve access to clean drinking water, 
provide for greater downstream water availability, and prevent future 
wildfires.
  My amendment makes changes to improve the program, including 
expanding the number of entities that are eligible to participate in 
the program to include local, regional, and public entities that have 
water management and delivery expertise; allowing non-Federal partners 
to input their knowledge and expertise in the design and implementation 
of forestry and watershed management projects; and allowing for the use 
of existing watershed condition frameworks to reduce bureaucracy and 
deploy projects faster.
  Overall, this amendment would support efforts in the San Joaquin 
Valley like the Olam project, a series of wildlife prevention and 
restoration projects in the Pine Flat watershed between public and 
private partners. This amendment would build off of the good work done 
in the Fix Our Forests Act, and I urge its adoption.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this 
bipartisan amendment being offered by Representatives Costa and Valadao 
of California.
  The Committee on Natural Resources held a field hearing this Congress 
in Representative Valadao's district on the importance of water, and 
this amendment is a bipartisan, good faith effort to help address 
concerns raised at that hearing.
  This bipartisan amendment would expand public and private forestry 
and watershed management partnerships and reduce redundancies under the 
existing Water Source Protection Program.
  Representatives Costa and Valadao's amendment includes good 
governance changes to the Water Source Protection Program. It expands 
the number of eligible lands and entities under the program and reduces 
duplicative application materials and red tape for existing watershed 
restoration action plans.
  Finally, this amendment establishes clear program priorities that 
help align the program to its core mission.
  These changes align with the spirit of the Fix Our Forests Act. 
Oftentimes, we hear calls for more funding to solve a problem. However, 
oftentimes, by focusing on a program's priorities and reducing red 
tape, the cost goes down and funding can be shifted away from 
bureaucracy and toward getting work done on the ground.
  Again, I commend Representatives Valadao and Costa for reaching 
across the aisle to work together on this amendment. I have had the 
pleasure of working with both of these gentlemen on the Save Our 
Sequoias Act.
  Mr. Chair, I encourage support of the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

                Amendment No. 11 Offered by Ms. Boebert

  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Valadao). It is now in order to consider 
amendment No. 11 printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee for the gentleman from 
Montana (Mr. Zinke).
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 31, line 5, strike ``and''.
       Page 31, after line 5, insert the following:

       ``(II) to carry out reconstruction, repair, and restoration 
     of non-National Forest System roads necessary to implement 
     projects on Federal lands;
       ``(III) to construct new permanent roads on Federal lands 
     that are--

       ``(aa) necessary to implement authorized restoration 
     activities; and
       ``(bb) approved by the Federal agency through an 
     environmental analysis or categorical exclusion decision;

       ``(IV) to complete new permanent road construction to 
     replace and decommission an existing permanent road that is 
     adversely impacting forest, rangeland, or watershed health; 
     and''.

       Page 31, line 6, strike ``(II)'' and insert ``(V)''.
       Page 31, line 7, strike ``subclause (I)'' and insert 
     ``subclauses (I) through (IV)''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer the amendment on behalf 
of my friend from Montana, Representative Zinke, which will improve the 
effectiveness of the Good Neighbor Authority.
  The Good Neighbor Authority program enables cross-boundary forest 
management activities with States, Tribes, and counties. Collaborative 
tools like this program are critical to confronting the wildfire crisis 
as raging wildfires don't respect man-made borders that separate 
forests into different jurisdictions.
  Since 2014, over 490 Good Neighbor Authority projects have been 
started in 34 States, and more than 273 million board feet of timber is 
sold yearly through this program.
  Currently, funds from the sale of timber from Good Neighbor Authority 
projects can be used to treat insect-and disease-infested trees, reduce 
hazardous fuels, improve forest health, and restore and repair 
decommissioned Forest Service roads necessary to implement restoration 
activities.
  This amendment would expand the permissible uses of timber receipts 
derived from Good Neighbor Authority projects to include the 
reconstruction, repair, and restoration of roads on non-Forest Service 
lands when such activities are needed to implement forest management 
projects on Federal land.
  New road construction on Federal lands would also be a permitted use 
under this amendment to facilitate authorized restoration projects. 
However, these new road projects would still be required to comply with 
the applicable environmental review processes.

[[Page H5699]]

  Further, this amendment would allow timber receipts to be used to 
construct new roads to replace existing roads that adversely impact 
forest, rangeland, or watershed health.
  Access to areas urgently needing treatment remains a huge challenge 
to improving forest health. Roads are beneficial for forest management, 
provide the public with access to outdoor recreation opportunities, and 
enable safer and more effective wildland firefighting.
  This thoughtful amendment from Representative Zinke will improve 
forest management activities under Good Neighbor Authority by 
empowering partners to overcome some of the access challenges 
preventing badly needed work in our forests.
  Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Zinke for his leadership on this 
issue.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, this amendment would permit the use of Good 
Neighbor Authority revenues for the construction of new roads.
  Currently, the Forest Service manages 372,000 miles of roads across 
193 million acres that they manage. Due to such a large inventory, the 
Forest Service often faces financial difficulties in operation and 
maintenance.
  Over half, over 58 percent, of the Forest Service's $7.66 billion of 
deferred maintenance is related to roads. The Forest Service has a 
colossal network of roads that is already far too big for them to 
maintain.
  For this reason, it is hard to support an amendment that would allow 
the construction of even more roads but doesn't provide any resources 
for the future maintenance of those new Forest Service roads.
  Our Forest Service is spread dangerously thin due to Republican 
budget cuts. This amendment would make the problem even worse.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, this is a good amendment that allows for 
good use of our resources.
  It allows Tribes and local communities to take care of the roads that 
are necessary to access, to be able to do these forest management 
projects, and also to be able to fight fires when they break out and 
stop them before they get too big.
  Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert).
  The amendment was agreed to.

     IV, or Fire Regime V''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that clarifies 
existing authorities may be utilized to prevent wildfires in Fire 
Regimes IV and V, thereby expanding the acres of at-risk forests that 
would be eligible for streamlined management authorities.
  This important amendment is critical to fire mitigation efforts 
across the States of Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, 
California, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Wisconsin, New York, Maine, West Virginia, New Jersey, Rhode Island, 
Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio, Vermont, New 
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, Iowa, Florida, and 
Texas.
  The Forest Service estimates 63 million acres are currently at risk 
of catastrophic wildfire, and each year, nearly 10 million acres in the 
U.S. catch on fire. Colorado also had the three largest recorded 
wildfires in State history in 2020.
  Federal agencies have chosen to spend billions on the back end, 
putting out wildfires as opposed to prioritizing active management 
upfront that would reduce the size and number of wildfires.
  According to the Colorado State Forest Service, more than 24.4 
million acres of Colorado forestland impact Colorado's water supply, 
where 80 percent of the State's population relies on those forested 
watersheds for municipal water supplies.
  Healthy forests act as a natural water filter and storage system and 
are critical to maintaining healthy watersheds. In the United States, 
forests are a source of drinking water for over 180 million people.
  We can reduce the size and severity of wildfires through active 
forest management, which will also help protect our watersheds and 
municipal water supplies.
  Let's actively manage our forests, be good stewards of the land that 
we have been blessed with, and pass this important amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, this amendment would further expand a 
categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act for 
projects completed in two additional fire management regimes.
  For context, one of the new regimes, Fire Regime V, applies to 
vegetation types that rarely burn, typically due to a lack of moisture 
or fuel. The fire return interval in those landscapes is more than 200 
years.
  Because of the categorization of these fire regimes, hazardous fuels 
management is not as high of a priority and does not need a legislative 
categorical exclusion expansion.
  This follows the trend that my Republican colleagues have been 
setting. They have been legislatively expanding categorical exclusions, 
and the Committee on Natural Resources Democrats remain opposed.
  During our debate today, we have shown how meddling in the National 
Environmental Policy Act process is dangerous and how it sets a 
precedent that will do more harm than good. Categorical exclusions are 
most effective when they are developed with expert input by agencies 
and the Council on Environmental Quality instead of mandated by 
Congress.
  This amendment simply continues to build on the slew of National 
Environmental Policy Act waivers that the Fix Our Forests Act advances, 
and it is no surprise that my Republican counterparts have chosen to 
make this amendment in order.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

                              {time}  1630

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I seem to recall just yesterday that my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle had no problem meddling in 
NEPA to get their leftwing projects through CHIPS authorized.
  Mr. Chair, I would like to just highlight the drought that has caused 
these catastrophic wildfires.
  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's 
amendment, and I appreciate the hard work that Representative Boebert 
has put into this thoughtful amendment, which does include Fire Regimes 
IV and V, and as we have these very dry, fire-prone areas out West, it 
is important to include these two fire regimes.
  Again, I support the amendment.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, the proposal of utilizing existing 
authorities to prevent wildfires in Fire Regimes IV and V is crucial as 
it focuses on

[[Page H5700]]

proactive management and streamlining of forest health.
  As someone who prioritizes humans flourishing, I see the value in 
taking measures that can prevent environmental disasters that have 
devastating impacts on human beings and their property.
  It is important to remember that we have the power to shape our 
environment and neutralize dangers through human innovation powered by 
cost-effective energy. In the case of wildfire prevention, this could 
mean better forest management practices, controlled burns to reduce 
fuel load, and advanced fire detection and suppression technologies.
  Again, Mr. Chair, I would urge the adoption of my amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Ellzey). The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                Amendment No. 13 Offered by Ms. Boebert

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 71, line 1, strike ``treatments'' and insert 
     ``treatments, grazing,''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that will ensure 
grazing as one of the hazardous fuels reduction activities authorized 
by the bill.
  Our Federal lands are overgrown and poorly managed, making them more 
susceptible to wildfire and disease. Catastrophic wildfires have taken 
a tremendous toll on Coloradans. These incidents have threatened the 
lives of millions of people and accounted for millions of dollars of 
damages each year.
  Farmers and ranchers have lost crops, livestock, and structures, have 
been evacuated, and had their operations disrupted by smoke, public 
safety power shutoffs, or loss of insurance.
  There are Federal lands in Colorado and the West where we once had 50 
to 100 trees per acre, but now we see 500 to 1,000 trees per acre. 
There are also 6 billion standing dead trees in the Western United 
States. Some people call that a problem. I call it a tinderbox waiting 
to burn.
  Fuel treatments are effective, and Federal agencies have made clear 
that over 90 percent of the fuel treatments are effective in changing 
fire behavior and/or helping with the control of wildfire.
  Grazing animals play an important part in maintaining healthy 
ecosystems by controlling the ecological balance of vegetative species, 
reducing fire fuels that result from the accumulation of nonnative 
plant biomass, and improving the soil health by trampling plant residue 
and their own waste into the soil profile.
  Cattle, sheep, and goats can play a regenerative wildfire mitigation 
role that also provides for our food and fiber needs.
  Let's support our Nation's ranchers and encourage innovative and 
cost-effective hazardous fuel reductions like grazing.
  I urge passage of my amendment that ensures the grazing activities 
are recognized as hazardous fuels reduction work when the agency 
calculates the number of acres treated to reduce hazardous fuels, 
improving transparency and accountability.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment 
being offered by Representative Boebert.
  This amendment ensures that livestock grazing activities are 
considered as hazardous fuels reduction work when Federal land 
management agencies calculate the number of acres treated to reduce 
hazardous fuels.
  Section 302 of the Fix Our Forests Act requires land management 
agencies to submit a yearly hazardous fuels reduction report to 
Congress based on the actual number of acres the respective agencies 
treated over the past year. The goal is to improve transparency and 
accountability.
  Livestock grazing is beneficial for land. Just last month, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture released research showing livestock grazing 
can lower wildfire risk and limit invasive grasses. The rangeland 
scientists who published this report include researchers from 
Representative Boebert's home State of Colorado.
  I, again, thank her for her leadership and for supporting our 
ranching and farming families.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the House Natural 
Resources Committee for supporting this important amendment that 
supports our farmers and ranchers back home and reduces the hazardous 
fuels by allowing grazing to take place on our public lands.
  Again, I urge adoption of this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                Amendment No. 14 Offered by Ms. Boebert

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       Page 38, after line 12, insert the following:
       ``(H) proposals that seek to remove or treat insects or 
     diseases, including the removal of trees killed by, or 
     infested with, bark beetles in Arizona, California, Colorado, 
     Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South 
     Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming;''.
       Page 38, line 13, strike ``(H)'' and insert ``(I)''.
       Page 38, line 23, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(J)''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that will 
require regional foresters to submit a plan through the Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program for the treatment and removal of 
trees killed by or infested with bark beetles in Western States.
  The bark beetle epidemic has caused significant damage to roughly 
100,000 square miles of forest in the Western United States alone. 
There are 600 different species of bark beetles in the United States. 
Several species, such as the mountain pine beetle, attack and kill live 
trees. Most species of bark beetles live in dead, weakened, or dying 
hosts.
  Along the West Coast and through the Rocky Mountains, bark beetles 
have affected tens of millions of acres of forests. While bark beetles 
are native to U.S. forests and play important ecological roles, they 
can cause extensive tree mortality and negative economic and social 
impacts.
  Spruce beetles have killed millions of trees on more than 1.8 million 
acres in Colorado since 2000 and provided increased fuels for 
wildfires. In Colorado, 2021 was one of the worst wildfire seasons our 
State has ever endured with the three largest fires in State history.
  Bark beetle epidemics and catastrophic wildfires are a significant 
threat. This can be minimized by thinning overgrown forests and 
removing hazardous fuels produced by beetle

[[Page H5701]]

overpopulation. This process is sure to create jobs and increase 
overall forest health.
  I urge passage of my amendment that would prioritize Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program activities that address the bark 
beetle epidemic, a major contributor to wildfires in Colorado and the 
West.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, this amendment was summarized by Republicans 
as requiring the regional foresters to develop plans for the treatment 
and removal of dead or dying trees due to insect disease.
  However, I want to clarify that this amendment actually doesn't 
require anything of regional foresters at all. Instead, it requires 
special consideration for project proposals under the Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program that seek to remove or treat 
insects or diseases.
  The purpose of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program 
is to encourage the collaborative science-based ecosystem restoration 
of priority forest landscapes.
  Insect treatments are already eligible under the program and are 
executed often as restoration treatments. However, they are also often, 
and should be, used in tandem with other collaborative strategies as 
part of a broader landscape treatment plan.
  I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, let the beetle battle begin. The bark kill 
epidemic in Colorado and the western United States is a problem that we 
must address. I drive by these dying forests on a regular basis, and 
seeing the tinderbox that it has created is a huge devastation.
  The carbon emissions that are released from a catastrophic wildfire 
are very harmful and impactful to my State of Colorado and the West, so 
I say it is time to do something about the beetle kill, beetle kill, 
beetle kill.
  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), 
the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
thank her for bringing this amendment, which is important. I support 
the amendment.
  Unfortunately, our forests out West are overstocked. They compete 
with each other. They get weak. They invite disease and insect 
infestation. These insects and diseases kill the trees, and then you 
have dry kindling for a lightning strike or a wildfire that gets out, 
and it creates the perfect storm for catastrophic wildfires.
  Again, I thank Representative Boebert for her efforts to improve the 
health of our western forests, and I support the amendment.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                Amendment No. 15 Offered by Ms. Boebert

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 38, after line 12, insert the following:
       ``(H) proposals that seek to facilitate the sale of 
     firewood and Christmas trees on lands under the jurisdiction 
     of the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior;''.
       Page 38, line 13, strike ``(H)'' and insert ``(I)''.
       Page 38, line 23, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(J)''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that 
requires regional foresters to submit a plan on the sale of Christmas 
trees and firewood on Federal land.
  Under current law, American families can purchase a permit from the 
Forest Service to cut Christmas trees from their favorite national 
forest, as well as harvest any firewood, transplants, posts, and poles, 
and other forest products to improve forest health.
  We have seen successful Christmas tree and firewood harvesting 
operations in my home State of Colorado, and this program has served as 
a locally based solution to help thin our overgrown forests.

                              {time}  1645

  According to the Forest Service: ``The permit system helps to thin 
densely populated stands of small-diameter trees. Local forest health 
experts identify areas that benefit from thinning trees and tend to be 
the perfect size for Christmas trees. Removing these trees in 
designated areas helps other trees grow larger and can open areas that 
provide food for wildlife.''
  My constituents are struggling right now as they deal with the 
disastrous effects of the Democrats' destructive economic policies. 
They unleashed record inflation on Americans that has raised utility 
bills, driven up energy costs, and made it harder to live for most 
Americans.
  My amendment provides an affordable fuel alternative for families 
across the Nation to heat their homes as well as create lasting holiday 
memories for families to interact with their local forests.
  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment to 
prioritize collaborative foster landscape restoration program 
activities to allow for the removal of firewood and Christmas trees.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, similar to Ms. Boebert's last amendment, 
this amendment was summarized by Republicans as requiring that regional 
foresters develop plans, in this case the plans for the sale of 
Christmas trees and firewood.
  Once again, I would like to clarify that this amendment does not do 
that. It does not require anything of regional foresters.
  Instead, it requires special consideration for project proposals 
under the collaborative forest landscape restoration program that seek 
to facilitate the sale of Christmas trees and firewood on lands under 
the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of 
the Interior.
  The landscape restoration program was not created for the sole 
purpose of revenue building by removing trees from public lands. The 
program is meant to do what it says in its program title: promote 
collaboration among Federal land management agencies and the public for 
the purposes of restoring forest landscapes.
  Tree harvesting for anything other than the purpose of landscape 
restoration is not in the spirit of the program. By placing a 
preference on projects that are related to Christmas tree harvest, this 
amendment would limit the landscape restoration program by prioritizing 
a marketable product over landscape restoration. To be extra clear, the 
Forest Service already has broad authority to conduct the sale of 
firewood and Christmas trees. They don't need it under this restoration 
program.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, it is so sad to hear my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle hate Christmas.
  This would allow restoration of our forests. As I said, our forests 
are overgrown. This would allow a fun way for families to participate 
in healthy forest management by thinning some of the living trees that 
are overgrown on our forestland.
  Mr. Chair, I, again, urge the adoption of this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and 
for her amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I note that over 2.3 million households rely on firewood 
to heat

[[Page H5702]]

their homes. I didn't say they enjoy a nice evening by the fire. They 
rely on firewood to heat their homes. It is even more common in 
western, rural communities near Federal lands, especially in counties 
with significant Native American communities.
  The Forest Service has made some positive efforts with programs like 
Wood For Life, which provides firewood from forest restoration projects 
in northern Arizona to local Tribal communities that otherwise could 
not afford to heat their homes.
  Providing ample firewood sources to these communities is an essential 
and cost-effective service the Forest Service should be helping to 
provide.
  Also, for as little as $5, more than 300,000 American families 
receive a Christmas tree permit from Forest Service properties each 
year. This not only helps Americans celebrate the Christmas season, but 
it also helps manage our forests through the removal of forest products 
that may otherwise fuel the next wildland fire.
  I commend Representative Boebert for her work on this creative and 
thoughtful amendment that can make a big difference in the lives of 
rural Americans, and I urge its support.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 1 minute 
remaining.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, this legislative proposal is an excellent 
example of how local solutions can make a big difference in managing 
our environment and mitigating risk. The success of Christmas tree and 
firewood harvesting operations in Colorado are a testament to the power 
of human ingenuity when it is coupled with a deep understanding of 
local environments and needs. These operations help to thin overgrown 
forests, reducing the fuel load and therefore the risk of 
uncontrollable wildfires. They also provide valuable resources to the 
local communities turning what could be a negative, overgrown forests, 
into a positive, holiday trees and firewood for heating.
  Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment in the spirit of 
Christmas and heating homes efficiently, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, as a Christian, I am offended that my 
colleague on the other side of the aisle would suggest that I hate 
Christmas.
  This bill is not about and has nothing to do with inhibiting people 
from celebrating their religious holidays, including through having a 
Christmas tree.
  This bill is about this amendment, and this debate is about the fact 
that this amendment does not do what the gentlewoman from Colorado 
claims that it does.
  This bill does not require regional foresters to do anything.
  I support the Forest Service using its existing authority to permit 
the harvesting of Christmas trees and trees for firewood, but that is 
not what this amendment actually does.
  I close by observing to my colleague that many of us make happy 
family memories with trees that are living. We have ways to enjoy trees 
without cutting them down or burning them.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                 Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. LaLota

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 
printed in part D of House Report 118-705.
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of title III add the following:

     SEC. 307. STUDY ON PINE BEETLE INFESTATION.

       Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the 
     Chief of the Forest Service, shall--
       (1) carry out a study on the causes and effects of, and 
     solutions for, the infestation of pine beetles in the North 
     Eastern region of the United States; and
       (2) submit to the relevant Congressional Committees a 
     report that includes the results of the study required under 
     paragraph (1).

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1486, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. LaLota) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his leadership.
  Mr. Chairman, the southern pine beetle, a pest no larger than a grain 
of rice, has emerged as one of the most significant threats to our 
forests in the eastern United States. Nowhere is this issue more 
evident than in my home district on Long Island, where Suffolk County 
has been hit especially hard.
  Since the pine beetle first appeared on Long Island in 2014, it has 
destroyed approximately 5,000 acres of forest, including an estimated 
800 acres this year alone.
  The pine barrens region in Suffolk County is suffering devastation, 
as countless once-green trees have turned yellow and orange, clear 
evidence that they are dying. This damage doesn't just affect the 
trees. It threatens an ecosystem that is home to dozens of animals and 
plants, including endangered species.
  These forests are crucial for preserving clean drinking water, and if 
we don't take action now, we risk irreparable harm to this vital 
resource. State officials have been working tirelessly to manage the 
spread of the beetle through surveillance and the removal of dead and 
infested trees. However, this problem is growing exponentially due to 
warmer winters and drought conditions, and we need a more comprehensive 
approach to understand and combat this threat.
  That is why my amendment here today is so important.
  Mr. Chairman, my commonsense amendment would direct the Secretary of 
Agriculture to conduct a comprehensive study on the impact of beetle 
infestations in the northeastern region of the United States.
  The detailed study will investigate the causes, effects, and 
potential solutions to this growing problem, with a particular focus on 
our forests in the northeast.
  This amendment is about more than just studying a pest. It is about 
protecting the natural heritage of the northeast, securing clean water, 
and ensuring the health and resiliency of our forests for future 
generations.
  A comprehensive study will help us understand why these beetles have 
moved north and how we can mitigate their impact. It will provide the 
scientific foundation needed to implement effective management 
strategies, preserve our forests, and maintain the ecological balance 
that is so vital to the region.
  Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Westerman for his support on this 
amendment and his leadership on the Fix Our Forests Act, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from California?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I am going to close out my comments on all of 
these amendments by reiterating what I have been saying.
  I strongly oppose the underlying bill. It is full of poison pills 
that harm the environment and will spread our Forest Service even 
thinner right when we need them most.
  If Republicans had listened to the administration's concerns about 
how this bill is poorly drafted, and if they hadn't excluded committee 
Democrats from the drafting process then maybe we could have a 
consensus set of solutions in front of us.
  Instead, we have a bill full of environmental rollbacks, new unfunded 
programs that will spread our Forest Service thin, and no pay fix for 
our firefighters. It is a supposed wildfire response bill, but it 
doesn't have firefighter pay in it.
  It is a bill that is being offered by Republicans who style 
themselves as fiscally conservative. Yet, as we approach a final vote 
on this legislation in a

[[Page H5703]]

matter of minutes, we do not know the costs of the bill because 
Republicans through a rushed process made sure that the Congressional 
Budget Office did not have a chance to score the bill.
  Nothing in this amendment addresses any of these extensive and 
serious concerns.
  I strongly oppose the bill, as does Ranking Member Grijalva, as does 
the White House.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
Westerman).
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New York for 
yielding.
  Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, Representative LaLota, for filing this 
amendment which seeks to address the serious threat to forests in the 
American northeast. The amendment does require the Forest Service to 
conduct a study on the causes and effects of the infestation of pine 
beetles in the northeastern region of the U.S. and offer solutions to 
the pressing problem.
  The southern pine beetle is an invasive species that has been 
expanding into northeastern forests in recent years. As a southerner, I 
wish all the southern pine beetles would leave the South, but I don't 
wish them on my friends in the North.
  It is an invasive species that poses a serious threat to the health 
of pine forests in the North.
  Concerning tree mortality has been documented in recent years in 
pitch pine stands in several northeastern States, including New York, 
New Jersey, and Connecticut.
  The expansion of this invasive species into northern forests is 
concerning and warrants our attention.
  This is a good amendment that addresses a very real threat to forests 
in the northeast. Examining this threat further and developing 
solutions to prevent, treat, and detect insect infestations is an 
important endeavor.
  I, again, applaud Representative LaLota for his leadership in this 
effort, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mooney). The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, 
the Committee rises.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
Ellzey) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mooney, Acting Chair of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 8790) to

           MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR BIRMINGHAM SHOOTING VICTIMS

  (Ms. SEWELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to 
recognize the victims of the horrific mass shooting that rattled my 
Birmingham, Alabama, community over the weekend.
  On Saturday night, just after 11 p.m., 21 people were shot in 
Birmingham's Five Points South entertainment district, and four lost 
their lives.
  Our thoughts are with the families as they endure this unimaginable 
loss, and we pray for a speedy recovery for those that were injured.
  James 2:26 teaches us that faith without works is dead. While our 
thoughts and prayers are important, only by taking meaningful action 
can we stem this needless loss of life.
  Elected officials at every level must do all we can to eliminate the 
epidemic of gun violence that is raging in our communities. It is past 
time for Congress to act.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence for the 
Birmingham victims of Saturday night's mass shooting and their 
families.

                     MICHEL O. MACEDA MEMORIAL ACT

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 5302) to designate the Air and Marine Operations 
Marine Unit of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection located at 101 Km 
18.5 in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, as the ``Michel O. Maceda Marine 
Unit''.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 5302

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

        This Act may be cited as the ``Michel O. Maceda Memorial 
     Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

        Congress finds the following:
       (1) Marine Interdiction Agent Michel O. Maceda served 
     honorably in the United States Army as a wheeled vehicle 
     mechanic prior to joining the United States Border Patrol as 
     an Agent in Douglas, Arizona, in April 2016.
       (2) Agent Maceda became a Marine Interdiction Agent with 
     U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations 
     in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, in 2021.
       (3) On November 17, 2022, Agent Maceda and 2 other agents 
     were conducting a drug interdiction stop off the coast of 
     Puerto Rico, during which the agents boarded the target 
     vessel.
       (4) During the stop, Agent Maceda was mortally wounded when 
     1 of the occupants of the vessel shot the boarding agents 
     with a firearm.
       (5) Agent Maceda is survived by his daughter, brother, and 
     parents.

     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION.

       The Air and Marine Operations Marine Unit of the U.S. 
     Customs and Border Protection located at 101 Km 18.5 in Cabo 
     Rojo, Puerto Rico, shall forever be known and designated as 
     the ``Michel O. Maceda Marine Unit''.

     SEC. 4. REFERENCES.

       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, 
     or other record of the United States to the marine unit 
     referred to in section 3 shall be deemed to be a reference to 
     the ``Michel O. Maceda Marine Unit''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Green) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.


                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5302, the Michel O. Maceda 
Memorial Act.
  On November 17, 2022, Marine Interdiction Agent Michel Maceda was 
conducting a drug interdiction stopped 14 miles off the coast of Puerto 
Rico when he was tragically mortally wounded in a firefight with drug 
smugglers. Agent Maceda's heroism and service to our country is a debt 
that can never be repaid.
  This legislation would designate Air and Marine Operations Unit in 
Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, as the Michel O. Maceda Marine Unit. I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this gesture, recognizing a monumental 
hero.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are considering H.R. 5302, the 
Michel O. Maceda Memorial Act. This legislation reminds us of the men 
and women in law enforcement and the risks that they face every day to 
keep our communities safe. Marine Interdiction

[[Page H5705]]

Agent Michel Maceda is one of those heroes.
  For years, Agent Maceda served as a U.S. Army veteran, a former 
Border Patrol agent, and a Marine Corps interdiction agent for CBP's 
Air and Marine Operations. He was a dedicated public servant who put 
his life on the line time and time again.
  On November 17, 2022, Agent Maceda was doing his job stopping drug 
smugglers in the high seas. On that day, Agent Maceda and other marine 
agents interdicted a narcotics-smuggling vessel just 12 miles off the 
coast of Puerto Rico.
  During the ensuing gunfight, Agent Maceda was killed and two other 
agents were seriously injured. Thanks to their heroic actions that day, 
3,000 pounds of cocaine did not reach our country.
  This bill renames the CBP Air and Marine Operations unit in Puerto 
Rico after Agent Maceda.
  A few months ago, I visited Puerto Rico, and Agent Maceda's name came 
up again and again and again. It is clear that Agent Maceda is missed 
by his community and his colleagues.
  With this bill, we honor Agent Maceda's sacrifice and commitment to 
our Nation, as well as the work of others like Agent Maceda, those who 
put their lives at stake on a day-to-day basis to protect the American 
people.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).
  Mrs. GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
bipartisan legislation, H.R. 5302, the Michel O. Maceda Memorial Act. 
This bill will designate the Mayaguez Marine Unit of U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection Air and Marine Operations or CBP AMO in Cabo Rojo, 
Puerto Rico, in honor of Marine Interdiction Agent Michel Maceda, who 
died in the line of duty while conducting a drug interdiction operation 
off the island's coast.
  On the morning of November 17, 2022, CBP AMO agents were alerted of a 
suspicious vessel located approximately 13 miles off the southwestern 
coast of Puerto Rico.
  Marine Interdiction Agents Michel Maceda, Jorge Santiago, and Mark 
Lamphere arrived in the area to intercept the boat suspected of 
smuggling cocaine. As they were boarding the vessel, one of the drug 
traffickers opened fire on them.
  Agents Santiago and Lamphere were gravely injured. Agent Santiago has 
thankfully recovered and is back to full duty. Agent Lamphere continues 
the long recovery from his wounds in anticipation of returning to full 
duty soon. It has been 2 years.
  Unfortunately, Agent Maceda was mortally wounded during the shoot-out 
and passed away later that day in the hospital.
  Agent Maceda began his CBP career in April of 2016 as a U.S. Border 
Patrol agent in Douglas, Arizona. In 2021, he transferred to AMO and 
served as a marine interdiction agent with the Mayaguez Marine Unit in 
Puerto Rico until the time of his death. Prior to joining CBP, Agent 
Maceda honorably served our Nation in the U.S. Army as a wheeled 
vehicle mechanic. He is survived by his daughter, brother, and parents.
  Agent Maceda's death is a stark reminder of the dangers our CBP 
agents face each day to secure our Nation's borders, including our 
Caribbean border in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. His 
sacrifice is also a testament to their bravery and unwavering 
commitment to keep our communities safe.
  For the heroic actions during the November of 2022 drug interdiction 
operation off Puerto Rico's coast, which led to the seizure of over 
2,900 pounds of cocaine, the White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy recognized Agent Maceda, CBP AMO's Caribbean air and 
marine branch, and partners from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Puerto 
Rico Police Bureau with a 2022 Marine Interdiction Award.
  In February of 2023, CBP began construction of a new modernized 
facility for the Mayaguez Marine Unit, Agent Maceda's unit, to support 
its critical border security mission in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean 
region. I had the honor of attending the groundbreaking ceremony and 
made a commitment to work in Congress to rename the unit after this 
American hero. I am glad that today we are one step closer to making 
this a reality.

  Agent Maceda gave his life protecting Puerto Rico and the rest of our 
Nation from the threats posed by drug traffickers and transnational 
criminal organizations. Officially designating the CBP AMO Mayaguez 
Marine Unit as the Michel Maceda Marine Unit will be a fitting tribute 
to his memory and sacrifice.
  I thank the Homeland Security Committee chair, Mr. Green, and the 
ranking member for cosponsoring and helping bring this bill to the 
floor, but I also thank Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who introduced a 
companion version of my bill.
  Let me also thank the men and women of CBP for their work to secure 
our Nation's land and maritime borders and their support for this 
legislation to honor their fallen colleague. In particular, I recognize 
AMO Executive Assistant Commissioner Jonathan Miller and CBP's Office 
of Congressional Affairs for their assistance and advocacy for this 
bill.
  Lastly, I commend the Federal and local law enforcement agencies in 
Puerto Rico who have made it a priority to seek justice for Agent 
Maceda and ensure those responsible for his death face the consequences 
of their crime.
  A joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
Homeland Security investigations, with the collaboration of CBP, the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, 
and the Puerto Rico Police Bureau targeted the drug trafficking 
organizations responsible for killing Agent Maceda and injuring his two 
partners. As of today, Federal agencies have arrested, and the U.S. 
Attorney's office has indicted, 18 individuals.
  As we approach the 2-year anniversary of his death, I urge my 
colleagues in the House to support H.R. 5302 and ensure we honor Marine 
Interdiction Agent Maceda's life, sacrifice, and the legacy of his 
service.
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  In closing, I thank Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon for introducing this 
legislation and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their 
support. By passing this bill, we honor the memory of Agent Maceda and 
the other men and women of DHS who, like Agent Maceda, risk their lives 
on a daily basis to protect us here in this great country.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5302, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time to close.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5302. The frontline 
personnel who work tirelessly to protect our homeland are the reason we 
can all sleep soundly at night. This bill extends our gratitude to 
Michel O. Maceda for his heroism and service to this great Nation. I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5302.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

             THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EDUCATION ACT OF 2023

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 4259) to amend the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act to require notification with respect to individualized 
education program teams, and for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 4259

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Think Differently about 
     Education Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR IEP TEAMS.

       Section 614(d) of the Individuals with Disabilities 
     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)) is amended by adding at the 
     end the following:

[[Page H5706]]

       ``(8) Notification required.--At the beginning of each 
     school year, each local educational agency, State educational 
     agency, or other State agency, as the case may be, shall 
     notify each parent of a child with a disability in the 
     agency's jurisdiction that such parent may, under paragraph 
     (1)(B)(vi), include individuals who have knowledge or special 
     expertise regarding the child, including related services 
     personnel as appropriate, as part of the individualized 
     education program team for such child.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bean) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 4259.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4259, the Think 
Differently about Education Act of 2023.
  America's children are our Nation's future leaders, and they deserve 
to be equipped with the resources they need to succeed in the 
classroom. This is something that everyone can and should agree on. 
Every child, including children with learning differences, has unique 
needs that must be met and understood by teachers and school 
administrators.
  H.R. 4259 builds on existing progress achieved by the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act by adding another layer of critical 
protections for parents of children with disabilities.
  Under this legislation, educational agencies would be required to 
properly inform parents of their right to bring in outside experts who 
can advocate for the best interests of their children when it comes to 
their education. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, this bill will improve 
families' ability to advocate for their children to receive an 
education that allows them to flourish.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a solution that safeguards parental rights and 
reaffirms the fundamental role of parents in the care, upbringing, and 
education of their children. The simple truth is that every child has 
the potential to flourish when given the right support.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the motion to suspend the rules and agree to 
the bill H.R. 4259.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion is withdrawn.

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1800

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4259, the Think 
Differently about Education Act.
  The bill requires schools to notify parents of their rights under the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Parents can invite experts 
with specialized knowledge of their child to attend the child's 
individualized education program meeting. This is important because key 
decisions are being made about their child's education in this meeting.
  This proposal actually restates present law, but it ensures that 
parents are aware of and can exercise a right they have under current 
law.
  However, I want to make it clear that I am not advocating for further 
amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act at this 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do 
the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Molinaro), the bill's sponsor.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful that my Think 
Differently about Education Act has come to the floor today.
  This builds off of an initiative we launched in my home county about 
a decade ago. We launched the ThinkDIFFERENTLY initiative as a means of 
embracing every one of every ability, creating a community that is more 
welcoming and supportive. The focus has been to break down barriers and 
create opportunities for those with intellectual, physical, and 
developmental disabilities.
  ThinkDIFFERENTLY is simply a call to action. This bill, the Think 
Differently about Education Act, builds on the success of that 
ThinkDIFFERENTLY initiative.
  This bill requires that public schools, K-12, notify parents of a 
child with a disability about their right to a third-party advocate in 
IEP meetings. Individualized education program plans are a document 
that outlines the educational needs of children with a disability, 
tailored specifically for them in coordination with the school, the 
parent or guardian, and the child.
  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as 
IDEA, requires public schools to develop an IEP plan for every student 
with a disability. IDEA also entitles that the child and parent are 
able to bring a third-party advocate to the IEP meeting. However, in 
most cases, sadly, parents are unaware of their rights. Because of 
that, CSE meetings are conducted without parents knowing what 
resources, support, and educational opportunities might be available to 
their children.
  In many cases, this leaves parents and guardians who are not always 
familiar with IDEA and everything that should be included in an IEP 
confused and, sadly, left out, their children losing great opportunity, 
which is also often self-interested. Many times, school districts are 
focused on financial benefits instead of providing the direct benefits 
of a quality and full education to those with disabilities.
  Now, I know this firsthand as the parent of a child with a 
disability. While my daughter, Abigail, now 20 years old, continues to 
benefit from quality education in our home school district, too many 
families like ours have had to navigate this system without the 
knowledge of and partnership of a third-party advocate.

[[Page H5707]]

  My bill would ensure that parents are fully aware of their rights to 
bring a third-party advocate to an IEP meeting to ensure that their 
child is getting the most comprehensive and disability-specific IEP 
plan possible.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a very basic, commonsense bill that builds on 
the need to ensure that every one of every ability has their right to 
pursue a fulfilled life, a pursuit of happiness.
  For those living with intellectual, physical, and developmental 
disabilities, far too often, they are restrained and restricted from 
doing so because they are not provided the broad access to a quality 
education.
  In this case, we simply remind school districts that parents have the 
right to have a third party standing beside them navigating that 
system, and in the end, I think more individuals with disabilities will 
attain the education opportunities they so deserve.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Houchin), who serves on the Committee on 
Education and the Workforce and is celebrating her birthday today.
  Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of a 
critical piece of legislation, the Think Differently about Education 
Act, as a proud cosponsor.
  This bill is about empowering families, ensuring transparency, and 
providing the necessary support to students with disabilities as they 
navigate their educational journey.
  Each year, in thousands of schools across the Nation, individualized 
education program meetings, or IEP meetings, are taking place. Parents 
and school staff come together to develop a personalized plan that 
addresses the unique needs of every child.
  However, many parents face these meetings feeling overwhelmed and 
unsure. Some may not realize they have a right to bring an advocate, 
therapist, or lawyer to help them through the process. Unfortunately, 
most parents sit in these meetings without the support they deserve.
  This is where the Think Differently about Education Act steps in, a 
simple, commonsense solution, but one that can make a world of 
difference. It would require K-12 schools to inform parents of their 
right to bring a third-party advocate to IEP meetings.
  By empowering parents with this knowledge, we can ensure they are 
fully supported as they advocate for their child's education.
  This isn't just about informing parents. It is about creating a 
culture where families feel supported and engaged in their child's 
educational journey.

  Every child deserves a quality education that meets their unique 
needs, and every family deserves to be empowered to advocate for their 
child.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Think Differently 
about Education Act so that we can support more families on this 
journey.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, the Think Differently about Education Act is a 
bipartisan bill that requires schools to notify parents of their right 
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to bring an 
expert with specialized knowledge or expertise regarding their child to 
individualized education program meetings.
  While parents clearly have this right under current law, they might 
not always be appropriately informed about their rights. This 
legislation ensures that parents will know that they can include 
experts who can assist them in shaping an IEP that meets the student's 
individual needs.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and encourage my colleagues to 
support it as well.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, all children, including children with learning 
disabilities, deserve a high-quality education that prepares them for 
full participation in society.
  H.R. 4259, the Think Differently about Education Act of 2023, builds 
upon the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which gives 
teachers, parents, and schools the tools to ensure students in special 
education receive the opportunities they deserve.
  H.R. 4259 would make it easier for families to ensure their children 
will have the tools they need to succeed in school. Every child has the 
potential to flourish when just given the right support.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bean) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4259, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

     SEC. 4. JEANNE CLERY CAMPUS SAFETY ACT.

       Paragraph (19) of section 485(f) of the Higher Education 
     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(19)), as so redesignated, is 
     amended by striking ``Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus 
     Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act'' and 
     inserting ``Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act''.

     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

       Nothing in this Act, or an amendment made by this Act, 
     shall be construed to affect the rights (including remedies 
     and procedures) available to persons under the First 
     Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or rights 
     to due process.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Molinaro). Pursuant to the rule, the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Scott) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.


                             General Leave

  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 5646.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Utah?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Stop Campus Hazing 
Act, H.R. 5646.
  Given that it is National Hazing Prevention Week, I am pleased that 
we are considering this bipartisan bill. H.R. 5646 will help ensure 
that our campuses remain safe environments for all students.
  Safety is a top priority for the Committee on Education and the 
Workforce's agenda and is boldly highlighted in H.R. 5646.
  Hazing has been a persistent problem in America's postsecondary 
education. In fact, a national study on hazing found 55 percent of 
college students involved in clubs, teams, and organizations 
experienced hazing. The same report found students' exposure to hazing 
prevention efforts is limited.
  Since the year 2000, there have been more than 100 hazing-related 
deaths.
  On September 21, 2023, Republican and Democratic lawmakers introduced 
the Stop Campus Hazing Act with the aim to combat hazing and protect 
students across the country. The House Committee on Education and the 
Workforce passed this bill on September 11, 2024.
  If enacted, the bill would do the following.

[[Page H5709]]

  First, the bill would add hazing incidents to the Clery Act ``Annual 
Security Report,'' enhancing the transparency of campus crime 
statistics.
  Second, the bill would require universities to develop campus-wide 
educational programs aimed at preventing hazing. Additionally, it 
requires an institution to report publicly on their websites the 
findings of student organizations' hazing violations so students and 
parents can make informed choices on whether or not to join student 
organizations.
  The Stop Campus Hazing Act is a result of tireless advocacy from 
affected families, campus safety professionals, and dedicated 
organizations. The legislation responds to the needs of these 
stakeholders while also balancing any additional burden on 
institutions.
  This is why this legislation is so critical. It respects 
institutions' existing processes and provides clear guidance on 
reporting and transparency.
  Hazing is a persistent issue that endangers young lives and 
undermines the very promise of an educational environment conducive to 
learning.
  By strengthening policies around hazing prevention and reporting, we 
are reinforcing the message that student safety comes first. With that, 
let's pass the Stop Campus Hazing Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, extracurricular groups, athletic teams, and on-campus 
organizations are formed to serve common objectives while providing a 
safe and welcoming environment for students.
  However, hazing is a dangerous and yet all-too-common practice that 
runs counter to the values of these organizations and threatens student 
health and safety.
  Too many lives have already been lost because of hazing, including 
one in my State of Virginia. In 2021, Adam Oakes, a freshman at 
Virginia Commonwealth University, tragically died because of an 
alcohol-related hazing incident at a fraternity.
  Regrettably, since 2000, there have been over 100 hazing-related 
deaths on college campuses nationally.
  The fact is that nothing can lessen the agony of losing a child or a 
friend. However, I am hopeful that from these tragedies, Congress can 
step in and help students and families avoid future tragedies.
  We are here today because of the tireless advocacy of families and 
friends who have lost loved ones from hazing. For years, these families 
have worked to advance State and Federal policies to end hazing and 
protect students. Some of those families have joined us in the gallery 
today.
  The bipartisan Stop Campus Hazing Act, H.R. 5646, would protect 
students from hazing on college campuses by improving reporting and 
prevention standards.

                              {time}  1815

  Specifically, it mandates that colleges and universities report 
hazing occurrences in their annual Clery reports, the incidents of 
crime reports, establishes campus-wide anti-hazing education programs 
and increases transparency about past hazing incidents so students can 
make informed decisions about joining campus organizations. Taken 
together, these policies create a roadmap for a cultural shift in 
hazing on our campuses that will save students' lives.
  I thank the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath) and the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) for their leadership on this issue.
  I support H.R. 5646 and encourage my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5646, the Stop Campus Hazing Act.
  This legislation, which is long overdue, will finally provide 
additional protection for students on college campuses nationwide. This 
is a bipartisan product years in the making. It includes provisions 
from two previous anti-hazing bills, including a piece of legislation I 
was proud to lead on called the END ALL Hazing Act.
  Simply put, the Stop Campus Hazing Act would improve hazing reporting 
and prevention on college campuses, including by requiring hazing 
incidents to be reported by institutions in their annual security 
report, also known as the Clery report.
  The bill also outlines a responsible definition of ``hazing'' so the 
campus safety professionals can analyze if a reported incident may 
constitute hazing for the Clery report.
  This definition will help students, parents, and the public have 
access and increased transparency into student organizations on 
campuses who have reported incidents of hazing.
  Finally, this bill builds upon the actions many States have taken, 
including Pennsylvania, to ensure that State laws are respected when 
any investigations are conducted.
  Mr. Speaker, none of this would be possible without the long and 
tireless work of many advocates, including Evelyn and Jim Piazza. 
Evelyn and Jim are the parents of Tim Piazza, who tragically passed 
away in February 2017 at Penn State as a direct result of a hazing 
ritual at his fraternity. Tomorrow would have been Tim's 27th birthday.
  In the face of this unspeakable tragedy, Evelyn and Jim have been at 
the forefront of efforts in Pennsylvania, here in Congress, and in 
other States around the country to speak about the dangers of hazing 
and enact change in Tim's honor.
  In fact, the legislation before us today is shaped by the work of the 
Timothy J. Piazza Center for Fraternity and Sorority Research and 
Reform at Penn State, which Evelyn and Jim played a direct role in 
establishing.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the numerous individuals and organizations that 
helped bring this legislation to the floor today, including 
Congresswoman McBath, Congressman Duncan, the National Panhellenic 
Conference, the North American Interfraternity Conference, the Clery 
Center, the Anti-Hazing Coalition, and many others.
  As we recognize National Hazing Prevention Week this week, I am proud 
that we can come together in a bipartisan manner to protect students 
nationwide in an effort to ensure that no one will have to experience 
what the Piazza family has over the past 7 years.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the lead sponsor on the 
legislation.
  Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I think this is truly one of the best 
representative policies for bipartisanship. When our children are dying 
and when our children are no longer safe in their environments, when 
they are simply going to school to get an education, I cannot think of 
a greater time for bipartisanship. I thank Congressmen Owens, Scott, 
and Duncan so very much for their willingness to save our children.
  My son, Jordan, was killed in a shooting in 2012, so I know the pain 
of losing a child. I know the hole that it leaves in your soul and the 
questions it leaves you behind to dwell on; the feelings of guilt and 
yearning to do anything that you can to reverse the irreversible and to 
spend just a little bit more time with that person who was taken from 
you far too soon. You want to tell them all the things that you wish 
that you could have during their short time here on Earth, but we know 
that we are not that lucky.
  The only thing that we can do now is harness that pain and try to do 
something positive with it. Harness it and try to make a lasting change 
that will prevent other families from suffering a similar tragedy. We 
must try to create a legacy that truly speaks to the memory of that 
person that you loved so deeply.
  This is the reason why I came to Congress, and the same reason why 
Jeanne Clery's parents took their power back and got the Clery Act 
signed into law after the tragic killing of their daughter on campus in 
1986.
  Jeanne Clery's parents made the same argument that I have heard time 
and time again from families all over this country who have lost loved 
ones to hazing at colleges and universities: If we had only known; if 
only we had been made aware sooner; if only we had been given a clearer 
picture of the situation that took our child away from us, maybe we 
could have done something.

[[Page H5710]]

  That is what this bill is about. It is about transparency and 
accountability, empowering students and families so that they can make 
informed decisions about the schools that they attend or the clubs that 
they join.
  It is about ensuring that college remains a place of new beginnings 
and hope for our children's future. It is simply about just saving 
lives.
  I thank all of the families who have been working on this effort for 
so many years and who are watching from home but also watching here 
with us today in our House gallery.
  I thank Hank Nuwer for his years of meticulous research on the 
history of hazing deaths in this country.
  I thank Representatives Jeff Duncan and Glenn Thompson for their 
commitment to helping to see this bill through.
  I thank Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member  Bobby Scott and their staff 
for coming together on this truly critical issue.
  With efforts like these we are showing the American people that 
regardless of what they see on social media or whatever they see on TV, 
there are still people in Washington who are willing to put 
partisanship aside, engage in good faith together, and do the hard work 
that is so necessary to make positive change for the folks that are 
relying on us back home.
  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. I am so 
encouraged by this measure to come together to say the least of these, 
to save our children. They deserve so much more from us, and in these 
moments today we are giving them what they deserve, a chance to 
survive, a chance to grow and to prosper, and a chance to be in America 
the way it is designed for them to be.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair respectfully and very politely 
reminds Members that the rules don't allow references to persons in the 
gallery.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Duncan), the lead sponsor of this bill.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H.R. 5646, the 
Stop Campus Hazing Act, legislation that I have been the lead 
Republican cosponsor of for the past three Congresses.
  Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago last Saturday, a young man named Tucker 
Hipps, a senior counselor at Palmetto Boys State, and a political 
science major like myself at my alma mater Clemson University, was 
found in the waters of Lake Hartwell, having fallen off a bridge in an 
apparent and suspected incident of campus hazing.
  Mr. Speaker, 10 years later, the Hipps family, who are with us today, 
are still searching for justice for Tucker. I continue to pray that 
they find those answers.
  I am proud of the South Carolina State legislature that they named 
their campus hazing legislation after Tucker.
  Today, I am proud to bring bipartisan legislation to the House floor 
along with my friend that you just heard from, my colleague 
Congresswoman McBath, to honor Tucker's memory and the memories of 
hundreds of other campus hazing victims by mandating greater 
transparency in fraternity hazing reporting.
  No parent should have to endure what Gary and Cindy Hipps have had to 
go through, the senseless loss of a beloved son. The, as yet, fruitless 
search for answers or bringing those responsible to justice.
  Yet, in Tucker's loss and the loss of so many others, we may learn 
lessons that inform the policy choice that we make today.
  We act today so that parents may know and make informed decisions 
about the colleges that they send their kids off to.
  I thank all the people involved in this legislation that has taken 
way too long, from Cindy Hipps to the Clery Center to the DeVercelly 
family. I thank them for being here today. I thank Chairwoman Foxx and 
Ranking Member Scott for their support, as well as Clemson University 
and the fraternal councils for realizing the need to move forward with 
these reforms. I thank the sponsor of this bill, Congresswoman McBath, 
for all her tireless efforts to bring us here today.
  May God bless the memory of Tucker Hipps, and in his memory, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).
  Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of names of 
students who died from hazing-related activities. This is a list of 
known hazing deaths from 1847 to 2023. These are the names that we 
honor today with this legislation.

  Mrs. McBATH. Mr. Speaker, while we have a number of hazing victims' 
families who are joining us today here in the House gallery, we know 
that hazing has taken hundreds of lives and impacted countless 
families.
  I would also like to thank Dr. Hank Nuwer for his years of research 
in compiling this list. Without this important work, hazing prevention 
work would not have come as far as it has.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

[[Page H5712]]

  

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time for the purpose of closing.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following letters of 
support. One is from the Clery Center and the StopHazing organization, 
along with a list of endorsing organizations, including the National 
Association of Clery Compliance Officers and Professionals, the 
American College Health Association, the International Association of 
Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, the National Pan-Hellenic 
Council, Incorporated, which represents the Divine Nine, NASPA-Student 
Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, and another letter from the 
Anti-Hazing Coalition, which includes a number of hazing victims' 
families, the Hazing Prevention Network, the National Panhellenic 
Conference, and the North American Interfraternity Conference.
                                                     Clery Center,


                                                  Stop Hazing,

                                               September 23, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries: On behalf of 
     StopHazing and Clery Center, we are writing to express our 
     strong support for H.R. 5646, the Stop Campus Hazing Act, and 
     to urge its swift passage. This bipartisan legislation offers 
     a critical opportunity to address the persistent issue of 
     hazing, a practice that continues to threaten the health, 
     safety, and well-being of students on college campuses across 
     the United States.
       Hazing remains a deeply troubling problem in our higher 
     education system. More than half of college students involved 
     in co-curricular activities like athletic teams, 
     fraternities, sororities, and other campus groups experience 
     hazing, according to the National Study of Student Hazing. 
     Even more concerning is the fact that many incidents go 
     unreported, with students feeling pressured to remain silent 
     due to the social dynamics that reinforce these harmful 
     traditions. Tragically, since 2000, college hazing has led to 
     more than 100 student deaths; countless physical injuries, 
     and psychological damage from the abusive behavior. These 
     realities highlight the urgency of adopting meaningful 
     reforms to end these senseless practices.
       The Stop Campus Hazing Act represents a crucial step toward 
     preventing hazing and protecting students from harm. This 
     legislation includes several critical provisions, including a 
     requirement for colleges and universities to improve 
     transparency by reporting hazing incidents in their Annual 
     Security Reports, commonly known as Clery Reports. This step 
     will make hazing incidents more visible and hold institutions 
     accountable for how they handle hazing cases. The bill also 
     mandates the implementation of campus-wide, research-based 
     hazing prevention programs designed to address root causes of 
     hazing, equip students with the tools to intervene as 
     bystanders, and ultimately prevent these dangerous behaviors 
     before they occur.
       In addition to improving accountability and prevention, the 
     Stop Campus Hazing Act promotes transparency for students and 
     parents by requiring institutions to publicly disclose their 
     hazing prevention policies and any organizations that have 
     been found in violation of these policies. Such transparency 
     is essential for students and families to make informed 
     decisions when considering membership in campus 
     organizations. By ensuring all parties have access to this 
     vital information, we can empower students and their families 
     to make safer, more informed choices and create an 
     environment where hazing is no longer tolerated.
       This legislation is the product of years of bipartisan 
     cooperation and expert input from national campus safety 
     advocates, fraternities and sororities, and families who have 
     tragically lost loved ones to hazing. It incorporates 
     elements from two previous bills, the Report and Educate 
     About Campus Hazing (REACH) Act and END ALL Hazing Act, and 
     has been thoroughly vetted by stakeholders and experts 
     including researchers who have documented the harmful and 
     far-reaching consequences of hazing. As such, the Stop Campus 
     Hazing Act has garnered support from a broad coalition of 
     organizations dedicated to campus safety and student well-
     being.
       We commend the House Committee on Education and the 
     Workforce for advancing this important bill. It is now 
     imperative the full House considers and passes H.R. 5646 
     without delay. Doing so will send a strong message that 
     student safety is a priority and that we are committed to 
     preventing the senseless tragedies caused by hazing.
       A decades-long journey for many grieving families, H.R. 
     5646 provides an actionable framework to address hazing on 
     college campuses, and its passage will mark a significant 
     victory for student safety, educational integrity, consumer 
     protection, and prevention. We stand ready to support these 
     efforts and to work with you and your colleagues to ensure no 
     more students suffer from hazing.
       On behalf of these groups, and the students and families 
     who have endured harm and tragedy from hazing, we urge 
     Members to vote in favor of H.R. 5646 to ensure this 
     lifesaving legislation moves forward.
           Sincerely,
                                        Elizabeth J. Allan, Ph.D.,
                                            Principal, StopHazing.

                                         Anti-Hazing Coalition

                                               September 23, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Steve Scalise,
     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Katherine Clark,
     Democratic Whip, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson, Leader Scalise, Leader Jeffries, and 
     Whip Clark: On behalf of the Anti-Hazing Coalition, we write 
     in strong support of the Stop Campus Hazing Act (H.R. 5646), 
     which will be considered on the House floor this week. It is 
     fitting the House chose to consider the bill during National 
     Hazing Prevention Week when our coalition and the broader 
     higher education community make a concerted effort to raise 
     awareness and increase education about hazing.
       We are a coalition representing parents who have lost their 
     sons as a result of hazing and work closely with other 
     organizations also seeking to end all hazing on college 
     campuses. These organizations include the North American 
     Interfraternity Conference, representing 58 men's 
     fraternities; the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), 
     representing 26 women's sororities; and the Hazing Prevention 
     Network, a national nonprofit dedicated to empowering people 
     to prevent hazing.
       As a coalition, we strongly support the Stop Campus Hazing 
     Act, which is a consensus bill that incorporates provisions 
     from prior hazing-related bills from previous Congresses. The 
     bill would require institutions of higher education to 
     maintain and update biannually a page on their websites that 
     discloses student organization violations of the 
     institution's code of conduct that threaten the safety of 
     students and provide students with educational programming 
     related to hazing. As the leaders in providing anti-hazing 
     programming and education on college campuses, we believe 
     this legislation will give institutions, organizations, and 
     students the latitude to address--rather than hide--the 
     small-scale violations of the student code of conduct that, 
     if not addressed, can grow into more dangerous hazing 
     behaviors that threaten student safety.
       Passage of this important legislation is a critical 
     opportunity for Congress to show its bipartisan commitment to 
     saving the lives of our college students and its full 
     commitment to end hazing. Thank you for your leadership in 
     bringing this bill to the House floor. We hope you will do 
     everything in your power to help it become law this year.
           Sincerely,
       The Family of Harrison Kowiak (passed away on November 18,

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record 
letters of support from the Clery Center on behalf of Connie Clery and 
the Clery family, and from Safe Campuses, LLC, to support changing the 
name of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and 
Campus Crime Statistics Act to the Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act.


                                                 Clery Center,

                             Fort Washington, PA, August 27, 2024.
       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of Clery Center, Connie 
     Clery, and the Clery family, I am writing to express our 
     strong support for renaming the ``Jeanne Clery Disclosure of 
     Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act'' to 
     the ``Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act.'' We believe this 
     revised name more accurately reflects the broad scope and 
     intent of the legislation, and we urge Congress to support 
     this change.
       Since its enactment, the Clery Act has served as a 
     cornerstone in the effort to improve campus safety across the 
     United States. As a consumer protection law, it provides the 
     transparency and accountability that families and students 
     deserve. The law's requirements, which include the disclosure 
     of campus crime statistics, the implementation of safety 
     policies, and the provision of timely warnings, have 
     significantly contributed to the safety and well-being of 
     students, faculty, and staff on college campuses.
       Over the years, the Clery Act's role has expanded beyond 
     the mere disclosure of statistics and encompasses a 
     comprehensive approach to preventing and responding to crime 
     on campus. The term ``Campus Safety'' encapsulates this 
     broader mission and better communicates the law's purpose to 
     all stakeholders, including students, parents, campus 
     administrators, and law enforcement. We also believe the name 
     change will foster greater collaboration and encourage more 
     robust administrative support on campuses.
       Most importantly, this change would continue to honor 
     Jeanne Clery's legacy in a meaningful way. The tragedy that 
     befell Jeanne inspired a movement that has undoubtedly saved 
     countless lives, and this updated title would reflect the 
     ongoing impact of her legacy on campus communities 
     nationwide.
       We respectfully request that you consider supporting this 
     change. Thank you for your continued dedication to improving 
     campus safety and for your attention to this important 
     matter.
           Sincerely,

                                            Safe Campuses LLC,

     Re Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act.
                                     Thomason, GA, March 18, 2024.
     Hon. Bernie Sanders,
     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, 
         Washington, DC.
     Hon. Bill Cassidy, M.D.,
     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and 
         Pensions, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Virginia Foxx,
     Chairwoman, Committee on Education and the Workforce, 
         Washington, DC.
     Hon. Robert C. Scott,
     Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce, 
         Washington, DC.

       Dear Chairman Sanders, Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member 
     Cassidy, and Ranking Member Scott: As a social 
     entrepreneurship we work with colleges and universities to 
     create safer campuses and believe that modernizing the full 
     name of the Jeanne Clery Act, the primary federal law on this 
     subject, has the potential to help it better achieve its 
     intended goals. Updating the name to be the ``Jeanne Clery 
     Campus Safety Act'' will place the focus, as it should be, on 
     our shared goal of safer campuses rather than outdated 
     bureaucratic references.
       The current legal name the ``Jeanne Clery Disclosure of 
     Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act'', set 
     by Section 485(f)(18) of the Higher Education Act, can be an 
     impediment by placing the focus on ``security'' rather than 
     safety and on crime statistics alone. Congress has very 
     thoughtfully expanded the law to encompass a range of 
     multidisciplinary safety issues and disclosures like 
     emergency notifications that this name no longer accurately 
     reflects.
       We would ask that you please consider amending the name of 
     this landmark legislation to be the ``Jeanne Clery Campus 
     Safety Act'' as part of any higher education related measure 
     that your committees may advance. This will continue to 
     memorialize the living legacy of Jeanne Clery and help better 
     focus efforts in a way that will improve campus safety. Thank 
     you in advance for your consideration.
           Sincerely,
                                                 S. Daniel Carter,
                                                        President.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the Stop Campus Hazing Act 
addresses hazing as a campus safety issue, and updating the name is 
better reflective of that focus.
  Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to ensure that every student has 
access to a safe learning environment.
  Today, with this legislation, we ensure that students and parents 
will better understand the culture and dangers of hazing on college 
campuses. As a result, I believe that H.R. 5646 is an important step 
forward to protect the health, safety, and future of our students.
  Again, I thank Representatives McBath and Duncan for their leadership 
on this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, for far too long, the culture of hazing has permeated 
college campuses, impacting all types of student organizations. While 
some anti-hazing policies and laws are in place, more can be done to 
ensure all tools are appropriately used to deter this very dangerous 
culture.
  That is where H.R. 5646, the Stop Campus Hazing Act, comes in. It 
will improve reporting and prevention on college campuses. Simply put, 
it means ensuring students are safe.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's authors, Representative Lucy McBath 
and Representative Jeff Duncan.
  Students and their parents have advocated for this legislation. We 
have some of the families with us here today, and I would like to thank 
the families of Timothy Piazza, Max Gruver, Marquise Braham, Harrison 
Kowiak, Dalton Debrick, Collin Wiant, Justin King, George Desdunes, 
Gary DeVercelly, Jr., Sam Martinez, Gordie Bailey, Robert Champion, and 
Antonio Tsialis.
  I also thank the Clery Center, StopHazing Coalition, Anti-Hazing 
Coalition, National Panhellenic Conference, North American 
Interfraternity Conference, National Pan-Hellenic Council, SAFE 
Campuses, LLC, and dozens of other groups in support of H.R. 5646 that 
have recognized this terrible issue and worked tirelessly with Congress 
to draft this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, today is an important day for student safety. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 5646, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5490, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Mrs. Kiggans' bill, the BEACH Act, 
which would reauthorize and amend the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, or 
CBRA.
  Congress passed CBRA in 1982 to restrict the use of new Federal 
funding that may encourage development on or around certain coastal 
barriers. The intention of these restrictions is to minimize the loss 
of human life, wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage 
to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources associated with the 
coastal barriers.
  H.R. 5490 would reauthorize CBRA and codify new maps that were 
recently proposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
  In addition, H.R. 5490 makes critical reforms to the underlying CBRA 
statute that will benefit coastal home buyers. Specifically, the bill 
would require owners who are selling or leasing property in a CBRA zone 
to disclose that the property is in a CBRA zone to the buyer or lessee. 
This is a much-needed transparency measure that is long overdue.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5490, the 
Bolstering Ecosystems Against Coastal Harm Act, or BEACH Act.
  As background, the bipartisan 1982 Coastal Barrier Resources Act 
established the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System to 
identify hazard-prone coastal areas along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, 
and Great Lakes coasts where development should not be encouraged.
  The Federal Government had been subsidizing and encouraging 
development on coastal barriers, resulting in the loss of natural 
resources; threats to human life, health, and property; and the 
expenditure of millions of tax dollars each year.
  The Coastal Barrier Resources Act, or CBRA, sought to stop this cycle 
of risky investments in undeveloped areas.
  Deterring overly high levels of development on coastal barriers is 
even more critical now because, as we all should know, the climate 
crisis is upon us. These areas face increased risks from sea-level 
rise, flooding, erosion, storm surge, and more intense and frequent 
coastal storms.
  In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service started updating the CBRA 
system maps in the States affected by Hurricane Sandy: Connecticut, 
Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode 
Island, Virginia, and my home State of New York. Together, these areas 
comprise 42 percent of the total existing units and 16 percent of the 
entire current acreage of the system.
  The modernized maps correct errors affecting property owners. They 
add new qualifying areas to the system. They provide more accurate and 
accessible data for planning coastal infrastructure projects, habitat 
conservation efforts, and flood risk mitigation measures.
  The bill we are discussing today would amend CBRA by enacting the 
Hurricane Sandy maps, requiring disclosure to prospective buyers that a 
property is in the system, and clarifying Federal expenditures in 
certain areas.
  It would also direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to study how 
coastal barriers are moving and changing because of climate change, 
which will inform future work by Congress and the Service to make sure 
the Coastal Barrier Resources Act continues to protect coastal 
communities from hazards.
  The policies and language contained in the bill are the culmination 
of years of work by Republicans and Democrats in both the House and 
Senate, as well as the Fish and Wildlife Service and stakeholders. The 
text was carefully negotiated so that this bill could pass through both 
Chambers and be signed by the President before the end of this year.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend the bill's sponsors, Representative Kiggans 
and Blunt-Rochester, for their thoughtful work.
  I would like to note for the record that one provision in this 
carefully negotiated text resulted in considerable back and forth with 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is our committee's understanding, 
based on conversations with the Army Corps, that the amendment to the 
Coastal Barrier Resources Act included in section 104(1)(B) of the bill 
applies to the following four projects: one, the Townsends Inlet to 
Cape May Inlet, New Jersey project for coastal storm risk management 
and emergency response purposes; two, the Folly Beach, South Carolina, 
coastal storm risk management project; three, the Carolina Beach and 
vicinity, North Carolina coastal storm risk management project; and, 
four, the Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, coastal storm risk 
management project.
  To the best of the Corps' knowledge, no other projects would be 
included now or in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans), who is the sponsor of the bill.
  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
support of my bill, the Bolstering Ecosystems Against Coastal Harm Act, 
nicknamed the BEACH Act, after the important role it will play in 
protecting our Nation's shorelines.
  The BEACH Act would allow us to carry on the mission of the Coastal 
Barrier Resources Act.
  Signed into law by President Reagan in 1982, the Coastal Barrier 
Resources Act bans most Federal tax dollars for development on storm-
prone, ecologically sensitive coastal areas, helps conserve wildlife 
habitat, and maintains natural buffers against storms and flooding for 
coastal communities.
  Importantly, this commonsense law does not prohibit or regulate 
development by State and local governments or by private landowners. It 
simply removes the Federal taxpayer from funding coastal development in 
sensitive areas, which is a conservative, market-based approach to 
conservation.
  For 40 years, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act has not only 
protected millions of acres of beaches and wetlands along the East and 
Gulf Coasts, but it has also prevented billions of dollars in property 
damage from natural disasters like hurricanes and undoubtedly saved 
lives.
  Virginia is home to over 7,000 miles of shoreline, a large majority 
of which falls within the Second District, which I am proud to 
represent here in Congress. These coastal areas play a crucial role in 
the Commonwealth's cultural identity and economic success.
  In April 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified nearly 
100,000 new acres in Virginia to include in the Coastal Barrier 
Resources System.
  Keeping the maps in this system up to date is essential to reflect 
changes in barrier configurations, such as the ones off the coast of 
the Eastern Shore of Virginia; to identify new sensitive areas for 
inclusion; and to ensure the most effective conservation of our 
shoreline.
  I introduced the BEACH Act to approve these updated maps so we can 
make our coastal communities more resilient while maintaining fiscal 
responsibility and critical environmental protections.
  We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to take care of the 
world we live in. Responsible conservation policies like the BEACH Act 
are an important step in the right direction to accomplishing that 
goal.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope those on both sides of the aisle recognize the 
need for the BEACH Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

[[Page H5719]]

  

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, coastal barriers are important for the 
protection of coastal communities and for wildlife habitat. The BEACH 
Act balances these two needs by reauthorizing and amending CBRA to 
recognize the changes to coastal barriers that have taken place over 
time. The bill would also benefit coastal communities by providing 
much-needed transparency.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Mrs. Kiggans, for her great work 
on the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5490, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

     completing all requirements under applicable Federal laws and 
     regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act 
     of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and division A 
     of subtitle III of title 54, United States Code.
       ``(2) No new authority for federal courts.--Nothing in this 
     subsection shall be construed as modifying any existing 
     authority of a Federal court to vacate or provide injunctive 
     relief for a geothermal lease, geothermal drilling permit, 
     sundry notice, notice to proceed, right-of-way, or other 
     authorization.
       ``(3) Definition of authorization.--In this subsection, the 
     term `authorization' means any license, permit, approval, 
     finding, determination, or other administrative decision 
     issued by a Federal agency, or any interagency consultation, 
     that is required or authorized under Federal law or 
     regulations in order to site, construct, reconstruct, or 
     commence operations of a geothermal project administered by a 
     Federal agency.''.

                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 7370, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7370, the Geothermal 
Energy Opportunity Act. Geothermal power has serious potential for 
growth in this country. In fact, DOE estimates that next-generation 
geothermal technologies, like enhanced geothermal systems, could 
provide up to 90 gigawatts of reliable baseload energy by 2050.
  The best geothermal resources are located out West on Federal lands, 
and we must do all we can to ensure that bureaucratic red tape does not 
hamper the development of this resource moving forward.
  H.R. 7370, the GEO Act, introduced by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
Curtis), requires the Bureau of Land Management to process geothermal 
permits and authorizations unless a Federal court says otherwise.
  In some cases, the Biden administration has stopped processing 
permits and authorizations for geothermal and oil and gas projects 
solely because of the threat of litigation or because they have 
unilaterally decided to wait for the appearance of new information.
  Often, this delay tactic is meant to appease radical special interest 
groups who wish to stop all energy development on Federal lands and 
whose former employees have infiltrated the Department.
  Simply put, agencies should continue to move projects forward until 
they are directed otherwise by a court, and agencies should defend 
their work in court.
  Geothermal energy is becoming easier to produce every day, thanks to 
enhanced geothermal systems and the advanced methods these developers 
have borrowed from the oil and gas industry.
  We cannot allow the mere threat of frivolous litigation to hamper 
domestic energy production. This bill would address concerns voiced by 
the Bureau of Land Management during our hearing to ensure they can 
comply with existing laws.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill led by the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. Curtis), H.R. 7370, the GEO Act.
  The GEO Act would support the efficient approval of geothermal permit 
applications without sacrificing thorough review under the National 
Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National 
Historic Preservation Act.
  I thank Republicans for their willingness to work across the aisle on 
improvements to this legislation. Through this bipartisan work, we were 
able to safeguard important community protections to ensure compliance 
with Federal laws. This way, we can ensure projects are built in a way 
that is safe for the communities and the environment.
  We have also updated the timelines for approval so that we equip the 
Bureau of Land Management with adequate time to process applications. 
With these safeguards in place, this bill takes a step toward 
sustainably building a clean-energy future that centers our people and 
our planet.
  Geothermal energy will play an especially important role in this 
clean-energy future. Geothermal has the smallest footprint of any 
energy-generation technology and uses significantly fewer resources 
than other sources, especially conventional fossil fuels.
  According to the Department of Energy, geothermal uses about 1 to 8 
acres per megawatt versus 5 to 10 acres per megawatt for nuclear 
operations and 19 acres per megawatt for a coal power plant.
  Deploying more geothermal will allow us to protect strained resources 
while protecting the clean energy we know we need, and the GEO Act will 
assist in the deployment of this exciting technology by ensuring 
timeliness in permit-approval processes for geothermal energy.
  Importantly, it does so without sacrificing the holistic review of 
environmental and community impacts during the permitting process. It 
is because of this that I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from

[[Page H5720]]

Utah (Mr. Curtis), the lead sponsor of the bill.
  Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the GEO Act. Utah is 
a leader in geothermal energy, but many companies are being held back 
by the current regulatory environment.
  My bill simply requires the Department of the Interior to continue 
issuing all authorizations as long as the underlying lease remains 
unchallenged. Geothermal energy is affordable, reliable, and clean 
energy.
  After companies have invested substantial time and resources in 
obtaining permits, the Department of the Interior sometimes withholds 
notices to proceed, drilling permits, and other authorizations due to 
litigation threats against the project.
  To be clear, these pauses have occurred without any evidence of 
wrongdoing by the Department of the Interior or the operators. Instead, 
they result from unsubstantiated threats made by private organizations. 
This isn't sustainable if we want geothermal to be part of our clean-
energy future.
  The chart to my right demonstrates how important this is throughout 
the West, particularly rural parts of the West, where economic 
development can be enhanced dramatically by these projects.
  The Department of Energy projects that enhanced geothermal systems 
could contribute up to 90 gigawatts of electricity by 2050, accounting 
for almost 9 percent of U.S. energy-generation capacity.
  Utah is a case study in geothermal energy, and I was proud to support 
the establishment of Utah FORGE in southern Utah, a dedicated 
underground field laboratory sponsored by the Department of Energy 
focused on developing, testing, and accelerating geothermal 
breakthroughs.
  Mr. Speaker, the GEO Act is a critical step toward ensuring that Utah 
and the United States lead in geothermal energy and technology.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
Curtis) for working on this commonsense piece of legislation. Again, I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7370, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                    GREAT SALT LAKE STEWARDSHIP ACT

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4094) to amend the Central Utah Project Completion Act to 
authorize expenditures for the conduct of certain water conservation 
measures in the Great Salt Lake basin, and for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 4094

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Salt Lake Stewardship 
     Act''.

     SEC. 2. WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES IN THE GREAT SALT LAKE 
                   BASIN.

       Title II of the Central Utah Project Completion Act (Public 
     Law 102-575; 106 Stat. 4605) is amended by adding at the end 
     the following:

     ``SEC. 213. WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES IN THE GREAT SALT 
                   LAKE BASIN.

       ``(a) In General.-- The Secretary may use any unexpended 
     budget authority provided under subsections (a)(2) and (c) of 
     section 202 for the conduct of water conservation measures 
     within the Great Salt Lake basin in accordance with section 
     207.
       ``(b) Compliance With Definite Plan Report.--Any water 
     conservation measure conducted under subsection (a) shall be 
     considered to be compliant with the Definite Plan Report 
     completed under section 205(a).''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 4094, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation led by the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), which amends the Central Utah Project 
Completion Act.
  As we all know, the Great Salt Lake is one of Utah's most famous 
natural resources. In recent years, however, the lake levels have 
dropped to historic lows, posing a threat to the lake's ecosystem, 
local air quality, and the prosperity of surrounding communities.
  Mr. Curtis' legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior 
to use Central Utah Project funds toward new water conservation 
measures to help recover the Great Salt Lake.
  Importantly, this bill does not require any new spending 
authorizations. I thank Representative Curtis and the rest of Utah's 
congressional delegation for their leadership on this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4094, the Great Salt Lake Stewardship Act, would 
authorize expenditures and funding for water conservation measures 
within the Great Salt Lake basin.
  As drought conditions continue to worsen with climate change, the 
impacts are being felt throughout the West. One key example of the 
adverse consequences of climate change is the Great Salt Lake, which 
has been rapidly declining over the past few decades. In 2022, the lake 
reached all-time historic low water levels, presenting serious 
ecological concerns.
  The declines in the lake's water levels have threatened ecosystem 
health, disrupted bird migration, and led to concerns of exposure of 
toxic arsenic lake dust within the lake bottom, which could be carried 
out with the wind.
  The bill we are considering today seeks to address these serious 
ecological concerns by amending the Central Utah Project Completion Act 
to provide additional flexibility needed to redirect and authorize 
unexpended funds, specifically to support water conservation measures 
under the Water Management Improvement Program in the basin, and expand 
the program service area.
  The Great Salt Lake is only one example of the harms that climate 
change presents to communities and wildlife across the West. While this 
legislation is a step forward, Congress must be doing more to combat 
climate change and drought.
  This bill is a great step, and I urge my colleagues to support it, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. Curtis), the sponsor of the bill.
  Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the Great Salt Lake 
Stewardship Act.
  The Great Salt Lake is essential to the ecological and economic 
fabric of Utah. Residents have worked tirelessly to protect the lake, 
but severe drought now threatens its long-term survival.
  Recognizing this urgent challenge, the Great Salt Lake Stewardship 
Act would extend the existing Colorado River Water Conservation Program 
to include the Great Salt Lake. This would grant the Secretary of the 
Interior greater flexibility to allocate unused funds from other 
sections of the Central Utah Project Completion Act, also known as 
CUPCA, to the water conservation program.

[[Page H5721]]

  By expanding the program's geographical scope to cover the entire 
Great Salt Lake drainage basin, the bill would support State government 
of Utah, local communities, and water districts north of Salt Lake 
County in their conservation efforts to replenish the lake.
  The Great Salt Lake is a national treasure and a vital part of Utah's 
way of life. The bill demonstrates our commitment to protecting this 
valuable resource without requiring new Federal funds.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and 
I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this commonsense legislation, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 1657, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1657, the Lake 
Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2024, a bipartisan bill being led 
by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  This commonsense legislation will authorize the U.S. Forest Service 
to enter into a land exchange with the Bowen Lodge, a family-operated 
resort on the shores of Lake Winnibigoshish in northern Minnesota.
  Exchanging parcels between the Chippewa National Forest and the Bowen 
Lodge will create a win-win scenario. The lodge will gain permanent 
access to the lake, and the Forest Service will be able to reconfigure 
part of its unwieldy checkerboard pattern of land ownership.
  This change will provide excellent fishing and recreation 
opportunities for the local community and improve management 
efficiencies for the Federal Government.
  I applaud Representative Stauber for his leadership in this effort to 
improve outdoor recreation opportunities for his constituents and for 
all who have the pleasure of visiting and recreating in northern 
Minnesota. He has long been a strong advocate for responsible public 
land management and access for outdoor recreation, and this

[[Page H5722]]

legislation is an excellent reflection of that commitment.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1900

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1657, introduced by 
Representative Stauber, would authorize the U.S. Forest Service to 
exchange a parcel of Chippewa National Forest land for a parcel of land 
currently owned by the Big Winnie Land and Timber company in Minnesota.
  The Forest Service parcel is commercially zoned and already leased 
annually for the management and operation of a marina and resort, so 
the land exchange is designed to ease and simplify management.
  In exchange for the land that includes the marina, the Forest Service 
will receive a parcel that consolidates ownership in the Chippewa 
National Forest, providing for better land management of undisturbed 
sites, critical wetlands, and wildlife habitat that are currently 
adjacent to Federal lands. In turn, Big Winnie will continue management 
and operation of the marina and resort for continued visitor and 
commercial activity.
  This bill is a commonsense solution that follows the standard 
protocols for these types of transactions.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for 
working with us to incorporate feedback from the Forest Service, 
including extending the timeline to allow for the completion of the 
exchange.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the lead sponsor of this bill.
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
1657, the Lake Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2024.
  Lake Winnibigoshish, or Lake Winnie as it is also known, is located 
within the boundaries of the Chippewa National Forest and is home to 
Bowen Lodge, a premier, family-owned fishing lodge. Bowen Lodge has 
been in operation and welcoming patrons since 1925.
  For the past four decades, Bill and Gail Heig and their family have 
operated Bowen Lodge, serving as incredible stewards of Lake Winnie and 
providing incredible fishing and vacation memories for Minnesotans and 
other out-of-towners over the years.
  Currently, Bowen Lodge has a 20-year agreement with the U.S. Forest 
Service to lease 17\1/2\ acres of shoreline along the lake, where they 
operate their marina. Under the Heigs' stewardship, Lake Winnie has 
remained accessible to the citizens of Itasca County and the many 
people who visit.
  Notably, the Heigs purchased extra acreage in 2021 after an out-of-
State mega-resort developer sought to purchase a parcel of land, which 
would have changed the face of Lake Winnie forever. Now, Bowen Lodge is 
seeking to convey this extra acreage to the Chippewa National Forest.
  It is in the best interest of the public that the Forest Service take 
stewardship of this land, rather than out-of-State developers that may 
not prioritize public access for our local community.
  Additionally, this land will make it easier for the Forest Service to 
access and responsibly maintain their other acreage in the area.
  The bill before us today would facilitate the land exchange between 
Bowen Lodge and the Forest Service: 17 acres of shoreline to Bowen 
Lodge so they can continue to operate their marina in exchange for 37 
acres of nearby land to the Forest Service, which would then be added 
to the Chippewa National Forest.
  This exchange would better align proper boundaries, put the right 
acreage under the right management, and ensure Minnesotans have the 
ability to boat, fish, and enjoy beautiful Lake Winnie.
  Thanks to the Heigs' quick thinking and strong advocacy, our way of 
life will be preserved.
  I am proud that this land exchange is supported by local communities 
in Itasca County, including the local county board of supervisors that 
testified in support of the bill before the Natural Resources Committee 
last fall as well as the Mississippi Headwaters Board and other local 
environmental organizations. It is also supported by the U.S. Forest 
Service and leadership of the Chippewa National Forest.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that will 
benefit the people of northern Minnesota and our public lands. Once 
again, I applaud Representative Stauber for his work on this 
legislation.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 2468, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative Owens' bill, 
the Mountain View Corridor Completion Act.
  This legislation would expedite the completion of the Mountain View 
Corridor by transferring roughly 200 acres from the Bureau of Land 
Management to the State of Utah to complete the final segment of this 
large and urgently needed transportation project in Utah.
  Finishing the Mountain View Corridor will improve road safety and 
reduce traffic congestion, results that Utah residents will readily 
welcome.
  Over 60 percent of Utah's land is federally owned. Without these 
types of conveyances, Western States have limited land they can develop 
into the homes, schools, and roads that growing communities demand.
  H.R. 2468 is an example of Federal agencies, local stakeholders, and 
Congress successfully collaborating productively to address the 
problems of a growing population.
  I hope this kind of collaboration will continue with all Federal land 
management issues in Utah and across the West.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Owens for leading this effort, 
which will finally deliver the Mountain View Corridor to the growing 
populations of Salt Lake and Utah Counties. He worked with local 
communities and stakeholders, including the Utah Department of 
Transportation, to address this need.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2468, the Mountain View Corridor Completion Act, 
would authorize the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, to convey 
specified BLM lands south of Salt Lake City to the State of Utah to 
develop new roadways and meet the increasing travel demands of the 
surrounding area.
  The parcels of BLM land under this legislation are currently within 
the boundaries of Camp Williams, a military training center for the 
Utah National Guard, but they are not being actively used or managed by 
the BLM or the National Guard.
  Following the transfer, the Utah Department of Transportation will 
use the parcels to complete the Mountain View Corridor, a 35-mile 
highway between the State's most populous counties, Salt Lake County 
and Utah County. With these parcels, the State will develop new 
roadways to connect frontage roads and upgrade interchanges. The 
transfer of these parcels is expected to improve traffic and public 
safety for the general public and Camp Williams.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. Owens), the lead sponsor of the bill.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2468, 
the Mountain View Corridor Completion Act.
  I was pleased to introduce this legislation last year with the 
support of Utah's entire congressional delegation.
  As the Representative of the fastest growing district in the fastest 
growing State in the Union, I can tell you firsthand that our 
transportation infrastructure is under significant stress.
  Rapid growth brings with it a host of challenges, particularly in the 
Intermountain West, where over two-thirds of Utah is owned or 
controlled by various Federal agencies.
  This bill addresses one of those challenges, the need to connect our 
communities with federally owned land.
  The Utah Department of Transportation, UDOT, has anticipated 
significant population growth for decades, and over 15 years ago, they 
initiated the Mountain View Corridor project. This crucial corridor 
connects eastern Utah County with southwestern Salt Lake County and 
passes through Camp Williams, an important military training 
installation managed by the U.S. Army National Guard.
  The existing road is vital, serving as the only public access to the 
headquarters of the Utah National Guard complex and providing essential 
access to the National Security Agency's datacenter.
  While two-thirds of Mountain View Corridor has been completed, the 
final third requires UDOT to acquire three separate, irregular parcels 
of Federal land to link 36 acres currently managed by the Bureau of 
Land Management.
  However, because these parcels are situated within the boundaries of 
an active military reservation established by a 1914 executive order, 
the BLM lacks the authority to transfer this land. That is why we are 
here today.
  I am proud to report that the Utah National Guard fully supports this 
project and has collaborated extensively with UDOT and BLM to determine 
the most effective alignment for the corridor.
  This bill has already gone through a hearing and a markup in the 
House Natural Resources Committee. I am grateful for the support of my 
friend, Chairman Westerman.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation to help Utah complete 
this vital transportation project 15 years in the making.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is straightforward, commonsense 
legislation done correctly by prioritizing engagement with local 
stakeholders.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage adoption of the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2468, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

          HOLCOMBE RUCKER PARK NATIONAL COMMEMORATIVE SITE ACT

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6852) to designate Holcombe Rucker Park, in Harlem, New 
York, as a National Commemorative Site, and for other purposes, as 
amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 6852

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SEC. 2. NATIONAL COMMEMORATIVE SITE.

       (a) Designation.--Holcombe Rucker Park, in Harlem, New 
     York, is hereby designated as the ``Holcombe Rucker Park 
     National Commemorative Site'' (referred to in this section as

       (b) Administration.--
       (1) Cooperative agreements.--The Secretary of the Interior 
     may enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate public

     the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof,

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 6852, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, Representative Espaillat's bill, the Holcombe Rucker 
Park National Commemorative Site Act, will designate the historic 
Holcombe Rucker Park in New York City as a National Commemorative Site.
  Located in the heart of New York City's Harlem neighborhood, Holcombe 
Rucker Park is a historically significant basketball destination that 
has hosted legendary basketball players such as Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe 
Bryant, and LeBron James.
  Once described as the Mecca of Basketball, the park has appeared in 
many documentaries as the birthplace of streetball, a unique form of 
basketball that emphasizes creativity.
  The park's namesake, Holcombe Rucker, was a highly influential figure 
in his community, and he helped over 700 children receive college 
scholarships for athletics.
  The legislation before us today, H.R. 6852, would designate Holcombe 
Rucker Park as a National Commemorative Site. This designation would 
not affect private property rights, alter the local governance of the 
park, or make the park a unit of the National Park System. Instead, 
this bill presents a creative way to honor an important site that has 
offered generations of Harlem youth a positive outlet for sports, team 
building, and promoting racial equality.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6852, the Holcombe Rucker Park 
National Commemorative Site Act, introduced by my colleague from New 
York City, Representative Espaillat.
  Holcombe Rucker Park in Harlem is named in honor of Holcombe Rucker, 
who dedicated his life to uplifting his community in Harlem through 
compassion.
  A World War II veteran and graduate of the City College of New York, 
Mr. Rucker returned home from his military service and continued a life 
in public service as a junior high school teacher and as the playground 
director for New York City Parks at several parks in Harlem, including 
the one that now bears his name.
  During his tenure at the park, Mr. Rucker not only served as a mentor 
for the community's youth but was actively engaged in empowering them. 
He established a youth basketball league to help kids build life skills 
and to keep them out of trouble in the summer, back at a time when 
naysayers told him it would never work because basketball was 
supposedly just a winter sport.

                              {time}  1915

  The program was a success. Mr. Rucker held popular, now-legendary 
tournaments at the park which became the Rucker Tournament. His efforts 
turned this neighborhood site into what The New York Times has called a 
``Street Basketball Mecca.''
  Using the increased visibility, Mr. Rucker went even further and 
worked to help secure hundreds of college scholarships for the youths 
he mentored.
  Through the establishment of the Rucker Tournament, Mr. Rucker paved 
the way for future generations of basketball players to grow and build 
their skills in Harlem and Washington Heights. Many of the players who 
participated in his tournaments went on to play in the NBA and became 
legendary players in their own right. The park was renamed in his honor 
in 1974 and is often affectionately called just ``the Rucker.''
  My friend Mr. Espaillat's bill would recognize the iconic Holcombe 
Rucker Park and its historical significance in Harlem and around the 
world by designating it as the Holcombe Rucker Park National 
Commemorative Site.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), the sponsor of the bill 
and my friend, colleague, and fellow New Yorker.
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking Chairman Bruce 
Westerman, Ranking Member Raul Grijalva, and of course, the gentlewoman 
from New York, my colleague, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, subcommittee 
Chairman Tom Tiffany, and subcommittee Ranking Member   Joe Neguse for 
their leadership on this important matter.
  Assistant Minority Leader   Joe Neguse went to Rucker Park, and he 
shot a mean three-pointer. In fact, he earned the name ``Let It Fly,''  
 Joe Neguse, over the summer.
  I also acknowledge the families and community leaders who have 
championed this cause: the Rucker family, the Marius family, the 
McCullough family, Bobby Hunter, who was here in one of the hearings, a 
Harlem Globetrotter, Freddie Crawford, 155 Entertainers LLC, and so 
many from Harlem, including Manhattan Community Board 10 Parks Chair 
Horry. I thank them for their unwavering support and dedication in 
preserving Holcombe Rucker Park's legacy.
  Today, I rise in support of H.R. 6852, the Holcombe Rucker Park 
National Commemorative Site Act. This legislation is more than just a 
symbolic gesture. It is a commitment to recognizing the historical and 
cultural significance of one of Harlem's most cherished landmarks.
  In the 1950s, Holcombe Rucker, a World War II veteran and a scholar, 
had a vision for Harlem's youth. He sought to create a space where 
children of the Harlem community could find refuge from the street, a 
space that could not only showcase their athletic talents but also push 
young people toward higher education and economic mobility.
  The Rucker Pro League was not just about basketball. It was about 
giving back and about mentorship, about lifting each other up.
  The ``Each One Teach One'' program was Rucker's mantra, a motto that 
resulted in over 700 scholarships for young athletes.
  Through his leadership, Rucker transformed the lives of hundreds, 
instilling in them the importance of academic achievement and community 
service.
  This park has become a cultural institution where the worlds of 
sports, music, and education converge.
  A generation of athletes like Julius ``Dr. J'' Erving, Kobe Bryant, 
and LeBron James have graced the court.
  Beyond the fame, the real legacy of Rucker Park is in the 
scholarships, the mentorship, and the opportunities of upward mobility 
it has created for Harlem's youth.
  The bill we are considering tonight will grant Federal recognition to 
Holcombe Rucker Park, helping to preserve this sacred space for future 
generations.
  It ensures that Rucker's commitment to academic excellence, 
mentorship, and community empowerment is enshrined in our Nation's 
history. The recognition will highlight its historical significance and 
ensure its legacy is preserved.

[[Page H5725]]

  In closing, let me emphasize that this bill isn't just about a 
historical basketball court. It is about honoring a man who used 
basketball as a tool for social change, for empowering young people, 
and for building a brighter future for his community. It is about 
continuing the legacy of resilience and empowerment that Holcombe 
Rucker started decades ago.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6852. Let's honor the 
history, the culture, and the transformative impact of Holcombe Rucker 
Park.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank Representative 
Espaillat for his work on this bill, which honors an important landmark 
without adding to the Federal estate or using taxpayer resources.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6852, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

            CONTINUED RAPID OHIA DEATH RESPONSE ACT OF 2023

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1726) to require the Secretary of the Interior to partner 
and collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture and the State of 
Hawaii to address Rapid Ohia Death, and for other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 1726

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Continued Rapid Ohia Death 
     Response Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

       In this Act:
       (1) Rapid ohia death.--The term ``Rapid Ohia Death'' means 
     the disease caused by the fungal pathogen known as 
     Ceratocystis fimbriata that affects the tree of the species 
     Metrosideros polymorpha.
       (2) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of Hawaii.

     SEC. 3. COLLABORATION.

       The Secretary of the Interior shall partner and collaborate 
     with the Secretary of Agriculture and the State to address 
     Rapid Ohia Death.

     SEC. 4. SUSTAINED EFFORTS.

       (a) Transmission.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting 
     through the Director of the United States Geological Survey, 
     and the Chief of the Forest Service, acting through the 
     Forest Service Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, shall 
     continue to conduct research on Rapid Ohia Death vectors and 
     transmission.
       (b) Ungulate Management.--The Secretary of the Interior, 
     acting through the Director of the United States Fish and 
     Wildlife Service, shall continue to partner with the 
     Secretary of Agriculture, the State, and with local

     the Secretary of the Interior--
       (A) to prevent the spread of Rapid Ohia Death; and
       (B) to restore the native forests of the State; and
       (2) staff and necessary infrastructure funding to the 
     Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry to conduct research on 
     Rapid Ohia Death.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
on H.R. 1726, the bill now under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, Representative Tokuda's legislation, the Continued Rapid 
Ohia Death Response Act, directs the Secretary of the Interior to 
partner and collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture and the State 
of Hawaii to address rapid ohia death.
  Rapid ohia death is a fungal disease that has devastated Hawaii's 
ohia tree population. The ohia tree is important ecologically and 
culturally to Hawaii. Ohias regulate water flow and help prevent soil 
erosion. The continued loss of ohia trees can have significant economic 
impacts, including the loss of tourism revenue and increased water 
treatment and erosion control cost. Unfortunately, there is currently 
no cure that can help the affected trees.
  H.R. 1726 would help address rapid ohia death by focusing Federal and 
State agencies' efforts on detection, prevention, and restoration 
efforts for combating this disease.
  I recognize Representative Tokuda for her work on this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

                                         House of Representatives,


                                     Committee on Agriculture,

                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2023.
     Hon. Bruce Westerman,
     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,
     Washington, DC,
       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual 
     understanding regarding H.R. 1726, the ``Continued Rapid Ohia 
     Death Response Act of 2023''. Thank you for collaborating 
     with the Committee on Agriculture on the matters within our 
     jurisdiction.
       The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further 
     consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing 
     consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction 
     over any subject matter contained in this or similar 
     legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the 
     right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of 
     conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support 
     such a request.
       We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming 
     this understanding with respect to H.R. 1726 and request a 
     copy of our letters on this matter be published in the 
     Congressional Record during Floor consideration.
           Sincerely,

                                  ____

                                         House of Representatives,


                               Committee on Natural Resources,

                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2023.
     Hon. Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,
     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 1726, the 
     ``Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2023,'' which 
     was ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources on 
     June 21, 2023.
       I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall 
     within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and 
     appreciate your willingness to forgo any further 
     consideration of the bill. I acknowledge that the Committee 
     on Agriculture will not formally consider H.R. 1726 and agree 
     that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill 
     does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter 
     contained therein.
       I am pleased to support your request to name members of the 
     Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to 
     consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of 
     letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor 
     consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation 
     regarding this legislation.
           Sincerely,

                                              Bruce Westerman,

                                                         Chairman,
                                   Committee on Natural Resources.

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1726, the 
Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2023, introduced by my 
colleague from Hawaii, Representative Jill Tokuda.
  This vital legislation addresses the urgent need to combat rapid ohia 
death, or ROD, which has already led to the loss of over 1 million 
native ohia lehua trees in Hawaii since its discovery in 2014.
  The significance of these trees cannot be overstated. They are 
Hawaii's most abundant native trees and play a crucial role in 
preserving the State's unique biodiversity and protecting its 
ecosystems.
  It is essential that we take immediate action to prevent further 
devastation and ensure the survival of this iconic species.
  This bill emphasizes the need for research and aid to enhance our 
understanding of this deadly fungus and explore innovative solutions to 
combat its impact.
  Furthermore, the bill fosters collaboration between Federal agencies, 
the State of Hawaii, and local stakeholders.

[[Page H5726]]

  The comprehensive approach will help mitigate the threat of ROD and 
protect Hawaii's native forests and ecosystems, so that we can 
safeguard Hawaii's ohia trees for future generations and preserve the 
unique ecosystems and rich biodiversity that make our Nation so 
exceptional.
  I commend my colleague, Representative Tokuda, for championing this 
important legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this 
bill and reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and 
I am prepared to close. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda), the sponsor of the bill.
  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1726, 
the Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2023.
  Ohia lehua trees form the backbone of Hawaii's forests and 
watersheds. It is the first tree that you will see spring up from a 
recent lava flow.
  It grows from the sea level to 8,000 feet, and it protects our 
communities by literally keeping our mountains from eroding.
  Ohia lehua also provides critical habitat for Hawaii's federally 
endangered forest birds and many other species.
  They are what you call a keystone species in Hawaii's forests, and 
its catastrophic decline has the potential to cause major ecosystem 
imbalances that would impact watersheds, cultural traditions, natural 
resources, and the safety and quality of life of our people.
  Because of this vital role they play in maintaining Hawaii's forest 
canopies and watersheds, rapid ohia death, or ROD, poses a lethal 
threat to the ecological balance and everyday life in our islands.
  Initially reported in 2010, ROD has already spread to tens of 
thousands of acres and killed over a million trees on Hawaii island 
alone.
  Large swaths of dead ohia trees pose a fire risk and a danger and are 
more prone to habitat-modifying noxious weeds and trees like miconia 
and strawberry guava, all of which are known to greatly impact 
watershed health and alter ecosystem function.
  Despite efforts to contain the spread of ROD to Hawaii island through 
restrictions on the movement of plant material and increased sanitation 
protocols, ROD has now been found on the islands of Oahu, Kauai, and 
Maui.
  Because there is no known cure for ROD, it has the potential to kill 
off ohia trees statewide and devastate our precious island ecosystems.
  While ROD creates acres of deadly fire fuel with its dry and dead 
trees and poses a critical threat to our native birds, our native 
forests, watersheds, critically endangered forest birds, and I should 
note, natural beauty, support for combating ROD has been extremely 
limited.
  For example, the Lyon Arboretum, a local research facility on Oahu, 
relied on funding through a GoFundMe campaign to further the vital seed 
banking of ohia lehua.
  My bill, the Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act, seeks to 
address ROD and the urgent threat it presents.
  The bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to partner and 
collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture and the State of Hawaii 
to address ROD. It also supports ongoing detection, prevention, and 
restoration efforts to combat rapid ohia death.
  I thank Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member Grijalva, and especially 
Federal lands Ranking Member Neguse and his staff for their support and 
assistance on this bill.
  We cannot stand alone, and we cannot lose our native forests in 
Hawaii. It protects and sustains our people and provides critical 
habitat for native species.
  This bill is essential in turning the tide in the fight against rapid 
ohia death and protecting and preserving ohia lehua and Hawaii's unique 
ecosystems for our future generations.
  I thank again all who have supported it, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ``yes''.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the ohia tree is important to Hawaii's 
ecosystem, people, and the economy. This legislation will help focus 
Federal and State resources on conserving one of the most important 
tree species in Hawaii.
  Mr. Speaker, I recognize and support my colleague Ms. Tokuda's work 
on this issue, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1726, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

             GEOTHERMAL COST-RECOVERY AUTHORITY ACT OF 2024

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7422) to amend the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to provide 
cost-recovery authority for the Department of the Interior, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7422

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Cost-Recovery 
     Authority Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. COST RECOVERY FROM GEOTHERMAL LEASING, PERMITTING, 
                   AND INSPECTIONS.

       Section 6 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 
     1005) is amended by adding at the end the following:
       ``(j) Cost Recovery.--
       ``(1) In general.--During the period that begins on the 
     date of enactment of this subsection and ends September 30, 
     2031, the Secretary may require an applicant for, or a holder 
     of, a geothermal lease to reimburse the United States for all 
     reasonable administrative and other costs incurred by the 
     United States from--
       ``(A) processing the application for the geothermal lease, 
     including any application for an operations plan, geothermal 
     drilling permit, utilization plan, site license, facility 
     construction permit, commercial use permit, and any other 
     approval associated with a geothermal lease; and
       ``(B) inspecting and monitoring--
       ``(i) geophysical exploration activities;
       ``(ii) the drilling, plugging, and abandonment of wells; 
     and
       ``(iii) the construction, operation, termination, and 
     reclamation of any well site or facility for the utilization 
     of geothermal resources pursuant to the geothermal lease.
       ``(2) Considerations.--In determining whether to require 
     reimbursement under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
     consider whether there is in existence a cooperative cost 
     share agreement between the United States and the holder of a 
     geothermal lease.
       ``(3) Adjustments.--The Secretary may reduce the amount to 
     be reimbursed under paragraph (1) if the Secretary 
     determines--
       ``(A) that full reimbursement would impose an economic 
     hardship on the applicant; or
       ``(B) that a less than full reimbursement is necessary to 
     promote the greatest use of geothermal resources.
       ``(4) Use.--The amounts reimbursed under this subsection 
     shall be credited to the currently applicable appropriation, 
     account, or fund of the Department of the Interior as 
     discretionary offsetting collections, and shall be available 
     only to the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts 
     for--
       ``(A) processing the application for geothermal leases, 
     including any application for operations plans, geothermal 
     drilling permits, utilization plans, site licenses, facility 
     construction permits, commercial use permits, and any other 
     approval associated with geothermal leases; and
       ``(B) inspecting and monitoring--
       ``(i) geophysical exploration activities;
       ``(ii) the drilling, plugging, and abandonment of wells; 
     and
       ``(iii) the construction, operation, termination, and 
     reclamation of any well site or facility for the utilization 
     of geothermal resources pursuant to geothermal leases.''.

     SEC. 3. REPORT.

       (a) Report.--Not later than 5 years after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, in 
     consultation with the geothermal industry and other 
     stakeholders, shall submit to the Committee on Natural 
     Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
     on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, and make 
     publicly available on the website of the Department of the 
     Interior, a report that includes--
       (1) an assessment of how the amendments made by section 2 
     of this Act affected the Bureau of Land Management's 
     geothermal program;
       (2) any recommendations for reauthorization of section 6(j) 
     of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as added by this Act; 
     and

[[Page H5727]]

       (3) any other recommendations for updates to such section 
     and the Bureau of Land Management's geothermal program.
       (b) Considerations.--In developing the report required in 
     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall solicit 
     facts or information from the geothermal industry and other 
     stakeholders.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 7422, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  H.R. 7422, the Geothermal Cost Recovery Authority Act of 2024 grants 
the Department of the Interior the authority to impose fees on 
geothermal leaseholders. The fees would cover costs related to 
geothermal lease applications, production and development plans, site 
licenses, permits, and approvals, as well as inspection and monitoring 
activities.
  In 2022, BLM updated its regulations and created new geothermal cost 
recovery fees but did not include a fee for geothermal permits to 
drill. BLM argued that there is no mechanism under FLPMA to charge cost 
recovery fees for geothermal facilities like there is for wind and 
solar.
  This bill would provide DOI with explicit authority to charge 
geothermal leaseholder fees to recover costs for geothermal lease 
applications and other approvals associated with exploration, drilling, 
construction, and operation of well sites.
  As we have seen in the past, agencies have blamed slow permitting 
processes on a lack of funding. However, when Congress provided 
additional funding, permitting timelines did not improve, and taxpayer 
dollars were squandered.
  I appreciate the changes made to the bill during the committee 
process to ensure fees charged under the legislation will be used 
explicitly for geothermal permitting. Reporting language was also 
included to better enable Congress to ensure these funds are used 
appropriately.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 7422, the Geothermal Cost Recovery 
Authority Act of 2024. As colleagues on both sides of the aisle can 
agree, geothermal energy is an extremely promising and growing source 
of renewable energy.
  Since the 1960s, geothermal energy has been used as a sustainable and 
reliable source of electricity, but even though it has grown 
significantly since then, it still only makes up less than half of one 
percent of our energy generation mix.
  Fortunately, new breakthroughs in technology are massively expanding 
where geothermal energy can be developed. This is particularly exciting 
because of some of the unique benefits of geothermal energy for the 
clean energy transition.
  Geothermal provides consistent baseload power, which is available 24/
7 with minimal emissions. This complements the mix of solar, wind, and 
storage needed to build a clean grid and is crucial for maintaining 
stability in our energy systems, replacing dirty baseload energy like 
coal.
  Many of the skills needed for geothermal development are directly 
transferrable from industries like oil and gas. As geothermal 
technologies advance, we will be able to site those power plants at 
places like retired coal plants where fossil fuel workers can find 
jobs.
  Better yet, many of these fossil trades are already organized and 
unionized. Everyone from the laborers to the workers in the power plant 
control rooms, to the steamfitters, pipefitters, and operating 
engineers can find work in geothermal. Geothermal shows truly exciting 
promise to help union workers transition to a clean energy economy.
  As all this growth occurs, the Federal Government will also have an 
important role to play. The Department of Energy is supporting pilot 
projects and advancements in technology. Within the jurisdiction of the 
Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee, where I serve as ranking 
member, the Department of the Interior is often in charge of 
permitting.
  In fact, the first renewable energy project sited on U.S. public 
lands back in 1978 was geothermal energy. Right now, nearly 70 percent 
of geothermal energy capacity is on federally managed Bureau of Land 
Management lands.
  With the technological advancements we are seeing now, the Bureau of 
Land Management needs to be ready to scale up the deployment of this 
clean energy while remaining diligent about permitting 
responsibly, considering public input and respecting indigenous 
knowledge and Tribal consultation.

  We have heard from geothermal developers that there can be challenges 
when it comes to permitting new geothermal plants. Much of that stems 
from capacity constraints, the need for more expertise or more staff in 
the right locations.
  My bill, the Geothermal Cost Recovery Authority Act of 2024, will 
allow BLM the flexibility to charge companies cost recovery for things 
like inspections and monitoring, and my bill will enable BLM to hire 
third-party experts to help review permit applications. This 
flexibility will improve permitting capacity and timelines without 
sacrificing any of the important steps for environmental review and 
community input.
  At a time when permitting is a contentious word in Washington, this 
bill shows both parties can come together around commonsense approaches 
to advance commonsense solutions.
  I greatly appreciate my colleagues across the aisle who worked with 
us on the language in my bill, and I am excited to see it moving 
forward today, along with other positive bills for geothermal energy, 
like Congressman Curtis' GEO Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as part of an all-of-the-above approach 
to energy security, geothermal energy has great potential to help meet 
the United States' growing energy demands.
  I appreciate Ms. Ocasio-Cortez' work with my team to address concerns 
raised about H.R. 7422 during the committee's hearing and markup 
process. I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moore of Utah). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7422, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 2950, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Representative Huffman's bill, the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act 
of 2023, congressionally authorizes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's Coastal Program.
  The Coastal Program was administratively created in 1984 and annually 
receives appropriations even though it has never been statutorily 
authorized. H.R. 2950 would address this currently unauthorized program 
and ensure that the Committee on Natural Resources has increased 
oversight.
  Importantly, it would better enable the Committee on Natural 
Resources to make substantive changes to how the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service administers the program should those changes be necessary.
  The Coastal Program is a voluntary, partnership-based program that 
allows the Service to provide technical and financial assistance for 
habitat conservation in coastal watersheds. The committee has heard 
testimony that outlined the successes of this program, which has 
conserved nearly 3 million acres of priority habitat nationwide.
  The bill brings greater congressional oversight over an important 
program for coastal habitat conservation. I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise in support of H.R. 2950, the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act, 
introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), the Water, 
Wildlife and Fisheries Subcommittee ranking member.
  This bill would provide statutory authority for the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service's Coastal Program, including authorizing nearly $17 
million each year from fiscal year 2024 through 2028.
  The Coastal Program is one of the Fish and Wildlife Service's most 
effective voluntary programs for restoring and protecting the habitat. 
It has helped coastal communities and their partners conserve and 
restore coastal ecosystems since 1985. These partnerships have 
benefited people, habitats, and wildlife in 24 priority coastal areas, 
including the Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, Caribbean, Atlantic Ocean, 
and the Pacific Ocean.

[[Page H5729]]

  The program works to create resilient coastal ecosystems, support 
habitat connectivity, recover Federal trust in priority species, and 
promote community stewardship of fish and wildlife resources. It does 
so by providing both technical and financial assistance to States, 
Tribes, coastal communities, and conservation organizations for public 
and private lands.
  This successful program has completed nearly 5,000 projects and 
collaborated with over 6,400 partners, with the outcome of protecting 
more than 2.3 million acres of habitat and improving land and water for 
the people and wildlife that live there.
  Our country and our planet are facing a climate crisis and a 
biodiversity crisis, so efforts like these are essential.
  Authorizing the Coastal Program through H.R. 2950 will enable the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to continue identifying threats to 
coastal landscapes, providing coastal habitat planning and assessments, 
ensuring restoration and protection for resilient coastlines, and 
developing capacity building between private and public partnerships.
  I strongly support the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act and urge my 
colleagues to pass this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).
  Mrs. GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2950, the 
Coastal Habitat Conservation Act. I was proud to join Congressman 
Huffman as the co-lead on this bipartisan bill, which would 
congressionally authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal 
Program.
  This program is one of the Service's most effective and proven 
initiatives, bringing together public and private partners on a 
voluntary basis to protect and improve coastal habitats and ecosystems 
across our Nation. These efforts are carried out throughout 24 priority 
coastal areas along the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of 
Mexico, the Great Lakes, and of course, the Caribbean.
  In 2023, the Coastal Program worked with partners and local 
communities to implement 153 conservation projects across 19 States and 
territories, restoring and protecting more than 87,000 acres. This was 
accomplished by leveraging $3 in partners' contributions for every 
Federal dollar invested in the program.
  In the case of Puerto Rico, we have seen firsthand the success and 
the impact of this program. Between 2010 and 2021, the Coastal Program 
supported 218 voluntary-based projects on the island, which contributed 
to the restoration of almost 2,900 acres of habitat. These include 
projects to restore coastal dunes, wetlands, and mangrove forests. It 
also supported partnerships with local farmers to convert sun-grown 
coffee farms into shade-grown coffee farms which help protect streams 
and coral reefs by reducing sources of sediment and nutrient pollution.
  I trust that formally authorizing the Coastal Program, as H.R. 2950 
seeks to do, will ensure it has the necessary tools to continue 
supporting similar locally driven conservation projects across our 
Nation, coastal States, and of course territories.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2950.

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), the sponsor of this 
bill.
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York and 
thank my colleagues for understanding the importance of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service's Coastal Program and for supporting this legislation 
to, for the first time, authorize it in statute.
  Coastal conservation is not just about protecting our environment. It 
is about supporting a thriving economy. However, we do face serious 
threats--climate change, pollution, unsustainable development, and 
other threats--to our coastal habitats, causing rapid deterioration of 
these critical resources.
  I want to be very clear: This is not a local issue. Over 53 percent 
of the United States population lives near coastal watersheds. These 
areas are home to 45 percent of federally listed threatened and 
endangered species. Over 60 million American jobs depend on the health 
of our coasts.
  These coastal habitats are complex, dynamic, and they don't always 
fit neatly within the boundaries that often guide our conservation 
work. The Service's Coastal Program recognizes this, and it allows for 
management flexibility by providing technical and financial assistance 
for coastal land acquisitions. This helps the Service strategically 
conserve coastal habitat beyond the confines of the National Wildlife 
Refuge System.

                              {time}  1945

  The Coastal Program has a great record of success. Since its 
inception in Chesapeake Bay in 1985, the program has expanded to 23 
other priority coastal areas along the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and 
in the Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and the Caribbean, including 
wetlands, estuaries, beaches, and mangrove forests.
  Within these areas, the Service facilitates a voluntary, partnership-
based relationship with coastal communities to conserve and restore 
coastal ecosystems and benefit fish, wildlife, and people alike.
  While the Coastal Program is designed to help conserve and recover 
priority habitat in coastal areas, it can only be effective with 
adequate resources. That is why the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act of 
2023 provides statutory authority to the program by authorizing $16.9 
million annually over the next 5 fiscal years.
  I am pleased that we are here supporting efforts to bring together 
people and private partners to voluntarily protect and improve coastal 
habitats. This is an approach that helps strike a balance between 
working landscapes and habitat conservation in our coastal communities.
  With this bipartisan bill, we can ensure that this great program will 
continue to drive locally led conservation projects across coastal 
States and territories, preserving the health and resilience of coastal 
habitats to benefit the wildlife communities and economies that depend 
on them for generations to come.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2950 authorizes the Coastal Program in a fiscally 
responsible manner and provides for increased congressional oversight 
and direction of the program.
  By doing so, we, as Members of Congress, will be better able to 
fulfill our oversight responsibilities. At the same time, this program 
continues its work conserving coastal ecosystems for the benefit of 
species and our constituents.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2950, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                ELECTRONIC PERMITTING MODERNIZATION ACT

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5509) to modernize permitting systems at the Department of 
the Interior, and for other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 5509

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Permitting 
     Modernization Act''.

     SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR PERMIT ACCESSIBILITY.

       (a) In General.--In order to improve the overall economy, 
     efficiency, and management of operations and activities of 
     the Department of the Interior (referred to in this section 
     as the ``Department''), reduce paperwork, and provide high-
     quality services and access to the public, the Secretary of 
     the Interior shall, to the extent practicable--

[[Page H5730]]

       (1) design and deliver modernized electronic permitting 
     systems to accept, process, and record applications 
     (including plan submissions, payment activity, and other 
     related correspondence) for permits, forms, and other 
     paperwork required for activities regulated by the 
     Department;
       (2) provide a centralized electronic permitting system 
     online repository, available to the public on the 
     Department's website, that includes--
       (A) hyperlinks to facilitate navigation to all Department 
     electronic permitting systems; and
       (B) with respect to permits, the contact information for 
     the appropriate Department employees providing assistance to 
     State, Tribal, and local governments; and
       (3) provide to the Committee on Natural Resources of the 
     House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and 
     Natural Resources of the Senate periodic updates on the 
     implementation of paragraphs (1) and (2).
       (b) Disclosure of Information Prohibited.--No information 
     described in section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, 
     or protected from disclosure by another law of the United 
     States shall be disclosed under this Act.
       (c) Duplication of Systems Not Permitted.--No system shall 
     be duplicated under this Act.
       (d) Consultation.--In developing the permitting systems 
     required under section 2 of this Act, the Secretary of the 
     Interior shall consult with States, local governments, Indian 
     Tribes and other stakeholders who apply for agency permits 
     and will use the permitting systems.

     SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE 
                   FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2023.

        In developing the permitting systems required under 
     section 2 of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall 
     ensure that the Department's electronic permitting systems 
     are consistent with the priorities identified in section 110 
     of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
     4336d) with respect to any permit that requires review under 
     that Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 5509, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, Representative Porter's bipartisan legislation directs 
the Secretary of the Interior to design and deliver electronic 
permitting systems for permits, forms, and other required paperwork to 
the extent practical.
  Republicans have long supported streamlining and simplifying the 
permitting process. Additionally, the minority worked with us to 
address a concern raised with the legislation and how it would interact 
with recent changes to NEPA enacted under the Fiscal Responsibility 
Act.
  These discussions led to changes to Ms. Porter's legislation to 
clarify that any permitting system related to NEPA be consistent with 
the priorities identified in the FRA's NEPA provision.
  This legislation aims to streamline the management of operations of 
the Department of the Interior, improving access to our public lands 
and Department facilities.
  Modernizing the permitting process is an overdue task needed to 
increase departmental efficiency and improve transparency.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague Representative 
Porter's bill, the Electronic Permitting Modernization Act.
  This legislation would codify parts of a Biden executive order that 
improves the navigability of the Federal Government's permitting 
process, and the bill would require the Department of the Interior to 
design and deliver a modernized electronic permitting system.
  Permitting reform has been a popular topic this Congress in the 
Committee on Natural Resources, and on this topic, it is rare that we 
can achieve a bipartisan win, but we can all be for bringing the 
Federal permitting system into the 21st century.
  That is why this bill would require the Department of the Interior to 
provide a centralized online repository on its website for public 
access to its electronic permitting system. It would also make easily 
available the contact information of the appropriate Department of the 
Interior employees who can assist State, Tribal, and local governments 
with permit applications.
  These changes will make the lives of our constituents easier by 
simplifying the process of applying for a permit.
  We know that we can make permitting more efficient. We can speed up 
processing times, and we can improve transparency for everyone 
involved, all without sacrificing community engagement or environmental 
protections.
  From my district in the Bronx and Queens to across the American West, 
Americans are all too familiar with the legacy of sacrifice zones. 
Having online options for DOI permits is a commonsense solution to a 
part of an important issue that we all care about.
  This bill also requires the Department of the Interior to provide 
periodic updates to the House Committee on Natural Resources, which 
will allow us to continue to monitor and upgrade our permitting 
processes.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Representative Porter's Electronic 
Permitting Modernization Act, and I urge the House to approve it.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa).
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the effort of my colleague 
from the OC in bringing this forward.
  Really, it is about simplicity. It is about streamlining a process 
for people who are just seeking to engage in a process that requires 
paperwork, permits, and forms. Why would we not make that easier for 
them?
  With all the different interests and needs that we could have, 
especially in our rural lands--parks, public lands, and the 
recreational users of those--the Electronic Permitting Modernization 
Act creates a simple online website to get and complete any necessary 
permits.
  On the other hand, when businesses are interested in raising, 
logging, mining, or anything else, they will be able to find any 
approval documents or applications on a single web page, one-stop 
shopping.
  I am happy that we can make it a little bit easier because, for my 
farming business and me, sometimes it is hard to get to the forms you 
need and get the stuff done. That is frustrating because all you want 
to do is get back to what you are doing there to begin with.
  This bill actually builds off some of the work we completed last year 
with the Fiscal Responsibility Act by further directing Federal 
agencies under the Department of the Interior to provide electronic 
means to complete any required documentation.
  This is a good step to make it simpler to get the work done. I hope 
it is not an excuse to create more permits and more paperwork, but this 
is a great way to help out with people who are just seeking to get 
their work done.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5509, and I 
appreciate the bipartisan effort on this.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter), the sponsor of the 
bill.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, or 
Independent, we all benefit when the government works the way it is 
supposed to.
  A 21st century nation deserves a 21st century government. The problem 
is too many Federal agencies still rely on outdated systems not 
designed for the people they serve. This leaves people looking for help 
stuck in a tangled web of confusing application processes, clunky 
government websites, and poor customer support. Long delays and 
processing times often follow, adding to the frustration our 
constituents feel.
  It is why so many of them turn to us, their Member of Congress, for 
help. Our casework teams work hard every day to cut through the red 
tape, but it shouldn't have to come to that.
  When we fail to modernize our way of government, we are wasting tax 
dollars

[[Page H5731]]

on inefficiency, but there is something we can do today with this bill 
to make government applications easier to find and simpler to submit 
and process.
  Congress can pass the Electronic Permitting Modernization Act, which 
I lead with my good friend across the aisle, Representative Doug 
LaMalfa.
  This commonsense bill encourages the Department of the Interior to 
offer an online option for as many of its permits as possible. It 
creates a web page where our constituents can find links to the 
Department's online permits. Then, it would task the Department of the 
Interior to report back to Congress periodically on its progress toward 
electronic permitting.
  These simple steps are no-brainers, but they are necessary to keep 
our government on track and to make the permitting process work for all 
users.
  Creating an online option for more permits will make permitting 
easier for everyone, not just the applicant. It will reduce the amount 
of paperwork mailed to the agency, speed up processing times, and 
finally help bring our government into the 21st century.
  At the same time, this bill would help Congress hold the Department 
of the Interior accountable for its work. With this bill, we could more 
easily see which bureaus are getting things done here with us in the 
21st century and which bureaus are still having workers sitting in 
windowless rooms, opening envelopes with paper checks and forms in 
triplicate.
  What matters the most about this bill is that it improves the daily 
lives of the people we serve.
  Look, I am a single mom with three kids. When your life is anything 
like mine, you just want things that you expect to be easy to actually 
be easy. Let's be clear: It should be easy to find and apply for a 
permit to comply with the law.
  Let's simplify people's lives just a little bit. Let's show them that 
this part of government using their public lands works efficiently.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my co-lead, Representative LaMalfa, as 
well as Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member Grijalva, and their staff 
for their work on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Electronic 
Permitting Modernization Act.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is long overdue in 
doing the work needed to bring its permitting processes into the 21st 
century. The bill before us instructs the Secretary to create an 
electronic permitting system to accept, process, and record 
applications for any permitting process under the Department's 
jurisdiction.
  Mr. Speaker, even though the gentlewoman from California opposed my 
commonsense, straightforward forestry bill earlier today, I do 
recognize, commend, and support Representative Porter for her work on 
this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5509, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 4596, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Boebert's bill, the 
Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins Endangered Fish Recovery 
Programs Reauthorization Act of 2024.
  The Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins endangered fish recovery 
programs provide Endangered Species Act compliance for over 2,500 water 
and hydroelectric power projects.
  Without these recovery programs, projects would be open to litigation 
and disruptions to operations that would negatively impact millions of 
Americans' water and power supplies.
  These programs have been a conservation success story. Their goal is 
to recover four ESA-listed fish species: the Colorado pikeminnow, the 
razorback sucker, the humpback chub, and the bonytail. Yet, they also 
allow for the continuation of operations to meet current and future 
needs.
  In recent years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recognized 
the program's success by reclassifying the humpback chump from an 
endangered species to a threatened species.

                              {time}  2000

  This service has also proposed to reclassify the razorback sucker 
from an endangered species to a threatened species.
  In a report submitted to Congress in March of 2023, the service 
stated: ``When the recovery programs were initiated in 1988 and 1992, 
the trajectory of all four listed species was toward extinction. The 
implementation of these recovery elements not only prevented 
extinctions, but substantially improved the prospect for recovering the 
listed fishes.'' This is a rare occurrence and should be celebrated.
  I urge my colleagues to allow this success to continue by supporting 
this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4596, the Upper Colorado and 
San Juan River Basins Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Reauthorization 
Act.
  This bill would reauthorize two fish recovery programs in the 
Colorado River Basin: the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery 
Program, and the San Juan River Basin Implementation Program.
  The Colorado River is known as the hardest working river in the West, 
supporting a multitude of uses, including irrigation, municipal water 
use, recreation, and sustaining numerous fish and wildlife species.
  Established in the late eighties and early nineties, these two fish 
recovery programs allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to partner with 
other Federal agencies, States, Tribes, and hydropower customers, water 
users, and conservation groups to work collaboratively on species 
recovery and ensure water-related projects are in compliance with the 
Endangered Species Act.
  Without this reauthorization, these two programs will expire, and we 
risk the long history of collaboration and successful recovery of four 
native fish species. We need to get this done as soon as possible.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. Boebert), the lead sponsor of this bill.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support, and 
I appreciate the bipartisan support here in the House.
  I rise in support of H.R. 4596, the Upper Colorado and San Juan River 
Basins Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Reauthorization Act of 2024. 
This bicameral bill, which passed through the House Natural Resources 
Committee with unanimous bipartisan support, provides a clean, 7-year 
reauthorization of the Upper Colorado and San Juan Recovery Programs 
that protect four threatened and endangered native fish species in the 
Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins by extending conservation 
programs at current funding levels for 7 additional fiscal years.
  These programs provide Endangered Species Act compliance to ensure 
2,500 water projects continue to function and provide legal certainty 
for water users throughout Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.
  These projects, including 1,200 in Colorado alone, include major 
water reservoirs, agricultural water users, ski areas, and power-
generation facilities that use more than 3.7 million acre-feet of water 
per year.
  The Upper Colorado and San Juan Recovery Programs were established in 
1988 to achieve full recovery for four federally listed endangered fish 
species, including the humpback chub, bonytail, Colorado pikeminnow, 
and razorback sucker.
  Those designations led to the threat of significant water- and power-
use restrictions. For over three decades, States, Tribes, local 
communities, environmental groups, energy users, and water users have 
partnered to help recover four threatened and endangered fish species 
while continuing water and power facility development and operations in 
the Upper Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River Basin.
  Without these programs, these 2,500 water and power users would have 
to perform extremely burdensome Section 7 consultations for all 2,500 
individual projects. Because of the success of these programs, the 
humpback chub and the razorback sucker are success stories and have 
been downlisted from endangered to threatened under the Endangered 
Species Act.
  Last Congress, I worked on a short-term extension to reauthorize 
these programs until September 30 of 2024. I

[[Page H5733]]

am proud to report that this bill today is the result of months of hard 
work with local stakeholders, the Bureau of Reclamation, and Senators 
Hickenlooper and Romney to provide a long-term solution by 
reauthorizing these vital programs until 2031.
  My bill has significant support from more than 30 Colorado and 
Western stakeholder organizations, including Denver Water, Pueblo 
Water, both of the Colorado Indian Tribes, Utah Water Users 
Association, and many more.
  I urge the passage of this critical bipartisan and bicameral 
legislation.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Upper Colorado and San Juan River 
Endangered Fish Recovery Programs are essential to the region's future. 
These programs have been successful in conserving and recovering 
endangered species, which is the goal of the Endangered Species Act.
  Mr. Speaker, as an Arkansas Razorback, I rise in strong support of 
this legislation that will continue to help recover the razorback 
sucker.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4596, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

     AMENDING THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005 TO EXPEDITE GEOTHERMAL 
  EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED OR DEVELOPED AREAS

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6474) to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to expedite 
geothermal exploration and development in previously studied or 
developed areas.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 6474

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. NEPA REVIEW.

       Section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 
     15942) is amended--
       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or the Geothermal 
     Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) for the purpose of 
     exploration or development of geothermal resources'' after 
     ``or gas''; and
       (2) in subsection (b)--
       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or gas'' and inserting 
     ``, gas, or geothermal''; and
       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``or gas'' and inserting 
     ``, gas, or geothermal''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 6474, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise today in support of H.R. 6474, which will amend the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 to expedite geothermal exploration and development 
in previously studied or developed areas.
  First, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Steel, for 
all the good work she has done on this issue.
  Duplicative leasing and the permitting process for geothermal 
development result in timelines longer than those of many other energy 
projects. With such a high potential for geothermal access across the 
country, it is imperative we enact pragmatic reform to give all energy 
industries the same opportunity.
  Categorical exclusions, or CEs, expedite the NEPA process for energy 
projects when the area being disturbed has already undergone 
environmental review.
  Section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted five different 
CEs to expedite the development of oil and gas projects.
  It is necessary that these fees also apply to geothermal exploration 
and development because the processes utilized by these two industries 
are very similar, as is the technology and equipment used to drill.
  Establishing categorical exclusions for geothermal energy in areas 
with existing production or areas that have been recently studied is a 
responsible way to increase the utilization of geothermal energy, 
expediting the permitting process without reducing environmental 
standards.
  This bill would expedite the approval process for certain geothermal 
projects by adding geothermal energy development to section 390.
  Again, I applaud my colleague, Mrs. Steel, for this commonsense and 
bipartisan bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise to comment on H.R. 6474, Representative Steel's bill, which 
aims to expedite geothermal exploration and development in previously 
studied or developed areas. I thank my colleague for her attention to 
this important issue.
  I strongly support deploying geothermal energy on Federal lands. We 
have heard from geothermal developers that there can be challenges when 
it comes to permitting new geothermal plants. That is exactly why 
several of the bills we are discussing here today are designed to 
address those very challenges.
  Now, what H.R. 6474 would do is legislate the creation of a new 
categorical exclusion for certain geothermal-related activities. 
Categorical exclusions are used when there is a class of actions that 
Federal agencies have determined do not individually or cumulatively 
have a significant impact on the human environment, and therefore, do 
not require either an environmental assessment or an environmental 
impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.
  Currently, the oil and gas industries have a relatively narrow 
categorical exclusion for minor disturbances in already developed oil 
fields; that is, oil fields that have recently been analyzed under 
NEPA.
  This bill attempts to put geothermal on a level playing field by 
taking that existing categorical exclusion and applying it basically as 
is to geothermal.
  At the legislative hearing on this bill, the Bureau of Land 
Management testified that it is skeptical that this policy will provide 
significant benefits for geothermal because the existing categorical 
exclusion was designed for oil and gas, and there are considerable 
differences between those types of energy and geothermal.
  Fortunately, the Bureau of Land Management already has the authority 
to establish new categorical exclusions administratively without the 
need for legislation.
  Using that authority, the Bureau has recently finalized new 
categorical exclusions for geothermal energy that were adopted from 
other agencies and are better tailored to this unique type of energy.
  The Bureau is currently working on establishing more categorical 
exclusions to ensure that geothermal can be deployed responsibly and 
efficiently on Federal land.
  While I have some concerns about the expansion of existing 
categorical exclusions for oil and gas, I strongly support the Bureau 
of Land Management's work on geothermal, and again, I am grateful for 
my colleague's attention to this important issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Steel), the lead sponsor of this bill.
  Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of H.R. 6474, my 
legislation to expedite geothermal energy growth and development.

[[Page H5734]]

  Embracing geothermal energy will propel more sustainable, clean, and 
reliable energy in California and the entire country.
  With a sizeable geothermal reservoir, more growth opportunities will 
allow California to take full advantage of our natural resources.
  My bill will also support local economies as production grows. More 
geothermal power will create and maintain sustainable local jobs.
  Geothermal can be an important tool to make America more energy 
independent and less dependent on our enemies. My legislation will 
allow my home State of California to seize the reins as the leading 
national energy provider.
  This bill is simple and straightforward. It is just the type of 
commonsense solution my constituents sent me to Congress to find.
  My legislation amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to allow for a 
new categorical exclusion for geothermal under the National 
Environmental Policy Act.
  Specifically, it would create an exemption for geothermal drilling in 
situations where drilling has occurred within the last 5 years.

                              {time}  2015

  This bill will create an expedited approval process for geothermal 
projects and a more promising energy future for the United States.
  I thank my legislative partners, Susie Lee, for working with me in a 
bipartisan manner to support geothermal energy. I also thank Chairman 
Westerman and House leadership for working with us to advance this 
legislation. America needs an all-of-the-above energy approach that 
includes geothermal.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from 
California (Mrs. Steel) for working across the aisle in this 
bipartisan, all-of-the-above energy bill. I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Crane). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6474.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

               LAKE TAHOE RESTORATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 612) to reauthorize the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, and for 
other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                                 S. 612

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Lake Tahoe Restoration 
     Reauthorization Act''.

     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE LAKE TAHOE RESTORATION ACT.

       (a) Cooperative Authorities.--Section 4(f) of the Lake 
     Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106-506) is amended by 
     striking ``4 fiscal years following the date of enactment of 
     the Water Resources Development Act of 2016'' and inserting 
     ``period beginning on the date of enactment of this 
     subsection and ending on the date described in section 
     10(a)''.
       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 10(a) of the 
     Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106-506) is amended by 
     striking ``for a period'' and all that follows through the 
     period at the end and inserting ``, to remain available until 
     September 30, 2034.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-
Cortez) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on S. 612, the bill now under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support S. 612, the Lake Tahoe Restoration 
Reauthorization Act. This is a bicameral and bipartisan effort being 
led on the House side by Representatives Amodei, Kiley, and Duarte. I 
applaud their efforts to advance this legislation to the floor. This is 
a good bill that reauthorizes the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act for 
another decade, ensuring no lapse in funding for a significant program 
serving the iconic Lake Tahoe area.
  During a hearing on this legislation in the Natural Resources 
Committee just last week, Julie Regan, the executive director of the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, ended her testimony with a quote from 
Congressman Kiley discussing the importance of Lake Tahoe to his 
community. Congressman Kiley is quoted as saying:

       We can get past the political divides by implementing 
     projects of common importance at a local level. Tahoe is the 
     perfect example. Spanning two States, multiple overlapping 
     jurisdictions, and red and blue counties. Yet we can all 
     agree on the goal of protecting something that is larger than 
     us. That transcends political differences.

  I could not agree more with Congressman Kiley's sentiment. I have had 
the pleasure of seeing the great work in Lake Tahoe firsthand, and the 
collaboration occurring in the Tahoe basin is truly a model of forest 
management for the rest of the Nation.
  S. 612 will help ensure the continued funding for restoration and 
resilience activities around Lake Tahoe, including critical work 
mitigating wildfire risk and restoring forest health. The bill also 
extends the authorization to enter into contracts and cooperative 
agreements with States and local governments to conduct fuel reduction, 
erosion control, and reforestation activities.
  Again, I want to commend Representatives Amodei, Kiley, and Duarte 
for working with their bipartisan and bicameral colleagues to advance 
this important forest management effort and secure the swift 
consideration of this legislation in the Natural Resources Committee 
and on the House floor.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
                   Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,


                                     House of Representatives,

                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2024.
     Hon. Bruce Westerman,
     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Westerman: I write to you concerning S. 612, 
     the Lake Tahoe Restoration Reauthorization Act. The bill was 
     referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, 
     with additional referrals to the Committee on Transportation 
     and Infrastructure and Committee on Agriculture. 
     Specifically, provisions of S. 612 fall within the Rule X 
     jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and 
     Infrastructure.
       I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this 
     legislation before the House of Representatives in an 
     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on 
     Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on the 
     bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual 
     understanding that doing so will not prejudice the Committee 
     on Transportation and Infrastructure with respect to the 
     appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional 
     claim over the subject matter contained within the bill or 
     similar legislation that falls under the Committee on 
     Transportation and Infrastructure's Rule X jurisdiction. 
     Further, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I 
     appreciate your agreement to support my request to have the 
     Committee represented on the conference committee.
       Finally, I would ask that a copy of this letter and your 
     response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the 
     bill be included in the Committee Report and Congressional

                               Committee on Natural Resources,

                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2024.
     Hon. Sam Graves,
     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Graves: I write regarding S. 612, the ``Lake 
     Tahoe Restoration Reauthorization Act.'' The bill was 
     referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, and 
     additionally to the Committee on Transportation and 
     Infrastructure, and the Committee on Agriculture, and was 
     ordered reported by the Committee on Natural Resources on 
     September 19, 2024.
       I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall 
     within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation 
     and Infrastructure and appreciate your willingness to forgo 
     any further consideration of the bill. I acknowledge that the 
     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not 
     formally consider S. 612 and agree that the inaction of your 
     Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any 
     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained therein.
       I am pleased to support your request to name members of the 
     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to any 
     conference committee to consider such provisions. I will

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I rise in support of S. 612, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act 
introduced by my colleague from Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto.
  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act is a bicameral, bipartisan effort to 
continue the tremendous work being completed in California and Nevada 
for a variety of landscape restoration and resiliency projects.
  The waters of Lake Tahoe are among some of the clearest in the world, 
and the basin is home to wetlands, swamps, deepwater habitat, aspen 
stands, forests, and meadows that support more than 1,300 species of 
plants and animals. Tahoe is a natural phenomenon. The Lake Tahoe 
Restoration Act passed in 2000 in a community effort to preserve and 
protect the landscape and economy of the basin.
  With it came an authorization of $300 million for 10 years and 
eventually $415 million after reauthorization in 2016. Investments made 
by the Federal Government have leveraged $500 million in State, local, 
Tribal, and private matching funds. It also supports an average of 
1,700 jobs a year.
  Now it is time for us to continue that commitment to protecting the 
alpine lake landscape.
  The work being completed throughout the Lake Tahoe basin exemplifies 
the value of both targeted Federal investments and community 
collaboration in forest and landscape management.
  In the 1990s, leaders in the basin came together to form a 
collaborative cross-boundary program known as the Environmental 
Improvement Program. The EIP has become a model for collaborative 
conservation.
  Overall, ecosystem restoration and management in the Lake Tahoe basin 
demonstrate how collaboration, partnerships, and dedicated funding for 
shared goals can yield measurable results.
  In the Federal Lands Subcommittee last week, Ms. Regan, the executive 
director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, said that the Tahoe 
model works because it is able to bring together the Federal and 
private funding and community consent in a mosaic of governance.
  This legislation will continue that important work.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Kiley).
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I have a tremendous honor to represent the 
entire California side of Lake Tahoe, and this legislation, the Lake 
Tahoe Restoration Act, is of the highest importance to my constituents. 
It is also of great importance to the State of California, as well as 
the State of Nevada. More than that, Lake Tahoe is an American 
treasure. Preserving its beauty and accessibility is a great national 
interest, and a national responsibility, with 80 percent of its 
watershed under Federal ownership.
  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act has been crucial in enabling the 
communities of the basin to protect the lake for all Americans and for 
generations to come. Indeed, this bipartisan legislation has become a 
national model for collaboration in the name of conservation.
  Over 50 years ago, California Governor Ronald Reagan and Nevada 
Governor Paul Laxalt signed an interstate compact to cooperatively 
manage the environmental health of Lake Tahoe. This compact was 
ratified by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon, 
establishing a regional planning agency to work with the Federal 
Government on responsibly managing the Tahoe basin.
  Congress continued to support its role in the basin's health by 
passing the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000 and again 16 years later 
in 2016. This generational, bipartisan support for Lake Tahoe has been 
vital to its preservation.
  The Restoration Act needs to be reauthorized to enable continued 
conservation efforts. This legislation does that for another decade.
  Specific programs include forest health and fuels reduction, 
combating invasive species, water infrastructure, and water quality 
improvement.
  As one example, the forest health treatments enabled by the act serve 
as a model of effective forest management, with 21,000 acres treated. 
This work proved crucial in stopping the devastating Caldor fire of 
2021 from becoming an even more catastrophic event, saving the city of 
South Lake Tahoe. Studies have shown that the forest health treatments 
in the area reduced the fire's 150-foot flames to 15 feet, making it 
easier for fire crews to get the blaze under control.
  However, much more work remains to restore the areas burned by the 
Caldor fire and to stop such a disaster from imperiling the basin 
again.
  Beyond just forest health, the restoration efforts enabled by the act 
are working. In 2023, Lake Tahoe achieved

[[Page H5736]]

its highest clarity since the 1980s, thanks to projects that prevented 
more than 500,000 pounds of fine sediment and pollution from flowing 
into the lake, as well as wetlands restoration spanning 342 acres and 
invasive species protection spanning 271 acres. However, in the face of 
extreme weather and other threats, more work is needed to reduce 
stormwater pollution and keep Tahoe blue for the next generation.
  The coalition supporting the act's renewal today spans a tremendous 
diversity of viewpoints. Yet we can all agree on the goal of protecting 
something that is larger than any of us.
  Protecting Tahoe is a responsibility for all of us. At the same time, 
it is an opportunity to forge new partnerships and to form habits of 
cooperation and collaboration as we work to protect a precious resource 
and build a better future together. I look forward to continuing the 
long legacy of bipartisan leadership that has preserved this special 
place.
  I thank my colleagues on both sides, and, in particular, Senator 
Cortez Masto for guiding this legislation through the Senate. I thank 
Chairman Westerman for his tremendous leadership and all his help in 
getting this bill to the floor today, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nevada (Mr. Amodei). He is from the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe.
  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I wish to 
associate myself with the remarks of the chairman of the committee and 
the Representative from New York, (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez) from the 
committee. I am not going to repeat all that, I am just going to add a 
couple of things contextually.
  I know that I am the last speaker standing in the way of getting to a 
Special Order, so I will be brief.
  First of all, to my colleague from the Golden State, it is 
interesting to note historically that when they decided who got to 
represent what sides of Lake Tahoe, Nevada got first pick. I am honored 
to have used that to get the side where we have the least developed 
side there is.
  Tahoe is a success story. This is the third authorization, or the 
second reauthorization of what was done initially. It has been a 
phenomenal bipartisan effort over the years, with the late great Dianne 
Feinstein leading the charge, based on her history in the Tahoe basin, 
and help from people like   John Garamendi on the other side of the 
aisle, as well as many others.
  I will just say this: It is a team effort that is working well. It 
has gone through a development stage over the last 20-plus years, but 
they are clicking along pretty good right now.
  I don't have anything sexy to say like humpback something or other or 
suckers like the fish from a couple years earlier, we have no razorback 
anything in Lake Tahoe, but I urge a ``yes'' vote.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a good, commonsense bill that 
will continue important forest management efforts in an area facing a 
high risk of catastrophic wildfire. This effort would not have been 
possible without the leadership of the Members representing the Lake 
Tahoe basin, including Representative Kiley of California and 
Congressman Amodei of Nevada.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 612, the ``Lake 
Tahoe Restoration Reauthorization Act.''
  I thank my colleagues, Senator Cortez Masto and Congressman Amodei 
for their critical efforts leading the bipartisan bill before us today.
  I am honored to be an original cosponsor of the House companion bill.
  The ``Lake Tahoe Restoration Reauthorization Act'' would reauthorize 
$415 million in federal funding for conservation, climate resiliency, 
and other critical work across the Tahoe Basin through the end of 
fiscal year 2034.
  In addition, this bipartisan bill would renew the cooperative 
authorities for wildfire prevention and response, first used by the 
U.S. Forest Service during the 2021 Caldor Fire.
  As Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Clinton 
Administration, I attended the first annual Tahoe Summit in 1997, 
organized by the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.
  Since then, we have made significant progress to safeguard Lake Tahoe 
for future generations of Californians and all Americans.
  This progress would not have been possible without the tireless 
efforts of Senator Feinstein spanning three decades.
  I urge my colleagues to pass this critical bill to Keep Tahoe Blue, 
paying tribute to Senator Feinstein's legacy by continuing her 
important work.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 612.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

           UNSUSTAINABLE, CRIPPLING FEDERAL DEFICIT AND DEBT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) is recognized for 
one-half of the remaining time until 10 p.m. as the designee of the 
minority leader.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, tonight I join colleagues from both parties in 
focusing attention on what is truly one of the quietest and most 
avoided crises in America today. I speak very directly of our Federal 
budget and, in particular, its unsustainable, crippling Federal deficit 
and debt.
  This silent but accelerating crisis threatens all of us, not only 
these generations, but generations into the future. This crisis is all 
of a fiscal crisis, an economic crisis, a social crisis, and a security 
crisis.
  Mr. Speaker, it is a crisis that we are, frankly, busy denying. We 
are certainly avoiding it and explaining it away, but I think we all 
know instinctively in this country, and some of us know very 
consciously in this country, that it is an imminent crisis.
  Tonight, colleagues of both parties and I, all of us members of our 
Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, which has 87 bipartisan Members of the House 
who are committed to facing and solving this threat, want to discuss 
this issue in a very brief discussion to assure we do not keep sweeping 
this crisis under the rug.
  We will highlight how our Federal finances work, what is going wrong 
and why, what are the severe consequences if we don't correct the 
cause, and what can we do about it.
  I will go into details later, but I first want to invite my 
colleagues to share some of their concerns and perspectives.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), 
a member of the Budget Committee, an accounting and fiscal management 
professional before his time in Congress, a

[[Page H5737]]

member also of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and 
Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and someone who knows his 
way around the budget.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I don't know whether the people back home realize how rare it is for 
a Democrat to be calling upon a Republican to speak about a bill, but 
it is a testament to the size of our fiscal crisis and the fact that we 
have a lot of very good, bipartisan type legislators in this building.
  In any event, our national debt now stands at an astronomical $35 
trillion. It is an unconscionably large debt, which is the result of 
decades of wasteful Washington spending, and it is a problem both 
parties have contributed to.
  To put it in historical perspective, as a share of our economy, the 
last time the debt was this high was at the end of World War II. Last 
year, the Federal Government spent more than $6 trillion and racked up 
a deficit of $1.7 trillion, the third highest annual deficit in our 
country's history.
  One of the most frightening aspects of our out-of-control spending is 
the accelerating interest costs, which, of course, we can't reduce.
  So far in 2024, we have spent $870 billion on interest costs. That is 
more than we spent on Medicare or the military. It is way more than we 
spend on the military.
  To illustrate how profligate the government is, let's take a look at 
how much of each year's spending was borrowed: 2018, 19 cents; 2019, 22 
cents; 2020, 48 cents; 2021, 40 cents; 2022, 22 cents; and 2023, 28 
cents. We expect this trend to continue for at least the next 5 years.
  One cause of the red ink in recent years has been the use and abuse 
of emergency spending. The debt ceiling deal that was passed earlier 
this year set caps on discretionary spending, although there is a 
loophole that allows certain spending to be designated as emergency 
spending, and that is not subject to the cap.
  While there are some items that are genuine emergencies, too often, 
Congress slaps the term ``emergency spending'' on projects it simply 
wants to fund despite the caps.
  Here are a few examples of Federal spending that were labeled as 
emergency spending: $6.6 million for the replacement of irrigation 
systems at two golf courses in Colorado Springs, $12 million for the 
renovation of a minor league ballpark in New York State, and $70 
million for tourism marketing in Puerto Rico.
  These emergency designations add up. Last year, Congress designated 
$162 billion in emergency spending. This year, it is up to $196 
billion. In fact, over the last 30 years, Congress has provided $12 
trillion in emergency spending.
  I have been here for some of these, and I don't consider them 
emergencies. As soon as ``emergency'' is slapped on them, it means the 
money can be spent with reckless abandon.
  Clearly, if we are going to tackle our debt and deficit problem, 
Congress will have to break its addiction to emergency spending, the 
culture of rampant emergency spending abuses encouraged by the CBO's 
baseline budget. By law, the CBO is required to assume that any 
spending Congress designates as emergency spending will continue on 
throughout the entire 10-year budget window and grow with inflation. 
This is obviously reckless.
  Keep in mind, emergency spending is meant for one-time spending, not 
spending that goes on in perpetuity. You would never know that based on 
the way the CBO does these things.
  In fact, the most recent CBO baseline update demonstrates the need 
for this bill. In the June report, CBO raised the projected spending 
over the next 10 years by $945 billion. Nearly all of this projected 
increase is due to $95 billion in supplemental foreign aid spending 
Congress passed earlier this year.
  Does it make sense for CBO to assume this temporary spending will 
continue for all 10 years? It is ridiculous on its face.

  To address this challenge, I am pleased to work with the gentleman 
from Hawaii (Mr. Case) to introduce the Stop the Baseline Bloat Act. 
This bill would amend the relevant law to ensure emergency spending is 
not included in CBO's baseline. Getting our fiscal house in order, we 
must start with a neutral baseline, and this bill will make a 
meaningful step toward fiscal sanity.
  Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I am pleased that this bill will be 
marked up by the House Budget Committee tomorrow morning. I hope this 
commonsense bill receives widespread bipartisan support.
  I thank the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) for his leadership in 
putting this bipartisan Special Order together and for leading the Stop 
the Baseline Bloat Act.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for highlighting not 
only the overall crisis, but certainly many of the process concerns 
that we all have in terms of full transparency and full accountability 
from the perspective of getting our budget under control.
  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan), an entrepreneur and a small business person herself, a 
member of the Committee on Armed Services and Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and somebody that also knows her way around 
a budget.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for 
the opportunity to speak on this Special Order.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues as a very proud member 
of the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum Steering Committee. Together, we are 
very much committed to addressing one of the greatest threats to our 
Nation's long-term stability, and that is that of our unsustainable 
debt trajectory.
  We also understand that we simply can't afford to treat our fiscal 
future like a political football. I represent Pennsylvania's Sixth 
Congressional District, a very purple community, where people 
understand that fiscal responsibility isn't a partisan issue, but it is 
a community value. We know that our prosperity both at home and across 
the country depends on smart and responsible fiscal stewardship.
  Before coming to Congress, I was a business leader in Pennsylvania, 
and I have seen firsthand the risks and consequences of debt when it is 
not carefully managed. Businesses that ignore fiscal discipline may 
eventually falter. They may lose investors, may lose opportunities, or 
may even fail.
  In the same way, if we continue on our current fiscal path as a 
nation, we could also find ourselves on similarly dangerous ground.
  Over the past few years, this Nation and consequently the Federal 
Government has faced very costly and unprecedented challenges, from 
responding to the global pandemic, to defending our allies abroad from 
brutal, illegal attacks, to historic emergency national disasters. 
These crises have demanded investments and American leadership to 
protect our country and to support our global partners.
  However, as interest rates now dip and inflation lowers and eases, 
now is, in fact, the time to refocus our efforts. In the coming months, 
we must have serious conversations about the future of our long-term 
fiscal health. As we look toward this future, the long-term 
implications of our national debt demand our attention and demand 
action.
  Right now, as has been mentioned, the U.S. national debt is over $35 
trillion, larger than our entire economy's GDP. On a similar note, 
according to the Congressional Budget Office, if we fail to change 
course, interest payments on that debt alone are projected to exceed $1 
trillion annually by 2033. That is $1 trillion just to pay the 
interest, money that could otherwise go toward infrastructure, 
families, education, and national security.
  Speaking of national security, I want to be clear: Our economic 
security is absolutely directly tied to our ability to defend ourselves 
and to lead on the global stage. The more that we borrow, the more we 
depend on foreign creditors, and the less flexibility that we have in 
making decisions that are in our national interests.
  As our interest outlays increase, the less funding we have to spend 
on things like our military's preparedness. We cannot afford to have 
our hands tied by debt when it comes to protecting this Nation.
  In Congress, we face critical deadlines in the coming months. As we 
prepare to vote on yet another short-term

[[Page H5738]]

funding extension this week, we are reminded that a bipartisan full-
year compromise for fiscal year 2025 government funding has yet to be 
reached.
  Early next year, we will once again face the debt ceiling. These are 
not abstract deadlines. These are real and pressing moments where we 
have the opportunity to get control of our fiscal future together, but 
that opportunity is slipping away if we continue to delay these 
difficult decisions and if we continue to politicize this issue.
  So that is why the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum exists. We are here. We 
are here to sound the alarm, and also to propose durable solutions, 
solutions like a bipartisan fiscal commission, or the Fiscal 
Responsibility Act that we passed just last year.
  Our mission as a group is to raise the profile of this issue with our 
colleagues and with the public while ensuring that we have healthy, 
constructive debates on fiscal policies here in Congress.
  As a bipartisan group, we know that this is not about scoring 
political points. This is about securing a sustainable future for our 
children and for our grandchildren. We may not agree on every solution 
or on the levers to pull, increasing revenues or decreasing costs, but 
we cannot afford to continue to keep kicking the can down the road.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please come 
together, to set aside partisanship, and to work toward a balanced, 
sustainable budget. We owe that to the American people.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague so much for her very 
realistic and eyes-wide-open assessment of our Federal budget, and 
especially the focus on its impact on our national security from her 
own perspective in that space because I think we sometimes forget that 
this is a security risk, as well as a risk elsewhere.

  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), 
the co-chair of our Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, a small business person 
himself in his prior life, a member of the Financial Services 
Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and a leader in this area.
  I thank the gentleman for joining us.
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. Case), my friend, for yielding time. This is a very important 
discussion to be having, not just among ourselves, but with the Nation 
and with the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I start by thanking the gentleman not only for his 
sincere interest in this issue, but our growing friendship, as well. As 
I tell people back home, so often, you need to have a relationship 
first to then be able to build trust. When you build that trust, that 
is when you can go and find those solutions.
  I am sure the gentleman has some constituents in Hawaii, much like I 
have constituents over in Michigan who sometimes say: Why are you even 
talking to those people? Let's just ignore them.
  Well, sorry, folks. We can't do that. That is not reality. We have to 
deal with our colleagues, and guess what. We have gotten a very special 
group of people who have said: We realize that we are not going to be 
able to solve every problem. We are not even going to try to solve 
every problem, but this is a growing issue and problem for us that we 
need to focus and concentrate on.
  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is using this as an opportunity, the same 
as I will, to discuss some difficult truths about what we are facing 
and what my constituents back in southwest Michigan and the gentleman's 
constituents in Hawaii are all dealing with.
  Frankly, the size of our national debt is just climbing at an 
alarming rate. It now exceeds over $35 trillion with a t.
  Probably like a lot of our colleagues here, I visit schools and I 
talk to kids, and I will oftentimes ask them: How many zeroes in a 
trillion? Usually the first answer is: A lot.
  Yes, that is true. I tell these kids: You know what you need to do at 
some point today? Write down a 1 with 12 zeroes behind it, but then 
don't start at the left. Start at the right and see what $1,000 looks 
like, what $100,000 looks like, what $1 million, $10 million, $100 
million, and $1 billion looks like, and you still see all these zeroes 
that you have to keep counting through.
  Well, that $35 trillion that we have spent here on the big giant 
credit card, Uncle Sam's credit card, is actually projected to reach 
closer to $57 trillion in the next 10 years.
  There are consequences to that. There are consequences to that. We 
can joke around and maybe understand that people aren't aware of what 
is going on. I have sort of had this running joke in our office that we 
need to put a big giant debt clock up here in the House Chamber to just 
remind people.
  We have got to go out there and make sure that people understand that 
what is happening is this debt is crowding out other priorities, so 
much so that, this year, if projections hold true, we are going to see 
interest on the debt to exceed our military spending.

                              {time}  2045

  Just think of that: Interest on the debt for what we have already 
spent is going to exceed what we are going to be spending not just on 
the military but also for every program that touches kids here in this 
country.
  That is more than Medicare. That is more than the military. We have 
to get serious about this.
  I think everybody can understand the concept of having a credit card 
that has gotten a little too high, and they feel like they have had to 
use it because of inflation and the things going on. Think about how 
the interest on your credit card is now outpacing your grocery bill or 
outpacing your auto loan. How can you possibly function as a family? 
You can't.
  We have to understand the debt that we have delivered here is helping 
drive some of that inflation. Interest rates that are there, the money 
that is getting taken away from other programs, is real.
  I am the father of some college-aged kids and a small business owner, 
as you were kind enough to mention. My family is in construction. I am 
a former realtor. I understand and talk to people on a regular basis 
about what this means in their lives, and there is a real factor 
impacting your family, my family, and all of our constituents' 
families, as well.
  In addition to the debt threatening to bankrupt our Nation's promises 
to seniors, to fueling inflation-causing interest payments, the 
national debt also slows economic growth. It drives up interest rates 
and leaves us less prepared for emergencies, whether it is a COVID-like 
emergency, a military-like emergency, or a natural disaster emergency. 
Suddenly, these things could plunge our Nation into even more chaos 
than what it would be normally because we are having these issues.
  For these reasons, and with the help of many of our colleagues who 
are speaking tonight--Mr. Grothman spoke, Mr. Moore is going to be 
speaking, Mr. Case, and so many others--we are really trying to tackle 
this with our Bipartisan Fiscal Forum.
  My co-chair, Scott Peters, has been a great partner in this, and he 
and I together introduced H.R. 5779, the Fiscal Commission Act, 
earlier. That would force our Congress to tackle our national debt by 
voting on a package of policy recommendations designed to get our 
Nation's fiscal house in order, both in the short term and in the long 
term.
  As was quoted by Ms. Houlahan earlier, we are looking at real cuts in 
Social Security. We are looking at real cuts in Medicare. Those should 
not be acceptable. We have to wrestle this dragon to the ground.
  I am proud that our legislation passed the House Budget Committee on 
a bipartisan basis, but we have a lot more work to do. The purpose of 
tonight is continuing to raise that awareness with a national audience, 
not just our colleagues but our constituencies, as well.
  We have to make sure that people understand crystal clear how serious 
this issue is and the real impacts it has, making life less affordable 
and more difficult on our constituencies, not just in the short term 
but certainly in the long run for our kids and our grandkids.
  I know the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, with my colleague's leadership 
and others, stands ready to work with anybody. We will work with 
anybody who is interested in this.
  As has been stated, we may not always agree on the path, but we agree 
on the destination. That is the important part: making sure that we get 
to that destination because that really is

[[Page H5739]]

what we owe our kids and grandkids and future generations of Americans.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's leadership very 
much. Not only do we agree on the destination, but we agree on the 
problem. When you can agree on what the problem is, you can usually get 
to a solution. What we need to do is all agree on that problem on a 
bipartisan basis.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Utah (Mr. Moore), a 
steering committee member of the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, a member of 
the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, another small 
business person, and somebody who also knows his way around a budget.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Hawaii for 
yielding. I really appreciate this opportunity.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise alongside a bipartisan group of colleagues to 
discuss our Nation's greatest threat: the unsustainable deficit and 
spiraling national debt.
  I thank my friend, Congressman Case, for hosting this Special Order 
this evening and for his continued leadership on the Bipartisan Fiscal 
Forum.
  Today, our gross national debt exceeds $35 trillion. Our budget 
deficit is expected to reach $1.9 trillion this year. Spending on 
interest payments just to service our debt will surpass what we spend 
on Medicare and national defense each, individually. This is the grave 
reality of our fiscal situation.
  As we all know, this is not an easy issue, and it is a problem 
created by both parties. Durable and lasting solutions will likewise 
require bipartisan partnership to address these difficult budgetary 
realities.
  I am grateful for groups like the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, where 
Members who recognize the catastrophic threat posed by our fiscal state 
come together to elevate this issue and find commonsense solutions.
  As a father of four boys, this issue is deeply personal to me. I want 
my sons' generation to have the same chance at the American Dream that 
previous generations have had.
  Our national debt matters, and if we don't deal with it, our children 
and their children will bear the burden of higher inflation and 
interest costs, slower economic growth, and the national security risks 
associated with bloated Federal Government.
  Utah, my State, is a model for responsible budgeting with a balanced 
budget every year and a consistent rainy-day fund. This is why, during 
my first term in Congress, I established a Debt and Deficit Task Force 
back home in Utah, comprised of leaders from across the State to create 
a framework of solutions for how elected officials should address our 
Nation's debt crisis with Utah's fiscally responsible values.

  The four main pillars of our framework include growing the economy, 
saving and strengthening vital programs, focusing America's spending, 
and fixing Congress' budget process.
  I know that several of my colleagues involved in the Bipartisan 
Fiscal Forum have recognized many of the same structural issues and are 
working hard to change the tide here in Washington.
  As a member of the Budget Committee, I have been proud of the work we 
have done this Congress to raise the profile of our national debt and 
deficit crisis.
  Earlier this year, the committee passed my Fiscal State of the Nation 
Act, which would require the nonpartisan Comptroller General to provide 
an annual update on the Nation's finances to a joint meeting of 
Congress and help the Nation understand the scope of the problem.
  I applaud Chairman Jodey Arrington for leading the charge on a lot of 
important legislation and conversations that are making the dangers of 
our Federal debt crisis feel more real to the American people.
  The committee also advanced a very important and significant 
bipartisan Fiscal Commission Act, crucial legislation led by 
Congressman Huizenga from Michigan and Congressman Peters from 
California.
  The bill would establish a commission tasked with identifying 
policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and attain 
a sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio over the longer term. The commission 
would operate in an open and transparent manner, and importantly, it 
provides for expedited consideration on the House and Senate floor. 
That is something we haven't always had in these similar types of 
approaches, that there would be expedited consideration to force a 
House and Senate floor vote.
  While establishing a fiscal commission is critical in the short term, 
I know many of my colleagues would agree that we need to reform our 
budget process to help make sustainable budgeting possible.
  To illustrate the scope of the budget process challenges, here are a 
few figures: Congress has not adopted a budget on time since 2003; 
Congress has not passed all appropriations on time since 1996; and the 
only time Congress has passed both the budget resolution and 
appropriations by the deadline was 1977.
  The Budget Committee is working hard on budget process reform, and I 
know members of the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum have ideas to revamp the 
process, as well.
  A bipartisan bill I introduced with Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp 
Perez to tackle this problem is the Comprehensive Congressional Budget 
Act, which would take the next step toward an effective and inclusive 
congressional budgeting process by including all spending and revenue 
in the budget process and requiring contributions from committees with 
direct spending or revenue jurisdiction.
  I emphasize ``all spending'' because, as I listed off things where we 
have fallen short over the last 50 years, it is not even highlighting 
the most important aspect: We don't vote on more than 75 percent of our 
budget. All 435 of us and 100 Senators are responsible in our Article I 
duty for our Federal budget, and we vote on approximately 23 percent of 
that.
  This Comprehensive Congressional Budget Act would force Congress to 
take into consideration the entirety of the budget, and it would give 
the committees the right responsibility. We would have to roll up our 
sleeves and actually have to deal with the entirety of the budget 
because the fact that we just vote on appropriations bills doesn't 
solve a single thing.
  Next year will be an important year as we deal with major fiscal 
cliffs. Beyond the annual appropriations process, we will have to deal 
with the reinstatement of the debt limit in addition to trillions of 
dollars of tax expirations that will affect every American family.
  Groups like the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum are incredibly valuable as we 
take on the challenges and opportunities ahead of us in 2025.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing this important work.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I thank so much my colleague for his 
leadership, as well. I really appreciate his highlighting the 
intergenerational consequences of not solving this issue today.
  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Hawaii has 20 minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate my colleagues spending the 
time here tonight.
  Now, I will go back and add a little bit of detail, so that we can 
fully illustrate what the issue is, how we got here, what the 
consequences are, why we need to do something about it, and how we do 
so.
  The first thing I will start with is something very basic, and that 
is: How do our Federal finances actually work? First and foremost, our 
Federal finances are no different in concept than our family or 
business budgets, fundamentally.
  In our Federal finance situation, our taxes and fees create revenues 
for our government. Our programs create the expenses for our 
government. If the revenues exceed expenses, we call that a surplus. If 
expenses exceed revenues, that is a deficit. We calculate both revenues 
and expenses and surpluses and deficits on an annual fiscal year. When 
we are talking about a deficit or surplus, we are talking about what 
happened in a particular fiscal year.
  How do we address a deficit if we have it? It is easy to understand 
how we deal with a surplus. We spend the money that we got and, 
hopefully, save up a little bit for the next year, just like any 
family, any business.

[[Page H5740]]

  What do we do about deficits? We will borrow that money, and we 
mostly borrow it by issuing government bonds to people around the 
country and world who want to invest in our government bonds, believing 
that the United States is the most secure investment in the entire 
world, but we also borrow intergovernment or, more accurately, 
intragovernment.
  We are busy borrowing, for example, from the Social Security trust 
fund, which is building up a surplus toward a time when it needs it far 
more to pay Social Security benefits, and that money is due and owing 
to the Social Security trust fund.
  It creates extra pressure on the Social Security trust fund that 
money is not being used for Social Security. It is being used for 
everything but Social Security.
  Those borrowings in a family or business setting start to overwhelm 
you. We, of course, like anybody else, pay interest on what we have 
borrowed. Our total borrowings at any one time, which are essentially 
the accumulation of our deficits over time, are our total government 
debt.
  Just like any family or business, it would be nice to have no deficit 
or debt, but that is not most of us. It is fine to run some debt if 
that debt is not chronic, if that debt is not just an excuse to be 
irresponsible and avoid fiscally responsible behavior, and that debt is 
not too high in relationship to our overall budget or economy.
  We measure this many times by reference to our gross domestic 
product, how much our economy is producing. We calculate a debt-to-GDP 
ratio, which, if it is too high, starts to overwhelm the economy just 
like any family or business budget, or if the interest on the debt is 
not too high in relation to our total budget.

                              {time}  2100

  Bottom line, we can afford some debt but not if it starts to get away 
from us. This is, again, no different in concept than a family or 
business budget with one exception, and that is we can go on borrowing 
as long as we want, even irresponsible borrowing, whereas in a family 
and a business budget, that is going to catch up with you sooner or 
later.
  Now, what exactly is going wrong, and why is it going wrong?
  Well, the last year that we had a surplus in our Federal budget was 
2001, 23 years ago. We have run deficits every year since then.
  This illustrates our deficit track since 2001 down on this side, and 
you can see that it increased in the middle part of 2008, 2009, 2010, 
and 2011, during the Great Recession when we had higher expenditures 
for recovery and lower revenues because we were in a recession.
  Then, of course, this big bump right here is COVID when we had to 
borrow a lot of money, when we had to run deficits in order to bail our 
country out of a tremendous problem. These 2 years were deficits.
  Then we recovered in the post-COVID environment, but now we see it 
going up again for no real good reason other than that we are running 
deficits.
  We are now at $1.9 trillion per year, and if we carry that out over 
time, we will see deficits grow to about $2.9 trillion by 2034, not too 
many years away.
  How about our debt?
  This is our total debt, and it starts over on the left side back in 
1990. We had a pretty level debt increase until the early part of the 
2000s.
  The last time we had a surplus, we were managing debt. Then it 
started to take off with that recession. It started to take off more 
with irresponsible budgetary decisions on revenues and expenses.
  The scariest part is the acceleration of this curve right here, which 
takes us only to about 2022. Our debt was $7 trillion in 2004, $18 
trillion in 2014, $23 trillion in 2019, and now, as was already noted, 
it is up to $35 trillion--23 trillion to 35 trillion in 5 years.
  How about the measure of debt to GDP?
  As was discussed earlier, that is a really good indication of what is 
actually happening in our economy. This is our debt to GDP.
  Now, you can see this big bulge right here was the highest debt to 
GDP we have had to date. That was World War II when we had to borrow to 
win a war. We had to do that.
  Of course, the war, aside from being tragic, was not very good for 
the world economy. We had a real issue, as we always do in a war. This 
happens from a budget perspective.
  Here we see a rapid escalation in debt to GDP in the last 5 to 7 
years. This number right here is about 125 percent or 124 percent, 
which is our highest level of debt to GDP since World War II. Unless 
corrected, this is what is going to happen. It will shoot up over the 
next 10 years.
  Reference was made by my colleagues earlier to interest that we pay 
every year on our current national debt. Our annual interest on debt 
now is up to $892 billion, and as was mentioned by reference, that is 
more today than we spend on defense or Medicare.
  This line is interest, this red line right here. This line is defense 
extrapolated at the current levels out to 2034 from today, which is 
right over here. By the way, we all know that we need a very robust 
defense expenditure to handle the geopolitical challenges that we face. 
The green line is Medicare.
  The point here is unless we get interest under control, it will 
essentially surpass defense and continue at an increasing gap. Medicare 
is going up because it is costing more. It is staying up with Medicare, 
and it is essentially overwhelming our ability to pay for defense and 
Medicare, crowding out our national budget.
  Now, what are the consequences of carrying a very high deficit and a 
very high debt load? Why does debt matter, in so many words?
  Well, I am going to go through this pretty fast. Number one, I 
already said it. It crowds out other needed spending, defense and 
nondefense. It reduces fiscal flexibility, especially in crises.
  What if we did have another COVID today or tomorrow? What if we had a 
major expense that we didn't anticipate?
  Our debt and deficits would jack up, just as happened during COVID, 
just as we saw during the Second World War.
  The interest rates would jack up essentially exactly when we need to 
have a fiscally solvent and responsible base to build on. In other 
words, you have to prepare for crises. When you are not in a crisis, 
that is the time to get your thoughts in order, and when you go there, 
that is when you want the flexibility.
  It slows economic growth. It creates inflation pressure. It creates 
interest rate pressure. We have already talked about national security 
risks, especially with adversaries such as the People's Republic of 
China, who invest in our bonds.
  China owns a tremendous amount of our bonds. That gives China 
leverage over us. I don't want to be a borrower from China. It 
disincentivizes responsible budgeting internationally.
  Many countries around the world are facing budgetary pressures. If we 
can't run our own show, how can we ask them to run their own show 
responsibly?
  Finally, it feeds directly into arguments by the PRC and others that 
are seeking to replace our dollar as the world's reserve currency.
  Essentially, what they are saying is the dollar is not a stable, not 
a responsible, not a secure currency, so let's try our own. We are 
begging all of these questions right now.
  What do we do about all of this?
  There are a couple of things we can do. First of all, we can 
acknowledge the issue, and we can acknowledge the crisis, and we can 
acknowledge that we have something that we must work on.
  Number one, stop looking for marginal, illusory, magic solutions. For 
those that say we can grow our way out of this, no, we can't.
  We would have to have an annual growth rate of somewhere around the 
range of 10 percent a year, which is absolutely unrealistic for the 
foreseeable future, for us to solve this simply by growing this 
economy. Any economist would say that we are doing incredibly well to 
come even close to 10 percent a year.
  We can also stop the bleeding and reduce annual deficits through 
mechanisms such as paygo, which is a responsible process that we have 
followed sometimes, and lately not followed, under which whenever we 
reduce revenues through tax reductions, we have to offset them with 
expenses or revenue somewhere else or vice versa. Whenever we increase 
a program cost,

[[Page H5741]]

we have to pay for it or else reduce another program cost so that it is 
budget neutral.
  We obviously need to rebalance revenue and expense over time in our 
tax and spending policies with major decisions coming up.
  Finally, as was mentioned, we probably need some major help with a 
fiscal commission. A fiscal commission can help us to sort through this 
in a nonpartisan, apolitical way to provide the expertise necessary to 
make recommendations that we must take a look at.
  To those that criticize fiscal commissions, I would pose the 
question, well, what is your solution, then? Is there a solution that 
you have that you think would help us to solve this incredible crisis?
  In conclusion, for the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, my 87 colleagues and 
others who believe that this is, indeed, a crisis, we have a couple of 
steps that we have to go through.
  The first step is to stop the denial, which is where we are right 
now, for this to be an issue in our campaigns, in our elections, for 
this to be front and center in our public discourse scores.
  Then we have to ask, what can we do?
  There is plenty we can do.
  First of all, we can get through denial and get firmly into step 
number two, which is to do something about it. Then next, of course, 
acknowledge that the solutions are hard, but the alternative of doing 
nothing is and will be far, far harder.
  We urge acknowledgment and action both within our colleagues in 
Congress and especially with the American people as we consider this 
crisis.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                  FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO JANUARY 6

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) is 
recognized until 10 p.m. as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Georgia?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise this late evening to discuss and inform the 
American people about a very important moment in the history of the 
United States.
  Now, as Members of Congress, we have a very important job to do here. 
We have a lot of responsibility, but one of those responsibilities, Mr. 
Speaker, is to seek the truth, especially in our investigative roles, 
and report the truth.
  We also have a job of correcting the record and calling attention to 
a false narrative that, quite frankly, has been peddled on the American 
people for the last 2 years.
  Now, in January of 2023, Speaker Kevin McCarthy asked me to take on a 
huge task, and that was to chair the first ever Subcommittee of 
Oversight on the Committee on House Administration. The task that he 
asked me to take on was to investigate the events of January 6 as well 
as to investigate the actions of the January 6th Select Committee.
  I agreed to take on this investigation under the condition that I was 
provided the resources, the staff, and the funding that I needed to 
conduct an appropriate investigation and that I was given the freedom 
to pursue the truth without any political bias and thus report that 
evidence and that truth to the American people.
  My mission was simple: Conduct a real investigation, seek out and 
report unaltered evidence--that is important, unaltered evidence--and 
let the facts speak for themselves, and ultimately let the American 
people draw the conclusion based on the evidence on the facts.
  It is our duty to provide full transparency to the American people, 
and that is something that has lacked a lot in our government, 
especially in the past several years, but as we sought the truth of 
what led to January 6, what happened on January 6, what transpired on 
January 6, it wasn't to dispel any fact of what happened. Yes, there 
was violence. Yes, there was violence in this building. There was 
violence that happened around the Capitol, as the videos and other 
evidence shows.
  However, the reports that we have received, especially the select 
committee's report is significantly flawed in their facts.
  From the very beginning my subcommittee faced obstacles that were 
left by the January 6th Select Committee. As the House rules required, 
the select committee was to preserve all records that were used and 
acquired during their investigation, but soon after starting my task in 
this investigation, we realized that there was a significant amount of 
evidence that we did not have. There were documents, videos, certain 
evidence, or transcripts that had either been sent to other agencies 
within the executive branch or in some cases deleted--we had to hire a 
forensics team to recover that information--or there were certain 
videos of transcribed interviews that everyone on the committee admits 
actually existed, but no one seems to know what happened to those.
  Regardless of the obstacles that we faced, we continued on with our 
investigation, which we spent about an entire year obtaining the 
information that was not archived by the select committee. A lot of 
this information, as we found out, did not support the narrative of the 
report that the select committee submitted to Congress.
  My suspicion is that because that information that was deleted or 
hidden or sent off did not support their report is probably why they 
did not retain that information. However, we continued on our 
investigation, looking at certain aspects of what happened, including 
the security failure here in this building, which was one of the 
primary tasks of the January 6th Select Committee, but yet when you 
look at the report, there appears to be nothing about the security 
failure here at the Capitol.
  That was one of our first tasks: What led to the security failure 
here at the Capitol? What about the pipe bombs? Looking at the pipe 
bombs, the tremendous failures that we saw through multiple agencies of 
law enforcement. There was a failure to contain the area where the pipe 
bombs were. The Secret Service had an advance team because Vice 
President-Elect Kamala Harris was going to be at the DCCC. The agent 
advancing it walked by a pipe bomb twice with a bomb dog and never 
alerted on it.

  We also looked into the mysterious gallows that were erected, but we 
also spent a lot of time on the operation and preparedness of the U.S. 
Capitol Police and the mutual aid expected by other agencies here to 
support them.
  What I want to talk about here tonight is one of the mutual aid 
partners that should have been here at the Capitol on January 6, and 
that is the D.C. National Guard.
  There were two significant delays in the National Guard coming to the 
Capitol. The first delay was the request that was made by Chief Sund--
multiple requests on the days leading up to January 6. Chief Steven 
Sund was the Chief of the Capitol Police. He knew from the size of the 
crowds that were expected that he would need additional assistance.
  COVID was happening at that time, so we weren't at full force in the 
Capitol Police because we had several officers who were out because of 
being quarantined due to COVID. Chief Sund anticipated he would need 
extra support, so he requested the National Guard in the days leading 
up to January 6.
  Under the law at that time, the request had to be made by the Capitol 
Police Board. Under the Constitution, the President can't just send the 
National Guard to the Capitol without a request. Otherwise, he could 
send over the military to take over Congress if they didn't like what 
was going on. There had to be a request.
  That official request did not come until late in the afternoon, about 
2:30 in the afternoon, well after the Capitol had been breached. Once 
shots had been

[[Page H5742]]

fired at the Capitol, the final request was approved for the National 
Guard.
  Chief Sund had made several requests during that day, which those had 
all been turned down for one reason or another through leadership. 
However, once shots were fired in the Capitol, even leadership 
determined maybe we do need help here, so an official request was made 
to the D.C. National Guard to be deployed to the Capitol.
  Let me put things in perspective. The outer perimeter on the west 
front of the Capitol was breached by rioters at 12:53. That is 7 
minutes to 1:00. President Trump was still speaking at the Ellipse at 
that time when the outer barriers were breached. It wasn't until 5 
hours later that the National Guard arrived.
  We do know that there was an initial delay here, but at around 2:30 
in the afternoon, the official request was made to the Pentagon. After 
that request was made at 2:30, it was still almost 4 hours before the 
National Guard arrived.
  Just like our National Guard in our States, the D.C. National Guard, 
one of their predominant roles is civil unrest. In fact, they are known 
as the Guardians of the Capitol, the Capitol Guardians. They had been 
used many times in the past to help quell riots and civil unrest or 
even act as a deterrent.
  The D.C. National Guard, you would think, well, yeah, they have to be 
called in, they have to be mustered in, so maybe that was the delay. 
Maybe once the order was given, it was going to get all the guardsmen 
in and get them ready.

                              {time}  2120

  The Governor of the State of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has used the 
National Guard to help suppress riots. During the BLM riots in 2020, he 
called out our National Guard. The National Guard does fall under the 
authority of the Governor, but here in D.C., because we are not a 
State, that authority falls under the President of the United States.
  However, by law, the President can then delegate that authority to 
the Department of Defense. With that chain of command, we found out in 
our investigation that delegation of authority was done in the days 
leading up to January 6.
  As I will get into in just a little bit, the evidence that we have 
uncovered is that days before January 6, President Trump had already 
delegated the authority to deploy the National Guard and had the 
National Guard ready for deployment.
  In fact, on that day, the National Guard was less than 2 miles away 
from this Capitol, ready with their riot gear, ready to deploy to the 
Capitol--not only during the 4-hour delay, but they were there from 
earlier that morning. Why? Because President Trump had already ordered 
the National Guard to be ready because of the size of the number of 
people who were coming to Washington, D.C. He wanted to make sure that 
everyone was safe and that it was peaceful.
  The D.C. National Guard is the only military organization within the 
Department of Defense over which the President of the United States has 
direct and immediate command authority. As I have said, the President's 
command authority gets delegated to the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Secretary of Defense has further delegated operational control of the 
D.C. National Guard to the Secretary of the Army. So it goes the 
President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Army.
  On January 6, 2021, the D.C. National Guard reported to the Secretary 
of the Army, Ryan McCarthy. On January 5, Secretary McCarthy took it 
upon himself to place an unprecedented restriction on the D.C. National 
Guard to prevent any movement to the Capitol without his explicit 
permission.
  What that memo said is basically: If the President himself calls you, 
General Walker, the Commander of the D.C. National Guard, you can't 
move without my authority, the Secretary of the Army. If the Secretary 
of Defense tells you to deploy, you can't go without my authority.
  This tied the hands of the National Guard and placed sole tactical 
operational command of their movements in the hands of Secretary of the 
Army Ryan McCarthy.
  As I said earlier, the breach of the outer perimeter happened at 
12:53, 7 minutes till 1. As we are seeing the Capitol being overrun at 
1 o'clock in the afternoon, the National Guard is less than 2 miles 
from here, with riot gear, ready to deploy, and buses ready to go.
  The President had already ordered days in advance the National Guard 
to be readied, but senior Pentagon leaders ignored President Trump's 
directive to, as President Trump said in sworn testimony by Pentagon 
leaders, ``make sure it is a safe event.'' Instead, they focused on 
optics as the Capitol was being breached.
  In fact, the Director of the Army Staff, Lieutenant General Walter 
Piatt, later would say, ``Was optics a concern for us as we prepared to 
use soldiers downtown in Washington, D.C.? Absolutely.''
  As optics concerns were being discussed, and Secretary McCarthy 
claimed that he was ``developing a plan'' during this delay--after this 
order was given, he is developing a plan--the D.C. National Guard was 
ready to move less than 2 miles from here during that crucial time.
  To put things in perspective, at 2:30, the request was made by the 
Capitol Police Board. At 3 o'clock, the Secretary of Defense told the 
Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, to deploy the National Guard. 
That was just a few minutes after 3 p.m.
  Because it was almost 6 p.m. before the National Guard arrived here 
at the Capitol, Secretary McCarthy stated that he was working on a 
concept of operations, that he had developed a CONOPS, but he never 
communicated with the Capitol police or D.C. National Guard during that 
time period that he was developing this concept of operations.
  What is more, the National Guard already had a plan. This isn't the 
first time that they have done this, or as they say in Texas, this 
wasn't their first rodeo. Many times in the past, they had been 
deployed to the Capitol, the National Mall area, and around the 
Nation's Capital to help keep the peace. In fact, the Metropolitan 
Police Department was already using some National Guard forces for 
traffic control that day.
  Secretary McCarthy, as you can see in this poster, was well aware of 
the National Guard as he had observed training operations. He was well 
aware of their concept of operations, that they knew what they were 
doing, that they had trained for events like this.
  Basically, when you are being used to supplement law enforcement, the 
operations plan is get yourself to the Capitol, report to the Capitol 
Police, get sworn in, and then do whatever the chief of police tells 
you to do. It is that simple, the concept of operations.
  What concerns me is even though the National Guard trained for civil 
disturbance missions over and over again, which McCarthy was aware of, 
the question is: Did he use the CONOPS as a delay tactic because he 
knew what they were capable of doing?
  In fact, over 2 hours were wasted to allegedly develop a plan, and to 
this day, a plan has never been produced. If they were working on a 
concept of operations plan, where is it? It was never communicated to 
the National Guard even once they were given the orders to deploy.
  As we started looking into the reason for the delay, we found out 
that the Department of Defense inspector general was also looking into 
this delay. In fact, they had already produced a report, and their 
report laid the blame of the delay on the D.C. National Guard.
  We had some whistleblowers who actually were senior officers in the 
D.C. National Guard who started coming to my committee and telling us: 
The IG report is wrong. It is flawed. That is not what happened. We 
were ready to go. We were purposefully delayed.

  We started digging into this, and we kept digging and digging until 
we were able to obtain all the evidence that the DOD IG used in their 
report.
  I can tell you here, Mr. Speaker, I still don't know how they came up 
with their report saying that the National Guard was the purpose of the 
delay when it was clearly that senior officials in the Department of 
Defense purposefully delayed the National Guard from coming to the 
Capitol that day. We will dig a little further into that evidence here 
in a few moments.
  Two hours were wasted as, literally, there was a death outside the 
west

[[Page H5743]]

front of the Capitol during the time that the National Guard could have 
been here had they been deployed.
  When that 2-hour delay started at 3:04, Secretary of Defense Miller 
provided verbal approval to Secretary McCarthy for immediate deployment 
to the Capitol. At 3:04, he told the Secretary of the Army to deploy to 
the Capitol. Numerous eyewitnesses confirmed that Miller gave this 
order, including Secretary McCarthy himself. He testified: Yes, I got 
that order.
  After Miller gave this order and while the D.C. National Guard sat 
ready to respond, Secretary McCarthy occupied himself by allegedly 
coming up with a CONOPS plan, as we discussed, and drafting talking 
points for a national press conference with the D.C. Mayor.
  At that time, no one was communicating with the D.C. National Guard, 
which was sitting less than 2 miles from here ready to deploy. No one 
was communicating while they were watching on television what was 
happening at the Capitol and were eager to get over here to help. 
During that time of making talking points for a press conference and 
supposedly developing an operations plan, Members were being evacuated 
from this very Chamber as people were pounding on the back door and 
breaking glass trying to get in.
  While rioters breached the Capitol, McCarthy never once called the 
Commander of the D.C. National Guard, who is Major General Walker. He 
said that Major General Walker testified that he never received any 
communication during that time period or any communication at all from 
Secretary McCarthy, who did not relay Secretary of Defense Miller's 
order for immediate deployment of the National Guard to the Capitol.

                              {time}  2130

  General Walker ultimately received the order to deploy at 5:08 p.m.
  Now, remember, the Secretary of Defense tells the Secretary of the 
Army at 3:04 to immediately deploy the National Guard. The National 
Guard doesn't receive the order until 5:08 p.m., well after law 
enforcement from neighboring States and jurisdictions had already came 
and helped quell the riots.
  This is unacceptable in my opinion.
  Now, Secretary McCarthy was asked specifically about his actions 
following Secretary Miller's 3 or 4 p.m. order by the select committee 
and multiple Senate committees investigating this, as well as the 
Department of Defense IG.
  When asked by the DOD IG in March of 2021, Secretary McCarthy stated 
that one of his staff conveyed the order to deploy the D.C. National 
Guard within minutes of Miller's verbal order. So Secretary McCarthy is 
saying, yes, within minutes of getting the order, I conveyed that 
information to the D.C. National Guard.
  However, the DOD IG report alleged that McCarthy personally conveyed 
this order to deploy within minutes without explanation or providing 
evidence to support his assertion.
  Major General Walker, the commander of the D.C. National Guard, has 
consistently refuted that order that was relayed supposedly at 3:04 
p.m. He never received any communication from the Secretary of the 
Army.
  Almost a year later, in testimony to the select committee, McCarthy 
testifies that he completed his CONOPS around 4:35 p.m. and called 
Secretary of Defense Miller and received his approval. However, that 
CONOPS has never emerged. It wasn't in any of the Department of Defense 
IG's report or their evidence, Select Committee on January 6th 
evidence, and we have found no evidence of that CONOPS plan.
  In his testimony to the select committee when asked about the 4:35 
p.m. call, McCarthy finally admitted that he never spoke directly to 
Major General Walker at 4:35, even though it had been testified that he 
had. Instead, Secretary McCarthy changed his story and told the select 
committee that a member of his staff who had the authority to speak as 
Secretary of the Army was communicating with the D.C. National Guard on 
his behalf on January 6.
  Now, this revision to his previous version of the events is 
significant. The individual McCarthy claimed made this call on his 
behalf testified to the DOD IG that it was Secretary McCarthy who 
conveyed the order at 4:35 p.m.
  Now, let me pause here.
  The conflicting testimony raises serious doubts about the actions of 
the numerous senior DOD officials failing to follow direct orders 
resulting in the delayed deployment of the D.C. National Guard.
  The only reason that Congress is now aware of these significant 
conflicting versions of events is because of the courageous D.C. 
National Guardsmen who testified in front of my subcommittee and 
because my subcommittee has forced the DOD IG to produce the witness 
interviews revealing these conflicting versions of events, which I now 
share publicly. These have been made public. They can be seen by 
anyone, all the testimony that was used by the DOD IG.
  As Secretary McCarthy's story changed, it started actually to align 
more with Major General Walker's testimony. Again, he was the commander 
of the D.C. National Guard. At a March 2021 Senate hearing, General 
Walker testified that the DOD IG--actually, the DOD IG report alleged 
that in this congressional testimony General Walker mischaracterized, 
and his testimony was untrue without any evidence to support an 
allegation that General Walker committed perjury. Basically, General 
Walker's testimony didn't align with the DOD IG's report, so they 
claimed that his testimony was perjurious to the Senate.
  Now, to make matters worse, while the violence and chaos continued to 
unfold at the Capitol, Pentagon officials deceivingly told 
congressional Democrat leadership on a phone call that the D.C. 
National Guard was on the way.
  So during this entire 2\1/2\-hour delay of getting the D.C. National 
Guard going, no one had communicated with General Walker at all. He is 
sitting less than 2 miles from here with the D.C. National Guard with 
riot gear ready to come and help quell the riots here. No one is 
communicating during this entire time.
  Secretary McCarthy told Democrat leadership that the National Guard 
was on the way. HBO footage that was obtained by my subcommittee shows 
that at 3:18 p.m. Secretary McCarthy told Speaker Pelosi that he never 
blocked the deployment of the National Guard; instead, he first needed 
to get approval from Secretary Miller. That was at 3:18 p.m. Secretary 
Miller had already told Secretary McCarthy to deploy at 3:04.
  McCarthy then assured Speaker Pelosi:

       We have the green light. We are moving.

  However, no one had communicated to General Walker to move until 
after 5:00 p.m. The Pentagon mislead congressional leadership into 
thinking help was on the way at 3:18, when they knew for a fact it was 
not.
  Remember, Secretary McCarthy at this time had still not communicated 
Secretary of Defense Miller's 3:04 deployment to the D.C. National 
Guard. A full 2 hours would pass before the deployment order was 
actually communicated to the D.C. National Guard.
  The order was eventually communicated by a different McCarthy aide 
and not by McCarthy himself.
  So on January 5, McCarthy revised the chain of command to deploy the 
D.C. National Guard. He informed General Walker:

       You cannot go unless I specifically authorize you to go.

  Yet, he had not communicated with him at any time on January 6 as 
they were waiting to deploy.
  In these vital hours, General Walker tried to contact Secretary 
McCarthy, but his calls kept going straight to voicemail.
  I want to reemphasize; the D.C. National Guard was ordered to be 
ready to deploy on January 6 on January the 3rd by an order from 
President Trump. That order was confirmed in testimony--if you can put 
up the other poster again--by General Milley himself who testified that 
in a phone call with the Commander in Chief, President Trump, he told 
Secretary Miller that POTUS said, hey, I don't care if you use the 
National Guard or soldiers, Active-Duty soldiers, do whatever you have 
to do, just make sure it is safe.

  This was the testimony by General Milley testifying that, yes, on 
January 3, days before January 6, Trump had already delegated authority 
to deployment. So the reports that we heard that Trump could have just 
sent the

[[Page H5744]]

National Guard or Trump just should have picked up the phone and told 
them to go, he had already done his duty as Commander in Chief.
  Now, I want to talk a little bit about the DOD IG report because, as 
I said earlier, we have investigated the same evidence that the DOD IG 
did, and we came up with a totally different conclusion based on the 
evidence and the facts that we found in the sworn testimony that there 
was a purposeful delay by the Department of Defense to deploy the D.C. 
National Guard.
  The then-Army chief of staff's testimony revealed confusion regarding 
certain entries in the Army's timeline, but an individual within 
Secretary McCarthy's inner circle--this was not included in the DOD 
IG's report. So what has happened is we have got people within the 
Pentagon testifying one thing to Congress and another thing to the DOD 
IG in their sworn testimony.
  A witness who was with McCarthy on that day testified that the D.C. 
National Guard did not get specific instructions from the Army until 
after 5:00 p.m. The DOD IG report acknowledged this inconsistency but 
still maintained in its report that McCarthy himself conveyed the order 
at 3:05.
  The DOD IG reports that the order was given at 3:05 to General Walker 
and General Walker just did not deploy. Even though all of the 
testimony in the sworn affidavits or the sworn depositions and 
transcribed interviews all say that that communication never happened, 
but the DOD IG still reports that it does.

                              {time}  2140

  I do know that one DOD IG investigator claimed to Major General 
Walker that getting to the bottom of why was not in their lane.
  The DOD IG is telling General Walker that it is not in our lane to 
figure out why you weren't communicated to.
  They went on to say that they don't judge operational decisions. The 
IG only looks at whether a law was broken or a policy was violated, but 
those are operational decisions.
  That is fine, except for why does your report say that it was the 
D.C. National Guard that failed to deploy when it was clear through all 
the records that there was a purposeful delay within the DOD?
  As a result of my investigation, it is clear that the Pentagon DOD IG 
deliberately attempted to cover up the actions of certain DOD officials 
that day.
  DOD IG was tasked with evaluating the Department of Defense's 
response on January 6; however, the Department of Defense Office of the 
Secretary of Defense began exerting its influence in order to 
manipulate the report to protect senior DOD officials who failed 
President Trump on that day and failed Congress.
  As we have seen quite often, the coverup is worse than the crime 
itself.
  Although the Department of Defense IG touts its independence and 
ability to produce unbiased reports, the evidence obtained by my 
subcommittee shows that the former IG produced a flawed report with 
many inaccuracies that violate investigative standards. The Department 
of Defense IG failed to interview key personnel, specifically the D.C. 
National Guard personnel with firsthand knowledge, and failed to 
conduct complete interviews focused on facts instead of seeking 
witnesses to affirm the Pentagon's predetermined narrative.
  As part of the coverup, the IG report invented phone calls between 
senior leaders that never occurred where both parties allegedly on the 
call denied that it ever took place. These are people who testified to 
the DOD IG that they never made those calls, but yet the report 
reflects that they did.
  Worst of all, the IG report chose to protect Pentagon leadership at 
the expense of members of the National Guard, our volunteer men and 
women who were ready and waiting less than 2 miles from this Capitol 
with their riot gear ready to come and help Chief Sund.
  The subcommittee has been seeking the truth despite efforts of the 
Department of Defense to obstruct and hide the evidence.
  However, we have been able to bring this to light to the American 
people thanks to the hard work by the committee staff and our 
investigators who were relentless in working to get all of this 
evidence from the Department of Defense.
  As a result of my subcommittee's work, this Congress and the American 
people know the truth now.
  President Trump directed senior Pentagon leadership to keep January 6 
peaceful and safe, including the National Guard, if needed.
  General Milley was no fan of President Trump, that is known, but he 
testified under oath that, yes, President Trump did order the National 
Guard to be readied and ready for deployment on January 6. That is 
clear and unrefuted.
  It was specific individuals at Pentagon who failed to properly 
execute on this directive from the Commander in Chief.
  What is most concerning to me is that these revelations come from the 
Department of Defense's Inspector General's witness interviews. This 
isn't something we are making up. This is within the evidence that the 
Department of Defense acquired themselves that doesn't match up with 
their report.
  However, we have now made these public so the American people can 
draw their own conclusions of what happened.
  The DOD IG report absolved the Pentagon and DOD senior leadership of 
any failures on January 6. It even specifically found that there was 
``no delay.''
  This conclusion is inconsistent with the evidence in the possession 
of the DOD IG; therefore, the report is fundamentally flawed. We are 
asking the DOD IG to reissue their report based on the evidence.
  I give a lot of credit to the whistleblowers of the D.C. National 
Guard. In April of 2024 we were approached by National Guard who came 
forward as whistleblowers risking their own careers. They came forward 
to ensure that the truth was made known. Four of them even testified in 
a public hearing of the truth of what happened on that fateful day.
  After months of negotiation with the DOD Inspector General and the 
Pentagon, our subcommittee was able to obtain and publish never-before-
seen DOD IG transcripts previously withheld by the Biden-Harris 
administration.
  Mr. Speaker, let me just give you some highlights of what we have 
found, and then I will wrap up as the hour is getting late.
  We have senior military officials, civilian and Active Duty, who said 
under oath their mission was to delay the National Guard deployed to 
the Capitol. We have some who said: I wanted to make sure that the 
National Guard never arrived at the Capitol because of the optics.
  Yet, had they been here, lives could have been saved. They wanted to 
do their job. They were less than 2 miles away ready to deploy, but no 
one was communicating that order to them.
  The very leaders who were responsible for the security of the Capitol 
on January 6 used a select committee to cast their well-deserved black 
eye on to someone else, the same thing that happened with the DOD IG. 
Instead of looking at the truth, we need to make sure that we come out 
of this looking good.
  The Capitol guardians have faced a complete leadership turnover, and 
we hope that we can go forward with some legislation to ensure that the 
D.C. National Guard is trained and ready to deploy as they were then, 
but we also need to make sure that when they are needed that they are 
sent and that they are not purposely held back.

  Let me conclude with this thought: the evidence clearly shows, and 
the American people can go out on the website, and they can see all 
these sworn testimonies, they can see quotes by DOD officials concerned 
about the optics of National Guardsmen being at the Capitol while the 
Capitol is being breached violently.
  If, as some believe, that January 6 was an insurrection on this 
institution, then purposely delaying the D.C. National Guard from 
coming to help quell the insurrection was, in fact, participating.
  When you had the ability to send the forces to stop it, and you 
refused to do it because you didn't like the optics, then we need to 
take a serious look at this.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time here this evening. We will 
continue to look into the truth of what happened on that day in an 
unbiased way and report that.

  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                           Government Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, both parties in both Chambers continue 
the work of avoiding a shutdown. House Republican leadership needs to 
get the CR done quickly because we still need time in the Senate to 
move the bill through the floor. House Republicans should work with 
Democrats--House and Senate Democrats--to find the best path to getting 
the bill passed in a bipartisan way. The House Republicans have already 
wasted enough time as it is.
  Once the House acts, the Senate will move quickly to get the CR done. 
I encourage my colleagues on both sides to prioritize speedy passage of 
the CR. If both sides keep working together, if we stay away from 
poison pills and partisan spectacle, then the American people can rest 
assured there won't be a government shutdown. But we still have more 
work to do.
  Of course, nothing was inevitable about the tight deadline we face 
now. The bipartisan CR I negotiated with Speaker Johnson and Leaders 
McConnell and Jeffries is more or less the result people expected from 
the beginning--a short-term CR, one that does not last 6 months, that 
is free of poison pills, and which honors the bipartisan funding levels 
we agreed to earlier this year.
  But this feels like the third or fourth time this Congress that House 
Republicans have had to learn the same elementary lesson: In a narrowly 
divided government, partisan bully tactics and appealing to the extreme 
just does not work, plain and simple.
  I know a few on the hard right say: Oh, we can demand, bang our fists 
on the table, and force everyone to do what we want. That ain't 
happening. What they want to do is so destructive to America that the 
overwhelming number of Democrats and a large number of Republicans 
don't want to do it. But nonetheless this feels like the third or 
fourth time in this Congress that the House Republicans have had to 
learn the same elementary lesson--I say particularly the House hard-
right

[[Page S6340]]

Republicans and the Freedom Caucus. In a narrowly divided government, 
partisan bully tactics and appealing to the extreme simply does not 
work.
  I would have thought that would have been made clear a year ago, when 
Speaker McCarthy kept trying and trying and trying to appease the hard 
right with increasingly severe funding cuts, and it ended up being all 
for naught anyway. We ended up passing a bipartisan CR, and radicals 
turned on Speaker McCarthy.
  This time around, it was Donald Trump again telling the hard right to 
shut the government down if we didn't agree to their poison pill 
provisions--never mind that a shutdown would mean costs would go up, 
programs like Head Start would halt, and public safety here and at the 
border would suffer. To Donald Trump, these are all OK because they are 
just apparently the cost of feeding his ego. It is bewilderingly 
cynical to see Donald Trump push for a shutdown, knowing the pain it 
would cause the country. But thankfully we are still on track to avoid 
that kind of mess. Of course, we still have more work to do.
  I earnestly hope today brings good news in the House. We here in the 
Senate are ready to work to get this bill done quickly.

                                Abortion

  Mr. President, now on abortion, last week, a report by ProPublica 
told a heart-wrenching story of Amber Thurman of Georgia, who died 
because abortion bans in her State prevented her from getting 
lifesaving emergency care.
  I know you are familiar with this case, Mr. President. It is the 
first known case of a woman dying because of new abortion laws in the 
wake of the MAGA Supreme Court's disastrous repeal of Roe. Doctors said 
her death was preventable.
  This was a prime example of the government interfering in lifesaving 
medical decisions--exactly what is envisioned, unfortunately, in the 
MAGA Project 2025. Sadly, as we all know, she will not be the last.
  A person's ability to receive lifesaving care, including lifesaving 
reproductive care, should never, never hinge on what State they live 
in. It should be something to which everyone in every State has a 
right.
  Georgia's case is particularly foul because Georgia has one of the 
highest maternal mortality rates in the country, which 
disproportionately affects Black Americans.
  What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans 
continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. 
Amber's doctors didn't perform the medical procedures they knew she 
needed because of Georgia's law. It was the law overruling their good 
medical judgment. She went into septic shock, and her heart stopped. 
All the while, doctors did everything except the medically sound 
treatment she needed.
  In our country right now, doctors are calling lawyers to ask 
permission before they treat a patient. Can you believe that? That is 
so wrong. But that is what our Republican colleagues, in their extreme 
views on women's reproductive health, have asked for.
  Today, the Senate will act on legislation to help prevent tragedies 
like Amber's death from happening again.
  First, Democrats will bring up a resolution led by Senator Murray 
that affirms the Senate's position that every person has the basic 
right to emergency healthcare, including abortion care.
  I implore every single Senator--Democrat, Republican, and 
Independent--to support this resolution. It is a simple idea that 
emergency care should be a right for all and that doctors should never 
been afraid of doing their jobs while making life-and-death decisions. 
How on Earth could anyone have a problem with that?
  Democrats will also bring up legislation by Senator Baldwin to create 
a grant program that will assist with travel-related expenses for those 
seeking an abortion. This fund will help people overcome financial 
barriers like transportation, lodging, and childcare if patients need 
to travel out of State to get the care they need and require.
  Perhaps if Amber had access to this fund and could have left Georgia, 
if she had the Federal resources to move quicker to get care, perhaps 
she would be alive today.
  I thank Senators Murray and Baldwin for leading these two important 
bills.
  If passed, they may help save lives. I am proud to support them and 
urge everyone on both sides of the aisle to do the same.
  When it comes to abortion, Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have 
kept pushing the same argument again and again--that abortion is best 
left to the States--leaving aside the fact that their end goal is a 
total abortion ban.
  The tragedy of Amber Thurman's death shows exactly why leaving 
abortion to the States is such a dangerous idea in itself. It has led 
to a dangerously inconsistent application of justice and rights. Many 
of these State legislatures are dominated, frankly, by radicals who 
don't know or care one iota about reproductive care.
  And abortion is just the start for some of those States. Some of them 
will want to police a woman's travel. They will want to prosecute 
people who help a woman receive care. They will want to jail doctors. 
That is already in the legislative ideas in many of these States. These 
are utterly delusional ideas.
  My Senate Republican colleagues say abortion should be left to the 
States. What do they have to say about States like Georgia, where 
abortion laws got someone killed? Do Republicans think this is a just 
outcome? Do they think this is an acceptable way to legislate on 
people's individual freedoms--some States saying one thing, other 
States saying something different?
  I certainly don't think so; Democrats don't think so; and the 
American people don't think so. Again, all of this is an attempt for 
MAGA Republicans to get a national abortion ban.
  I hope today, Mr. President--I hope today we can see a tiny ray of 
light amidst so much darkness when it comes to reproductive freedoms. I 
hope my colleagues on both sides support the legislation today. To say 
no--to say no--would be a cruel and heartless message to send to the 
American people.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                           National Security

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Pentagon announced the 
deployment of additional U.S. servicemembers to the Middle East. The 
proximate cause, of course, is the threat of war on Israel's northern 
border. But ongoing Iran-backed attacks against U.S. personnel from the 
Red Sea to Iraq and Syria offer plenty of reminders that America's 
enemies lack neither the resources nor motivation to target us.
  Democrats and Republicans alike should recognize that America's 
enduring security interests in the Middle East are not served by 
abandoning the region to Iran, Russia, and China. But what the Biden-
Harris administration is grappling with right now is a problem of its 
own making. It is the combination of a weak and ineffectual response to 
Iran-backed aggression. It is the predictable and forewarned inadequacy 
of a force-planning construct that rules out serious preparation for 
meeting multiple threats at the same time.
  I have spoken repeatedly about the naivete of abandoning a multiple-
war, force-planning construct, underresourcing our military, and 
ignoring the growing and interconnected threats our adversaries pose to 
our interests.
  It is worth remembering how former British Prime Minister Harold 
Macmillan reportedly responded to a question that the greatest 
challenge for a statesman is ``events, dear boy, events.'' Well, 
events have proven particularly challenging for the Biden-Harris 
administration.

  At the risk of repeating myself, losing resolve to meet and defeat 
adversaries when they threaten us only emboldens them. Retreating from 
difficult challenges only invites even bigger ones. And most 
importantly, there

[[Page S6341]]

is no serious accounting of the global threats to America's interests 
and our allies today that concludes they can be dealt with one at a 
time, at our leisure.
  The enemy gets a vote.
  The demand for a U.S. military that can meet simultaneous challenges 
is acute, and we ignore it at the peril of the entire American-led 
international order that underpins our security and our prosperity.
  Today, when President Biden addresses the U.N. General Assembly, we 
will no doubt hear about the grave challenge these interconnected 
threats pose to America and the entire world. But the President's 
concern will carry little weight without explicit commitments to the 
sort of hard power necessary to address them. The President will insist 
that his leadership has ``produced results.'' That is true--just not 
good results. For years, by its neglect of the urgent requirements of 
the national defense, its anemic--anemic--defense budget requests, and 
its ongoing preference for micromanaging allies over confronting 
adversaries, the Biden-Harris administration has compounded the 
challenges that we face.
  What the Commander in Chief is reckoning with this week is the 
product of nearly 4 years of failing to check Iran and to prepare 
adequately for great power competition--4 years of appeasement, 
hesitation, naive and desperate nuclear diplomacy, as well as outright 
retreat.
  It is, indeed, too late to undo this administration's record of net 
cuts to defense investments. Likewise, it is too late to roll back the 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  Here in the Senate, after weeks of partisan show votes, it is now too 
late for the Senate to discharge a fundamental obligation of this 
body--to provide for the common defense--and debate the annual Defense 
authorization and appropriations bills before the election.
  It is not, however, too late to stop treating Israel as an escalatory 
regional force in need of finger-wagging micromanagement and, instead, 
like a sovereign democracy encircled by the forces of the world's most 
active sponsor of terror. It is not too late to stop responding to 
proxy violence with the sort of unwavering force necessary to change 
Iran's calculus--and, for that matter, Russia's and China's as well.
  It is not too late to show our adversaries that, in their race to 
undermine America's global influence and threaten its global interests, 
they will meet determined opposition.

                           U.S. Supreme Court

  Mr. President, now on another matter, about halfway through President 
Biden's term, he leveled some rather weighty accusations at the 
opposition party. He said Republicans ``do not respect the 
Constitution'' and ``do not believe in the rule of law.'' Well, that 
was pretty rich coming from someone who was already exploring the 
possibility of resurrecting one of the most flagrant affronts to the 
Constitution in American history.
  After less than 100 days in office, the President had formed a faux 
academic Commission to revisit a plan to toss out the separation of 
powers and pack the Supreme Court. This idea had been dead and buried 
since the 1930s, when it proved so inconceivable to even the most loyal 
New Deal Democrats that it almost tore President Roosevelt's 
administration apart. And just months after convening, the President's 
own Commission concluded that structural changes would--listen to 
this--risk irreparable damage to an independent judiciary. That was the 
President's Commission.
  The Commissioners warned that ``in recent years, we have seen 
democratic governments `regress' or `backslide' with respect to 
judicial independence. This has come about through electoral majorities 
using their power to restructure previously independent institutions, 
including courts, to favor the political agendas of those 
governments.''
  Now, this didn't entirely chasten Washington Democrats. And even 
though they haven't yet gone forward with a nearly 90-year-old old plan 
to turn the Nation's highest Court into a fief of the Presidency, the 
campaign to undermine judicial independence is alive and well right 
here in the Senate.
  Vice President Harris, for her part, has yet to disavow her own 
openness to taking truly radical steps. In 2019, then-Senator Harris 
said:

       We are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the 
     Supreme Court. We have to take this challenge head on, and 
     everything is on the table to do that.

  ``Everything is on the table''--including, as she confirmed just this 
summer, packing the Court. The Vice President endorsed the President's 
call for ``imposing term limits for Justices' active service.'' It 
would be difficult to draw up a more devastating blow to public 
confidence in the independence of a coequal branch of government than 
subordinating it to the election cycles of another.

  On a laundry list of issues, Vice President Harris's flip-flops have 
left voters wondering where she stands. But this particular one is no 
secret. The Democratic nominee for President of the United States wants 
to reanimate a dangerous, long-rejected attack on traditional 
independence, an idea the American people would do well to send back to 
the ash heap where it belongs.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so

                               Broadband

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as a Senator from a rural State and a 
former chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
Committee, expanding broadband access to rural areas has long been a 
priority of mine. I have done a lot of work on this issue, which is 
precisely why I was so concerned when the infrastructure bill proposed 
$42 billion for rural broadband to be funneled through the Commerce 
Department's National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, or NTIA.
  I was doubtful whether NTIA was capable of administering $42 billion, 
given its previous struggles to administer a fraction of that amount of 
money. And, unfortunately, those concerns have turned out to be well-
founded.
  The Biden-Harris administration's signature broadband initiative and 
Vice President Harris's tenure as broadband czar have been nothing 
short of a disaster. It has been nearly 3 years since the $42 billion 
Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment, or what we call the BEAD 
program, was established at the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration to provide broadband access to unserved 
communities. Three years. And in all that time, the program has not 
connected a single household to the internet.
  Let me say that again. It has been nearly 3 years--and to be precise, 
1,044 days--since the BEAD program was established. And in all of that 
time--over 1,000 days--the program has not connected a single household 
to the internet. A logical question would be: Why? Please, tell us why?
  Well, it is a story--a sad story--of government inefficiency and 
progressivism run amok. Instead of focusing on delivering broadband 
services to unserved areas, the Biden-Harris administration loaded down 
the BEAD program with a liberal wish list of requirements that were 
never envisioned by Congress and have obstructed broadband deployment: 
climate change mandates, prioritizing government-owned networks over 
private investment, biased technology mandates, prioritizing the use of 
union labor, attempts to impose price controls in direct violation of 
the law, DEI hiring priorities.
  What should have been a straightforward application and approval 
process for building networks has become a literal morass. Why, oh why, 
Mr. President, should rural telecoms in South Dakota be talking about 
climate change mandates in building out broadband networks to serve 
underserved people in rural areas of the country?
  As if the list of woke requirements weren't enough, it has been 
matched by massive inefficiency from the administration.
  One State official who recently testified before the Energy and 
Commerce Committee in the House had this to say about the program's 
implementation:


[[Page S6342]]


  

       States face a common issue--navigating the complex BEAD 
     process. NTIA's functional requests are akin to building a 
     plane while flying it without having the necessary 
     instructions to be successful. NTIA has provided either no 
     guidance, guidance given too late, or guidance changing 
     midstream, all with a lack of appreciation for State 
     operations and costs and the needs of our telecommunications 
     providers.

  Another official from another State described BEAD as--and I quote 
again--``the most burdensome Federal program'' she has ever imagined. 
The most burdensome Federal program she has ever imagined. And worse 
yet, ever had to manage.
  Given all this, I suppose it is no surprise that not only has 
broadband not reached even one household through the BEAD program, but 
construction projects haven't even begun. Current expectations for the 
start of construction on various BEAD projects range from sometime next 
year to sometime in 2026--2026. We are already at 1,044 days since this 
program was enacted. Not a single dollar has been allocated out of the 
$42 billion.
  Well, if this is what things look like with Vice President Harris as 
broadband czar, I shudder to think what things would look like if she 
were in charge of the entire Federal Government.
  This isn't the first time I sounded the alarm on the implementation 
of the BEAD program and the burdensome and extra legal requirements the 
Biden administration--the Biden-Harris administration, I should say--
has imposed. I have been joined in this by Commerce Committee Ranking 
Member Senator Cruz, who shares my concerns, as well as other committee 
Republicans who share those concerns as well. I would like to see some 
of my Democratic colleagues taking a closer look at BEAD implementation 
and broadband implementation more generally.

  As the BEAD program makes very clear, you can throw a lot--a lot--$42 
billion a lot--a lot of taxpayer money at a problem and still not get 
results. I would like to see the Commerce Committee conduct a lot more 
oversight of the programs and Agencies under its jurisdiction.
  It has been more than 1,500 days since the last Federal 
Communications Commission oversight hearing at the Commerce Committee--
the committee, the principal committee of jurisdiction over the FCC.
  In fact, we haven't had a single FCC oversight hearing since 
Democrats took control of the Senate back in 2021. And despite the 
ongoing failure of the BEAD program at the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration, we haven't held a single hearing on 
NTIA yet in this Congress. While I understand that highlighting the 
failure of the Biden-Harris administration's signature broadband 
initiative is probably not high on Democrats' priority list, our 
obligation to the American people and our concern for the millions of 
Americans without broadband access should put BEAD oversight at the top 
of the Commerce Committee's agenda.
  Mr. President, the BEAD program's failure certainly highlights the 
fact that Vice President Harris has been no more effective as broadband 
czar as she has been as border czar. It also points to a larger 
problem--larger problems--with progressivism, like big promises, poor 
results, and the prioritization of liberal social fantasies over the 
needs of the American people. I suspect that if ``Broadband Czar'' 
Harris becomes President Harris, the BEAD program will not be the last 
disastrous government program we see on her watch.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Padilla). The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. BRITT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

                               Farm Bill

  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the dire 
state of our American farm economy and our farmers.
  American farmers and producers are the backbone of our Nation's 
agricultural economy and food security. Despite their critical role in 
our lives to feed, clothe, and fuel not only the United States but the 
entire world, our farmers are struggling to survive, and that is an 
understatement.
  The current state of the agricultural economy is bleak and on the 
verge of collapse. We have problems all over the world. We have 
problems in our country. There is nothing more important--nothing more 
important--that we should be addressing than our food supply here in 
this country.
  Costs for farmers are rising. Commodity prices are falling. Our 
farmers cannot break even, much less make a profit. According to the 
USDA, net farm income this year is projected to decline 4.4 percent 
from 2023--decline. That is a disaster.
  This follows a shocking--listen to this--a shocking 19.5-percent 
decline in 2022. Not one business in this country can survive with this 
kind of decline, and our farmers and our farms are no different.
  This means producers' income has plummeted 23 percent in just 2 
years--23 percent. These figures represent over $40 billion in lost 
revenue for America's hard-working producers. This is the largest 2-
year decline ever in our farm income--ever in the history of this 
country.
  Right now, our row croppers, especially, are facing considerable 
financial hardship. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, 
row croppers had a $27.7 billion decline in cash receipts since last 
year.
  In Alabama, my State, our producers are yielding bumper crops of 
cotton, peanuts, corn, and soybeans; and yet they can't profit due to 
rising costs of production. Our catfish producers are in the same boat. 
Rising input costs and falling fish prices are threatening to put them 
out of business.
  A multitude of factors that producers have no control over are 
impacting their bottom lines, and I want to talk about one of them. 
This miraculous, this world-saving Inflation Reduction Act that we 
passed a few years ago was supposed to save our economy--supposed to 
save a lot of workers. Do you know what it has done to our farmers? It 
has almost put us out of business.
  The Inflation Reduction Act started a tax credit for imports and 
exports. Unfortunately, all the tax credits are going to people and 
countries and farmers from overseas, Brazil and China.
  It was supposed to go to our farmers. No, it is not going to do that. 
For some reason, this administration has given all the tax credits to 
the farmers from other countries, and our farmers are struggling.
  The Biden administration has control--has total control--over our 
farm economy, but you haven't heard a peep out of them--not one peep--
about our farmers. And this is a disastrous year coming up.
  And, right now, we are harvesting our crops, and they are bumper 
crops.
  The issues plaguing American producers are directly linked to the 
harmful policies, as I just said, from the Biden-Harris administration. 
This includes the lack of domestic energy production, skyrocketing 
inflation, which comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, and endless--
endless--environmental hurdles.
  Let me say something about conservation and all the things that 
happen in our environment. There is nobody--and I mean nobody--on the 
face of the Earth that takes care and is more conscious of 
environmental problems than our farmers, because they make a living off 
our land. But we are putting so many regulations on them, we are 
closing our farms down and running them overseas. We are going to have 
a national security threat because all of our food is going to come 
from foreign countries.
  Farmers are experiencing rising costs of labor and increase in prices 
for feed, fertilizer, and pesticides. And I am not going to sugarcoat 
it: America's agricultural producers are facing a very tough road 
ahead. It is something nobody--the media, this building, the building 
on the other end, the House of Representatives, nobody is even talking 
about it.
  Folks, if we can't eat, if we don't have food to eat, we are done.

[[Page S6343]]

  Many farmers fear that their farm loans this year will not be 
renewed. They have to have farm loans to put a crop in the ground. They 
fear cash flows drying up and interest rates continuing to rise create 
an uncertain future for farming operations.
  Although Congress only has a few legislative days left to act, we 
must stop adding fuel to the Biden-Harris administrative fire. We have 
to quit adding fuel. We have to help the farmers.
  We need to pass the farm bill that helps our farmers. Democrats are 
in control of that. They have been in control of it for the last 8 
years.
  A farm bill is for 5 years. Four years ago or 5 years ago, the farm 
bill was $870 billion for a 5-year period. It runs in a 5-year period. 
So this past year, we were supposed to be working on the farm bill. I 
am on the Ag Committee. We go by the control of the Democratic Party. 
Our Democratic chairwoman has decided we won't do a farm bill this 
year. We are just throwing farmers underneath the bus.
  They need help. You would think by looking at everything going on 
that my colleagues on the left would rather our food come from other 
countries--take over our farmland, control it, and do something else 
with it.
  Producers need a strong safety net. We have to have a safety net for 
our farmers. Considering no farmers' risks are the same, we cannot take 
a one-size-fits-all approach. Remember, we have a farm bill that covers 
livestock, hogs, row croppers, forest, fish. There are a lot of things 
involved. Farmers across the country have fluctuating levels of risk, 
impacted by land and equipment costs, access to irrigation, and 
variable input requirements. Southern row croppers rely heavily--
heavily--upon title I commodity programs in the farm bill, particularly 
the Price Loss Program and the Agriculture Risk Program. Yet Midwest 
producers heavily utilize crop insurance. Where there may be an overlap 
across regions among these programs, we must fix the entire farm safety 
net, not just parts of it.
  Take the reference prices in commodity programs for example. 
Reference prices are how much the prices are in their commodity sales 
report. Our farmers are operating today on 2012 revenue prices--2012; 
14 years later. The costs of production are 22 to 31 percent higher 
today than they were at that time, a decade ago, making current 
reference prices completely inadequate for our farmers.
  We don't have time to waste. Our farmers are facing an uphill battle 
to remain in business, and we are going to find out pretty quick--the 
American people going to the grocery store are going to find out pretty 
quick what it is to be hungry if we don't wake up and smell the roses.
  Even if a farm bill is passed today, producers wouldn't receive any 
commodity program support from this farm bill until 2026. Game, set, 
match, before 2026 for our farmers in this country. That is help our 
farmers need now to survive, not 2 years later.
  Senate Republicans stand ready to act on the solid bipartisan bill 
that the House Agriculture Committee passed earlier this year. Yet 
Senate Democrats and the Biden administration refuse--they refuse--to 
come to the table to find practical, bipartisan solutions to the many 
problems our farmers are facing today.
  Let's don't worry about our farmers. Let's worry about Ukraine. Let's 
worry about people overseas, the 800 bases we have around the world. 
Let's don't worry about eating. We can do without eating. That is what 
this administration is saying.
  This forces us to look to supplemental appropriations packages to 
help our producers if we are not going to do a farm bill, renew their 
farm loans, and help for next year's crops. If they don't get help this 
year, we are going to have huge problems. They won't be pocketing this 
money, if we come up with some money, to help the farmers get a loan; 
they will just be planting another crop.
  Without immediate action to assist producers, our Nation's 
agriculture industry may never ever make it back from the damage we are 
doing to them today.
  America has lost--listen to this--America has lost 150,000 farms and 
25,000 farmers in our country over the last few years. What? Mr. 
President, 150,000 farms closed up. Why? They can't make a profit.
  You been on a farm for 100 years, you and your family, but you get to 
the point where you say, you know, I am not passing something down to 
our kids who really want to farm, but we are not going to put them in 
harm's way. We are going to sell. We are going to get out of the 
business, and we are going to let somebody else worry about it. Let's 
let the Federal Government worry about it.
  Well, we do such a good job here, we would do a great job raising our 
food.
  We can't afford any more losses to our farmers. Our farmers are 
hurting. They are hurting real bad. But have you heard anybody talk 
about it? No. You are going to hear a lot of people complaining about 
it, and there is going to be an uproar in the next few years when 
prices double and triple what they are today because we are not going 
to have food. It is going to come from Brazil. It is going to come from 
China. It is going to come from Vietnam.
  We are doing severe damage to the farmers across this country, and 
nobody cares.
  I will continue to be the voice of our southern agricultural 
producers in the Senate and ensure that we have a seat at table on this 
farm bill upcoming. But as I just said a while ago, if we do a farm 
bill today, we are going to lose at least half of our farmers in this 
country this year--this year--if they don't get some help.
  I yield the floor.

                            Border Security

  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the crisis that 
we are facing today in America at our southern border.
  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have created the worst illegal immigrant 
crisis in American history. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden removed every 
successful policy that was in place during the Trump administration. 
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden replaced them with policies that released 
millions upon millions of illegal immigrants into our country. The 
crisis, the chaos, the crime--they are all a direct result of the 
terrible policies by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
  Here are the facts: More than 10 million--10 million--illegal 
immigrants have flooded into our country. They have done that in just 
the last 4 years with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in the White House.
  At the same time, deadly drugs like fentanyl are flowing into our 
communities. Each year, tens of thousands of Americans are poisoned by 
fentanyl that comes across our southern border.
  Our communities in every State are being overrun and overwhelmed by 
this flood of illegal immigrants.
  Let's look at the horrible scenes that are developing now in Aurora, 
CO, just to the south of my home State of Wyoming. This is a city where 
members of violent Venezuelan gangs have turned apartment complexes 
into hell holes. That is exactly what they have done. One residence 
said, ``It's been a nightmare.''
  So how did these gangs find themselves in that situation in that 
location, and how did the people living in those communities find 
themselves in this terrorizing situation? Well, according to one 
report, the Harris-Biden administration, along with the city of Denver, 
provided the incentives. What are the incentives? Well, Denver offered 
illegal immigrants 2 months of subsidized rent. The source of the rent 
money came from Democrats March 2021 reckless tax and spending spree--
$1.9 trillion.
  Stop and think about that for just a second. The same law that fueled 
40-year high inflation, that caused prices to go up for families all 
across the country by 20 percent since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came 
into office, that same bill has now incentivized the worst border 
crisis in American history.
  It was Vice President Harris who came and sat in that chair and cast 
the critical, tie-breaking vote right here in the Senate for that 
reckless spending bill. Her one single vote as Vice President, as 
President of this institution, the U.S. Senate, brought record-high 
prices and a recordbreaking border disaster.

[[Page S6344]]

  Look, these problems spill over from the sanctuary cities like those 
in Colorado, and they hit neighboring States like my home State of 
Wyoming.
  In Laramie County, WY, law enforcement officials say that the number 
of illegal immigrants in their jails has more than doubled. One of 
those jailed illegal immigrants is a suspected member of that violent 
Venezuelan gang that took over the apartment complex in Colorado--a 
gang that has been described as ``MS-13 on steroids.''
  Make no mistake, Vice President Harris is complicit in all of this 
border disaster.
  Now--just, I think, today--Vice President Harris says she wants to 
secure the border. New language for her. Well, let me tell you, she 
hasn't done it yet. For the past 4 years, Kamala Harris has been the 
second most powerful person in the world, and she was appointed by the 
President to be the border czar. He said she knew how. He had full 
confidence in her; she knew how to handle the problem. Well, as the 
border czar, she had the power to secure the southern border and has 
that power still today. Not doing it.
  So let me ask again: Why hasn't it been done? Let me tell you why. 
Like Joe Biden, Vice President Harris wants to smooth the flow of 
illegal immigrants. Doesn't want to stop it--oh, no. Doesn't want to 
stop it; wants to smooth the flow. This is an extreme position and out 
of touch with the American people.
  Like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris opposes the border wall. She actually 
called the wall a ``stupid waste of money.'' That is what we hear from 
the Vice President of the United States. That is an extreme position 
compared to what the American people would like to see happen today.
  Kamala Harris also said that building the wall to prevent terrorists 
from entering the country was the ``height of irresponsibility.''
  ``[T]he height of irresponsibility'' to try to keep terrorists out of 
the country. Nope. Come on in, she wants.
  This again--Kamala Harris. San Francisco liberal. Extreme position.
  Remember, terror suspects are exploiting our vulnerability. The 
number of terror suspects that we have caught crossing the border has 
risen by 3,000 percent since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took over the 
Presidency and the Vice Presidency.
  This administration promises amnesty for illegal immigrants. This is 
an invitation. They are inviting millions upon millions of illegal 
immigrants into this country. This is an extreme position compared to 
what the American people want and expect from their elected officials.
  What we are seeing across the country are Kamala Harris, Democrats 
across the board, and sanctuary cities providing free healthcare for 
illegal immigrants--another extreme position of the Democrats in the 
White House.
  They demand that our hard-earned taxpayer dollars pay for free 
housing, free preloaded debit cards, and free cell phones for illegal 
immigrants. The American public hates this. This is their taxpayer 
dollars. Democrats' open border policies have cost the taxpayers 
plenty. The numbers are jaw-dropping--$451 billion so far--and the 
number keeps going up.
  Like President Biden, Kamala Harris wants to stop deporting criminals 
who are here in this country illegally. She wants to stop it. In the 
past, she said illegal immigration should not be a crime. Well, once 
again, she is out of touch with the American people. That is an extreme 
position.
  This is the truth: Kamala Harris's policies are no different than the 
dangerous, disastrous, deadly policies of President Joe Biden's, who 
signed 49 Executive orders in his first 100 days in office.
  This is the problem that our country faces today: Joe Biden and 
Kamala Harris threw open the borders, and 10 million illegal immigrants 
have come on through.
  When this administration stopped building the wall and ended ``Remain 
in Mexico,'' Vice President Harris was right there, cheering on Joe 
Biden. When Joe Biden brought back the failed policy of catch-and-
release, Vice President Harris had his back. When Joe Biden wanted to 
send stimulus checks to illegal immigrants, what happened? Kamala 
Harris came into this Chamber; sat in that chair; and cast the tie-
breaking vote for this radical and reckless policy of sending stimulus 
checks to illegal immigrants--just giving them more and more free stuff 
funded by the American taxpayers.
  To add insult to injury, Kamala Harris has actually said, then: Well, 
the border is secure. Nobody believes that. I don't even think she 
believes it. She should know better. If she does not, that should 
disqualify her from being a candidate for President or for being 
President.
  On September 22, Vice President Harris claimed we have a secure 
border. Who is she listening to? Why didn't she go and look for 
herself? Three days earlier, the illegal immigrant who murdered Laken 
Riley entered our country.
  It is time to close the book on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their 
dangerous border policies. It is time for us to get serious about 
securing the border and making our communities safer.
  Senate Republicans have real solutions. It is to finish the wall; it 
is to end catch-and-release; it is to restore the ``Remain in Mexico'' 
policy--a policy that worked. Our solution also includes deporting 
illegal immigrants and stopping illegal immigrants from voting in our 
elections.
  So I return to the question I asked at the beginning: If Kamala 
Harris wants to secure the border, why hasn't she done so yet?
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.

                          Government Spending

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, here is a number for everyone to think 
about today: $35.3 trillion--$35.3 trillion. That is our Nation's debt 
number. As you can see, we have gotten there because of years of 
deficit spending.
  Right now, this massive sum, which is our national debt, represents 
more than $100,000 of indebtedness for every man, woman, and child in 
this country. While this number is almost impossible to comprehend, it 
poses one of the greatest threats to our Nation's stability, security, 
and survival.
  To put this issue in perspective, our debt-to-GDP ratio is 121 
percent, meaning our Nation's debt is one-fifth larger than our 
Nation's annual economic output. Think about that. The debt is larger 
than our output. By comparison, our debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of 
World War II was 106 percent. That was the record high before we got to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
  As our debt balloons, the annual cost of interest payments on the 
debt continues to rise, and this crowds out vital services that ought 
to be going to people who need them. In fact, through the first 6 
months of fiscal year 2024, our country spent more taxpayer money 
servicing the debt than we spent on our military. We spent $440 billion 
on interest payments on our debt. When faced with this reality, 
Tennesseans and Americans will probably wonder: Well, how did we get on 
this path to fiscal disaster?
  Of course, $35.3 trillion in debt didn't just appear overnight. Each 
year, the Federal deficit--and I have got a chart here that goes back 
to 2005 and shows you what the deficit was every year--which is the 
annual difference between government spending and taxpayer money that 
is collected and coming into the Federal Government, all gets tacked on 
to our national debt, and under the Biden-Harris administration, this 
deficit spending has exploded.
  You can see these numbers. Last fiscal year, the Federal deficit was 
nearly $1.7 trillion. It was up more than 21 percent from $1.4 trillion 
in 2022. If you will recall, the Biden-Harris's Inflation Reduction 
Act--the Green New Deal giveaway that Vice President Harris sat right 
up there and cast the tie-breaking vote for--was supposed to somehow, 
miraculously, reduce the debt.
  Still, so many Tennesseans say: How can you say you are going to 
spend more and that is going to reduce what you spend? It is void of 
common sense.
  In fiscal year 2021, meanwhile, the Federal deficit reached more than 
$2.7 trillion. Now, we know some of that overlapped with the final 
couple of months of the Trump administration, but the spending occurred 
primarily under the Biden administration and under that $1.9 trillion 
American Rescue Plan. It was the driving force of this administration's 
four-decade-high inflation rate.

[[Page S6345]]

  Indeed, if you go back and you look at inflation, it was 1.4 percent 
the day that President Biden and Vice President Harris took office. 
Today, the latest number is 20.3 percent. In fact, excluding the 
emergency COVID spending in 2020, deficit spending under the Biden-
Harris administration is at its highest point in American history--as I 
said, 121 percent of GDP. Previously, after World War II, it was at 106 
percent.
  The only other administration that has come even close to these 
numbers under Biden-Harris is the Obama-Biden administration. Before 
congressional Republicans fought for and secured serious spending cuts, 
that administration ran annual deficits as high as $1.4 trillion 
between fiscal years 2009 and 2012.
  With the deficit soaring again, our country needs another serious 
course correction. Yet, under their 2025 budget proposal, the Biden-
Harris administration has called for--and I want you to get this 
number. Their 2025 budget proposal calls for $86 trillion in spending 
over the next 10 years--$86 trillion. It would increase our national 
debt--that $35.3 trillion number--it would increase it by $18 trillion.
  Now, bear in mind, this is spending they are putting on the books. 
They are claiming it. They are out here shouting for it. Bidenomics, it 
is working. But, again, we look at this and say: How can you spend more 
and then say you are reducing the deficit? It is void of common sense.
  Instead of fiscal recklessness, our country needs fiscal 
responsibility. Every year, I have legislation that would slash Federal 
spending--and I do these bills every year--by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 
percent for discretionary spending, excluding Defense, Homeland 
Security, and Veterans Affairs. I fully believe anybody can find a way 
to save one penny, two pennies, or a nickel out of what they are given 
to spend.
  At a time when growth in government hiring is now outpacing growth in 
private sector hiring, Congress must also address the ballooning size 
of the Federal Government, which now employs nearly 2.4 million 
bureaucrats. It is time to start freezing salaries and freezing Federal 
hiring.
  While there are many more steps that need to be taken to put America 
on a better fiscal trajectory, these moves would begin to tackle the 
threat that is posed to our Nation and to our freedoms because of 
overspending. If we don't get busy with this and find some ways to 
wrestle with this debt and with this out-of-control spending, it is our 
children and grandchildren who will suffer by having to pay that bill.

                          Country Music Month

  Mr. President, each year since 1961, the Country Music Association 
has inducted the legendary performers, songwriters, and artists of this 
uniquely American musical tradition into the Country Music Hall of 
Fame.
  In many ways, this distinction is the highest honor in country music, 
with names like Hank Williams, Chet Atkins, Dolly Parton, and Elvis 
Presley among its roll of honor. Next month, three new names will join 
this legendary group during the Hall of Fame Medallion Ceremony: John 
Anderson, a force for traditionalism in country music, who achieved 20 
Top Ten country singles across a five-decades-long career; James 
Burton, who is considered one of the greatest guitarists in all of 
music, performing and recording with the likes of Elvis, Merle Haggard, 
John Denver, and Emmylou Harris; and the late Toby Keith, an 
exceptional storyteller who brought joy to millions around the world 
through his music, especially to our men and women in uniform.
  While each artist has their own distinct sound and style, they share 
a music tradition that reminds every American of the things that truly 
matter: faith, family, freedom, hope, opportunity, and patriotism.
  To honor this incredible genre, this week I am introducing a 
resolution that would designate October 2024 as Country Music Month.
  There is a reason the Grand Ole Opry--the most famous stage in 
country music--is known as the home of American music. Now is the 
perfect time for Congress to honor the contributions of country music 
and its legendary performers and artists to the story and the history 
of the United States.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                      Nomination of Michael Sfraga

  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this morning 
to speak about the nomination of Dr. Michael Sfraga. He is an Alaskan, 
and he has been nominated to be our Nation's very first Ambassador at 
Large for the Arctic.
  We are going to have this vote very shortly, and my hope is that 
colleagues will see not only the imperative for an Arctic Ambassador at 
this moment in time but also to recognize that this nominee, Dr. 
Sfraga, is absolutely impeccable in terms of his qualifications for 
this position.
  He is one who is known widely throughout Arctic circles as our Arctic 
expert and the expert in everything from research to policy, to 
national security.
  We are the only Arctic Nation that lacks an Arctic Ambassador. I 
think colleagues are at that point in time where they recognize it is 
past time that we have that representation in the room when issues are 
as contentious as they are.
  Let me just share with you a few reminders about what is happening in 
the Far North. We were all made aware, on July 24, when Russian and 
Chinese bombers flew a joint patrol for the first time off the coast of 
Alaska. What was unusual was not the fact that Russia and China were 
flying together, but it was the fact that it was the first time they 
had done it jointly in the Arctic.
  We see the Russians regularly fly into our air defense identification 
zone--or ADIZ--but this was the first time to see the Chinese flying in 
this area with a joint mission. And we have just seen events continue 
to unfold throughout the summer.
  Just a couple of weeks ago, September 10, Russia began a massive, 
weeklong, worldwide ``Ocean-24'' exercise with hundreds of warships, 
more than 100 aircraft, and nearly 100,000 troops. This exercise is the 
largest since the fall of the Soviet Union, but it also had Chinese 
participation.
  Between its start and end, NORAD and the air forces stationed in 
Alaska detected, tracked, and intercepted four different Russian 
incursions into our Alaska ADIZ.
  So we have come to expect incursions throughout the year, usually 
about six or seven. Think about that. In just 5 days, our air defenses 
were tested as much as they tend to be tested in any given year. So we 
are now way ahead on publicly reported intercepts this year, up to 10. 
We have got 3 months left.
  There has also been an unprecedented level of naval activity off the 
coast. We saw the U.S. Coast Guard detect four Russian naval vessels 50 
miles northwest of Point Hope. Just take it back a couple of years when 
Russian warships chased Alaska fishermen out of an area within our EEZ. 
That was back in August of 2020. Those are not isolated incidents 
either.
  Last August, the Coast Guard detected and shadowed a Russian 
intelligence ship operating off of the Aleutians. This July, the Coast 
Guard detected and shadowed a Chinese surface action group within our 
EEZ and the Bering Sea.
  We all remember the Chinese surveillance balloons that transited 
above Alaska and the Arctic last year.
  And then just last night, I received notification from NORTHCOM of 
yet further intercepts of four Russian aircraft.
  I hope that we can all agree that this is an unprecedented time for 
the region. Normally, we think of the Arctic as ``High North, Low 
Tension,'' but right now it is ``High North,'' and it is ``Rising 
Tension.''
  One thing that is missing is a Senate-confirmed diplomat who will 
spend his or her time focused on Arctic issues, working with our 
allies, engaging our adversaries, and sending these very clear messages 
that we will protect America's interest in the Arctic.
  I had a chance to talk to Dr. Sfraga just literally hours ago. We 
were talking about this very intercept and what

[[Page S6346]]

we are seeing. He wanted to issue a statement as to his concern 
regarding what we are seeing with these air incursions into our ADIZ 
and into our EEZ off of Alaska shores.
  He says as follows:

       If confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador at Large for Arctic 
     Affairs, I commit to do everything in my power to 
     relentlessly push back against these malign actors in this 
     new era of authoritarian aggression and press for more 
     military assets and infrastructure in the Arctic region to 
     protect America's economic and security interests.

  So it is clear, we need an Arctic Ambassador. And we need this 
individual, Dr. Mike Sfraga, to be that Arctic Ambassador.
  He was nominated in February of last year. His nomination was 
reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee in March, and today we 
have got an opportunity to confirm him.
  I have mentioned that I think his qualifications are second to none. 
All you need to do is look at this gentleman's background: 30 years 
focused on the Arctic, a career of service in this area.
  He is an accomplished geographer, a researcher, a teacher with a 
Ph.D. from the University of Alaska. He helped establish the University 
of the Arctic. He co-created, co-led the State Department's Fulbright 
Arctic Initiative. He established the Polar Institute at the Wilson 
Center, which has become the Arctic Public Square for high-level 
conversations about the Far North.
  He chairs, currently, the US Arctic Research Commission, which 
advises us in Congress and the President on international research in 
the Arctic.
  When I spoke to him--he is in Helsinki, and he is going be to 
attending the Helsinki Security Conference. Next week, he is going to 
be at the Warsaw Conference.
  This man is in every conversation--every conversation--that surrounds 
the Arctic. He has the respect of those within the military, within the 
academic community, within policy. He is the person who knows the 
Arctic best.
  And his vast experience means that he knows how to handle our 
adversaries like Russia and China--across the interagency process with 
allies and partners--and doing it through a position of strength.
  Some have argued that perhaps his past interactions with regional 
players disqualify him from serving in this role.
  He is an Alaskan. We share a maritime border with Russia. We used to 
have regular nonstop air service to Russia, believe it or not. That is 
part of a time when, obviously, relations were better and Putin hadn't 
decided to invade Ukraine. But it wasn't uncommon for Alaskans to visit 
and work and know people who live there.
  He has also been criticized for attending international forums. 
Remember, he is not the only American or U.S. Government official in 
attendance at these meetings. I can't count the number of times I have 
gone as the U.S. representative to these meetings, and Mike Sfraga is 
there in the room, leading the conversation.

  Another area of criticism is that he failed to disclose fully before 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when his application came 
forward. Keep in mind, he is at every conference on the Arctic 
happening out there.
  I am told--I am told--that attendance on panels or conferences are 
not required for inclusion in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
questionnaire. When the committee came back and said: We know that 
there are other conferences you have attended. You have failed to 
disclose these. He went back, and he fully--fully--amended his 
disclosure to make sure that there were no omissions.
  So he then, when he submitted that to the committee, realized, 
through looking at his airline records, that he had failed to disclose 
yet another conference. So he went back voluntarily to do it. He has 
made sure that everything that has been asked has been provided.
  I tell you, the criticisms that Dr. Sfraga has faced, I think, are a 
great way to ensure that the United States never has an Arctic 
Ambassador or that we ultimately have to confirm an individual who has 
never even been there, who knows very little about it, and won't do 
anything to protect or advance our strategic interests. That would be a 
loss because the Arctic is no longer this isolated, distant region. It 
is the place of strategic importance, economic potential, and growing 
competition.
  And the United States must be prepared to lead. We have to be sitting 
at the table. We have to have that representation that we have lacked--
that we have lacked.
  Personnel is policy, and Dr. Sfraga is ready to take this on. So I 
urge the Senate to see through the challenges, the attacks, I think, on 
Dr. Sfraga.
  There is nothing in his past or in his file that is disqualifying. We 
know exactly what we are getting. He has been a public figure. He has 
shared his views on the Arctic for years, and he continues, to this 
day, to do just that.
  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting yes to confirm Dr. 
Sfraga.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.
  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to speak for up to 4 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise today in opposition 
to the nomination of Michael Sfraga to be Ambassador at Large for 
Arctic Affairs, not because I don't think we need an ambassador--we 
do--and not because I don't think Mr. Sfraga has the knowledge and the 
expertise to do this--I think he does--and not because he is not a nice 
person--I have met him. He is very engaging. I think he is a nice 
person, generally.
  The Arctic is a critically important region under threat from 
increasing Russian and Chinese activity. An Arctic Ambassador should 
help advance U.S. leadership, but this person must demonstrate 
experience and sound judgment, not just in science but also in matters 
of national security. Dr. Sfraga is not qualified in that regard as far 
as I am concerned. In fact, I believe he makes the situation worse.

  Based on his evasiveness during his vetting by the Foreign Relations 
Committee, I believe Dr. Sfraga could pose a counterintelligence and 
foreign malign influence threat to our Nation. I don't say that 
lightly.
  Dr. Sfraga was asked repeatedly to provide his foreign travel, his 
foreign contacts, and his appearances on panels to the vetting 
personnel, and he failed to be open and transparent. He updated his 
file four times--maybe a new record--each time only after being 
confronted with additional information he tried to conceal.
  For instance, while at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Dr. Sfraga 
negotiated no less than 27 MOUs with Chinese academic institutions tied 
to China's intelligence services. Only after confronting him did Dr. 
Sfraga admit that he negotiated these MOUs. One in particular was with 
a Chinese university with ties to Chinese intelligence services, and 
the MOU gave the Chinese access to the university's IT systems, 
exposing it to substantial cyber threats.
  On Russia, Dr. Sfraga failed to disclose a panel he spoke on in 
November 2021. Transneft, a sanctioned Russian state-owned energy firm, 
sponsored this conference.
  He also failed to disclose articles he wrote and events he spoke at 
where he advocated for Arctic engagement with Russia and China, as 
required by the SFRC's questionnaire. There is no one questioning that 
engagement is necessary. I really think that he is naive, at best, as 
far as dealing with Russia and China. And, in his defense, the entire 
academic community, for that matter, shares this naivety when compared 
to our national security Agencies.
  In May 2023, I took the unusual step of formally requesting the FBI 
to conduct a supplementary background check. In the 16 years that I 
have been here as a Senator, I have never asked the FBI for any kind of 
an investigation. I asked that this be supplemented. The FBI's response 
stated it could not conduct this investigation without White House 
permission, which the White House would not grant.
  This means the Senate does not have a complete picture of the 
counterintelligence or other risks to our national security posed by 
Dr. Sfraga. The majority leader should never have scheduled a vote on 
Dr. Sfraga until a full

[[Page S6347]]

vetting was complete and until this body, which is a safeguard for our 
national security, had all the information that it needed. It doesn't.
  Despite the poor due diligence on this nominee, there is still time 
for the Senate to do the right thing. I know it won't. I know this is 
essentially going to be a party-line vote. The Democrats want this 
person; they are going to get him.
  If we truly care about advancing American and U.S. leadership in the 
Arctic and tackling the threats posed by our adversaries, we must do 
better--a lot better--than deliberately putting personnel in place that 
can pose a risk to national security. This appointment is such an 
appointment. This is not some political person going into a place where 
they can't do any harm. This is a person who is going to be at the 
crossroads of national security, dealing with people from China, for 
instance, every one of whom is an agent of the Chinese Communist Party, 
because every Chinese national is an agent of the Communist Party, and 
they have no ability to conduct themselves freely.
  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination of Michael Sfraga 
for Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hickenlooper). The Senator from Colorado.

             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar

  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am rising right now to speak about the 
urgency to quickly confirm two bipartisan members to the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission. Time is really of the essence as the term of two 
voting members, Judge Claria Horn Boom and Judge John Gleeson, will 
expire this Congress.

[[Page S6348]]

  For decades, the Senate has come together and confirmed all 
Commissioners to the Sentencing Commission by a voice vote and, on one 
occasion, two members by unanimous consent after they had been 
considered by the Judiciary Committee. This used to be just something 
easily done. There is no reason to depart from this incredible 
bipartisan precedent. We must confirm these two nominees today.
  Just as a reminder, Congress created the Sentencing Commission in 
1984 as an independent Agency, housed in the judicial branch, to reduce 
sentencing disparities and to promote transparency and proportionality 
in sentencing. By statute, the Commission must have bipartisan 
representation amongst its members. It calls for our coming together. 
This mandate reflects the consensus-driven, evidence-based approach 
Congress has envisioned in making Federal criminal sentencing fairer 
and more balanced for the United States of America.
  The Sentencing Commission plays a critical role in our Federal legal 
system. It establishes sentencing policies and practices for Federal 
courts, and it promulgates and amends the sentencing guidelines, which 
serve as the cornerstone for every Federal judge when deciding a 
criminal sentence. It is deeply imperative that the Commission maintain 
a full slate of voting members to continue this profound work.
  Recent history has shown us what happens when the Commission is 
deprived of its full membership. From 2019 to 2022, the Commission 
lacked a voting quorum and could not update the sentencing guidelines 
in response to new Federal criminal statutes, including the big 
bipartisan work we did to get the First Step Act passed and signed by 
Donald Trump. Without direction on how to implement the new provisions 
and criminal penalties, circuit courts split over the proper 
interpretation of the guidelines, resulting in disparate sentences for 
people who are dependent solely on which circuit court they were tried 
in. In other words, there was no equal justice under the law. There 
wasn't fairness or proportionality.
  So, consistent with this Commission's mandate, these nominees have to 
and will need to continue to function in our bipartisan way--the 
vision. It is up to us to work in this bipartisan way. Therefore, I ask 
now to confirm two bipartisan members of the U.S. Sentencing 
Commission, Judge Claria Horn Boom and Judge Gleeson.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 602 and 603; that the 
Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or 
debate; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of 
the Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Alabama.
  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, 
therefore, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from New Jersey.
  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. That 
word is difficult to say, but it seems like that happened quicker than 
even my saying that word. With something so important as this, I was 
hoping for more of an understanding of why this is being blocked.
  Again, perhaps one of the greatest marks of this institution, in my 
10 years of experience, has been the times we have come together--
multiple times--to make our justice system more just.
  This seems, to me, to be obstructionist to the hopes that we can be a 
nation that ends this partisanship, that ends this unnecessary 
partisanship--excuse me--and that ends the sort of tribalism that is 
making this institution less operative.
  We all come here from various parts of our great Nation to get things 
done, and there seems to be this pattern in the United States of 
America of our finding less comity, less togetherness.
  I love what Martin Luther King said; that we are all caught in an 
inescapable network of mutuality, tied with a garment of destiny, in 
that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
  When it comes to the exercise of justice in our country, it is clear, 
by not having a bipartisan majority sitting on this body, that we 
create injustice, which, ultimately, hurts our democracy and our 
highest ideals.
  We started this day by pledging allegiance to that flag, where we 
said with ``liberty and justice for all.'' It pains me today, with the 
stopping of this unanimous consent, that we are not fulfilling the 
hopes and aspirations of that pledge.
  I yield the floor.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar

  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I come to the floor today, Mr. President, to support 
the nomination of David Kostelancik to be U.S. Ambassador to Albania.
  For over 35 years, Mr. Kostelancik has served as a career member of 
the Foreign Service and a qualified and exemplary candidate to 
represent the United States in an allied capital. He also served in 
Congress as the senior State Department adviser to the Helsinki 
Commission.
  Like so many of our career Foreign Service officers, Mr. Kostelancik 
has dedicated his career to serving the United States at home and 
abroad. He served in Albania before, as well as overseas assignments in 
Turkiye, Russia, and Hungary, where he led our Embassy as Charge 
d'Affaires for nearly 2 years. Most recently, he served as Foreign 
Policy Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
  It is clear that we have a highly qualified candidate to serve as 
Ambassador to Albania. But I also want to talk about why it is so 
critical that we confirm an ambassador to Albania and that we do it 
without delay.
  Albania is a real success story for American foreign policy. Just 30 
years ago, Albania was waking up from more than four decades of 
communist rule.

[[Page S6349]]

Today, Albania is a flourishing democracy, a fully engaged member of 
NATO, and an aspiring member of the European Union.
  It was Albania in 2016 that answered our calls to take in vulnerable 
Iranian dissidents from Camp Ashraf. It was Albania back in 2021 that 
didn't think twice when they answered the call to accommodate Afghan 
refugees and SIV applicants. So what message does it send to Albania--a 
critical partner, a stalwart ally of the United States--that we can't 
confirm an ambassador for over a year?
  Albania is currently the only NATO capital in which we do not have a 
confirmed Ambassador. As the United States confronts challenges around 
the world, we need our allies. We need Albania. That starts with 
ensuring that we have the stewards of our bilateral relationships in 
place. I can tell you, China and Russia have Ambassadors in Albania's 
capital right now. It is up to the U.S. Senate to determine whether we 
cede ground to our adversaries.
  Mr. Kostelancik has the necessary experience. He speaks Albanian. He 
is eminently qualified to fill the post for which he was nominated.
  For these reasons, I urge no further delays in confirming Mr. 
Kostelancik's nomination.
  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following 
nomination and that the Senate vote on the nomination of David 
Kostelancik to be Ambassador of the United States of America to the 
Republic of Albania; that the Senate vote on the nomination without 
intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President 
be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from the Utah.
  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, U.S. diplomats 
serve a singular purpose: to advocate for and protect U.S. interests 
all over the world.
  The Constitution makes abundantly clear that the security of the 
American homeland and commerce with friendly nations are fundamental 
core interests of the United States of America. The promotion of woke 
cultural imperialism is never in the core interest of the United 
States.
  The constant crusade of career diplomats to evangelize woke ideology 
on behalf of the United States often works decidedly against our 
interests and actively undermines the reputation and leverage of our 
Nation.
  Like many Biden-Harris nominees, Mr. Kostelancik has proven unable to 
set aside his personal partisanship while representing U.S. interests 
abroad.
  His past performance as Charge d'Affaires in Hungary should 
disqualify him from being trusted with a diplomatic mantle again. Mr. 
Kostelancik openly meddled in Hungarian politics. He attacked press 
freedom and engaged in blatant social activism, which the Hungarian 
Government viewed as undue interference in Hungary's internal politics.
  Mr. Kostelancik damaged our relationship with a reliable and 
important ally for the sake of partisan ideological advocacy abroad, 
all when he was essentially a placeholder until the Trump 
administration could nominate an ambassador.
  Now the Biden-Harris administration wants to make him the permanent 
man in charge of the U.S. Government's interests in Albania. The Biden-
Harris administration had every opportunity to submit a new nominee for 
this position when Mr. Kostelancik's nomination was returned to the 
President at the end of last year, but rather than submit a nominee 
with a more favorable reputation, a less controversial background, and 
a demonstrated track record of focus on core U.S. interests, President 
Biden is doubling down and promoting Mr. Kostelancik.
  Cultural imperialism continues to dominate, to distract, and destroy 
the reputation and effectiveness of our diplomatic corps. I will not be 
complacent in such efforts, and on that basis, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from New Hampshire.
  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I don't understand what my colleague is 
talking about in terms of woke ideology and cultural imperialism. That 
is not my understanding of how the State Department works.
  The State Department and our Ambassadors are there to carry out 
America's foreign policy no matter who the President is, and that is 
what David Kostelancik did when he was in Hungary.
  So I am perplexed by the arguments that are raised by my colleague 
from Utah. His objections are grounded in baseless rumors that are 
being spread by Victor Orban. They are not grounded in facts.
  Here are the facts: Mr. Kostelancik received overwhelming support, 
bipartisan support, when he was voted out, on two occasions, of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
  In the 35 years--35 years--of Mr. Kostelancik's service to the U.S. 
Government, he had never been accused of any political bias until 
Victor Orban decided that he didn't think he was executing America's 
foreign policy properly.
  Mr. Kostelancik has served the American public faithfully across 
administrations of both parties. He has represented elected leaders' 
positions.
  I have spoken with a number of my Republican colleagues. I wish my 
colleague from Utah were going to stay so I could talk to him about 
this, because he has gotten support from those Republicans precisely 
for the reasons I outlined above.
  It is up to my colleagues whether they will listen to the 
recommendation of former administration officials and their own 
Republican colleagues or take heed of the baseless allegations of a 
foreign leader, who is ostensibly an ``ally,'' who is making false, 
unproven claims of impartiality. I have looked for evidence. There is 
zero evidence to that effect. In fact, I have letters here from a 
former Governor, a Republican Governor, of New York, George Pataki. I 
have letters from the Albanian American Council in support of Mr. 
Kostelancik. What is more, a number of senior Republican officials, 
including the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, who served under the Trump 
administration, have repudiated this claim.
  So I don't know why my Republican colleague today is willing to 
believe a government that has shown more loyalty to Vladimir Putin and 
President Xi than he has to the United States, or is my colleague from 
Utah prepared to trust the repeated commitments made by the nominee--
and senior-level Republicans--that he served in Budapest with the 
utmost professionalism? That is the question. Is he willing to trust 
that, to trust all of the people who have weighed in on behalf of Mr. 
Kostelancik, who, by all accounts in reading his public remarks as 
Charge d'Affaires, defended the Trump administration policy ably while 
in Budapest? That is what Ambassadors do when they are serving 
overseas--they defend the policies of the United States of America and 
whoever the President is and whoever the Secretary of State is.
  Those charged with the conduct of U.S. foreign policy are proud civil 
servants. They believe in our institutions, and they represent the 
American people no matter which party is in office.
  I am disappointed that what we have today is a number of people--a 
number of our colleagues who would rather denounce the United States 
and our foreign policy, who would rather oppose career Ambassadors who 
have been in the job for years, because they support Victor Orban, 
because they are spreading rumors about what people have done that have 
no basis in fact.
  I intend to come back to the floor on a number of occasions--whenever 
I can--to ask for unanimous consent again because what is happening now 
is not in the best interest of the United States. When we refuse to 
confirm Ambassadors, we are hamstringing our foreign policy and we are 
harming U.S. national security. Right now, there are over 30 State 
Department nominees who are waiting for Senate confirmation, and by 
grinding to a halt our State Department nominees, my Republican 
colleagues have allowed partisan brinksmanship to pervade a critical 
aspect of our national security.
  It is one I don't understand because I know we are in agreement that 
the United States is threatened by adversaries like Iran, China, 
Russia, and North Korea--all threats to the United

[[Page S6350]]

States. Yet they are willing to allow President Xi's diplomats to get 
placed in countries all around the world, and they are not willing to 
let our own diplomats get placed.
  So I hope they will reconsider because what they are doing at its 
core is putting at risk America's national security.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2229

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a unanimous 
consent request, but out of courtesy to somebody who may object--since 
there is nobody here to object--I won't make the motion, but I would 
like to give my remarks at this point.
  Today, I am going to discuss a decades-long priority of mine, and 
that is reforming the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Around here, it 
is known by the acronym FARA. This legislation is necessary to give it 
the teeth that it needs to be effective.
  Just a little bit of history about FARA: Until maybe 6, 7 years ago--
now it is being enforced a little more often by the Department of 
Justice, but prior to that, a law that had been on the books for 
decades was not really being enforced. So that means people could be 
hired to lobby for a foreign country before the Congress of the United 
States and we didn't even know who they were.
  Well, the FARA act, passed decades ago, was supposed to make that 
public because we ought to know who is working for foreign countries as 
they try to influence policy in this country. And now more attention is 
being paid to it. It is being enforced.
  But I come to the floor today, as I am going to explain to you, 
because we had recent court decisions that have made it even weaker 
than it should be--is intended to be.
  Since 2015--to give you a little history of my involvement with this 
issue--over four Congresses, I have investigated potential FARA 
violations to ensure the Justice Department equally enforces FARA 
without regard to power, party, and privilege. In 2017, as chairman of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, I held a FARA oversight hearing, which 
contributed to the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act that year. I also 
introduced the bipartisan Foreign Agents Disclosure and Registration 
Enhancement Act in 2019, which was supported on both sides by the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. The 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also signed off on 
that legislation. So then Senator Cornyn and I requested unanimous 
consent to pass that bill at that time; however, the then-ranking 
member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez, objected.
  The Foreign Agents Disclosure and Registration Enhancement Act is one 
of several FARA bills that I have sought to advance.
  Today, I am here to talk about the bipartisan bill entitled 
``Retroactive Foreign Agents Registration Act.'' The purpose of that 
legislation is to overcome the court decisions that I have already 
spoken about. Chairman Peters, my Democratic co-lead, and Senators 
Warren, Rubio, and Young are cosponsors of the bill that goes by the 
number S. 2229. The bill overturns a recent court ruling that held a 
person doesn't have to register as a foreign agent if their 
relationship with a foreign principal has stopped.
  It is understood that FARA imposes a continuing obligation for 
persons to register as foreign agents; otherwise, once a lobbyist for a 
foreign country is caught not reporting, it is pretty simple for them 
if they don't want to be prosecuted or registered; they just have to 
sever their representation with that country, and they are off the 
hook. And, of course, that is not what Congress intended.
  My bill, the Retroactive Foreign Agents Registration Act, fixes that 
problem, overrides the court decisions.
  Remember, FARA doesn't prohibit any activity. You are free to do 
anything you want to. It is a disclosure statute. It simply requires 
lobbyists and public relations groups on K Street representing foreign 
interests, which might be friendly to the United States or unfriendly 
to the United States, in the Halls of Congress--all they have to do is 
disclose, just disclose. They can do anything they want to, but they 
have to disclose whom they are working for.
  If a lobbyist doesn't want everyone to know that they are working for 
the communist Chinese Government, then I guess that person shouldn't be 
working for the communist Chinese Government.
  Now, it is pretty simple what the spirit of this FARA legislation is 
all about. It is all about transparency. And with transparency, you are 
more apt to get accountability. And who shouldn't want transparency 
because the public's business ought to be public, and you ought to be 
accountable for what you are doing.
  My retroactive FARA fix is supported by almost a decade of oversight, 
hearings, legislative vetting, and discussions with the Department of 
Justice. Congress must send a crystal-clear message to foreign actors 
that they can't hide in the shadows.
  So now that we have other people on the floor who might want to speak 
on this, at this point I want to make this request.
  Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 2229 and the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act was enacted in 1938 and requires individuals 
working on behalf of foreign governments to disclose their 
relationships and activities. Violations of the law are subject to 
criminal and civil penalties. Generally, a person who willfully 
violates these regulations may face up to 5 years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine.
  Now, many thought leaders have written about the overcriminalization 
of regulations, the fact that we add criminal penalties to people with 
paper violations. Ed Meese has written about this extensively. Justice 
Neil Gorsuch has written a new book, ``Over Ruled,'' talking about so 
many regulation crimes, paperwork crimes, having criminal penalties.
  A 2016 inspector general audit reported that, historically, the 
Department of Justice's practice has been to pursue voluntary 
compliance rather than the prosecution of agents who failed to register 
under the act. More recently, though, the Department of Justice has 
signaled that it is shifting from treating these violations as an 
administrative obligation to one that is increasingly an enforcement 
priority.
  In 2022, DOJ reported that it had charged a record number of criminal 
cases for this regulatory breach. In other words, what was once 
considered a mistake that could be rectified simply by encouraging 
voluntary compliance is now a weapon that can be used to silence 
dissent by threatening individuals with prison time.
  Just 2 weeks ago, four members of the African People's Socialist 
Party, two of whom are 82 and 78 years old, were convicted of 
conspiracy to violate a law similar to FARA by acting as agents of 
Russia. The Department of Justice press release states that the 
defendants ``face a maximum penalty of five years in prison.''
  And what had they done to potentially lose their liberty? The 
specific acts they were accused of included attending an international 
conference in Russia, publishing a Petition to the United Nations on 
the Crime of Genocide Against the African People in the United States 
of America, accepting financial support for a speaking tour to discuss 
reparations, and speaking in support of the Russian Government.
  The African People's Socialist Party was founded in 1972. For 
decades, the party has criticized the United States and maintained the 
government owes trillions of dollars in reparations for the crime of 
genocide against Black Americans.

[[Page S6351]]

  While I don't agree with any of their policy statements or any of the 
things they are for, I really don't wish to put them in prison.
  Highlighting the disturbing nature of DOJ's prosecution of this 
minuscule fringe group, Patrick Eddington, of the Cato Institute, 
writes that the party ``and its related political movement can only be 
described as fringe, bit players on the American political scene whose 
previous statements and stances already mirrored the Kremlin's line'' 
for decades.
  Eddington continues: ``It makes one wonder why the FBI targeted such 
marginal groups with little to no impact on the broader political 
process, and whether an unstated goal of'' these DOJ raids and 
imprisoning people ``was to put the entire domestic political advocacy 
community on notice that a domestic group with foreign connections is 
considered fair game for FBI scrutiny even if legitimate First 
Amendment activity is involved.''
  According to an article in The Nation magazine, ``Since its initial 
enactment into law, the DOJ has invoked FARA,'' the statute at hand, 
``to stigmatize and criminalize political advocacy that is contrary to 
the interests of the US government. Early illustrative examples include 
the 1951 indictment of W.E.B. Du Bois, who was prosecuted as an agent 
of the Soviet Union for having promoted and circulated the Stockholm 
Appeal, calling for a ban on nuclear weapons.''
  You can see how this gathers up political speech. You don't have to 
agree with the speech. But if the speech happens to represent the 
viewpoint of another country, the speech may be stifled and you may be 
arrested for it.
  I understand the Senate will be asked to pass unanimously two bills 
today that would allow the DOJ to retroactively require this 
registration or this paperwork and another that would, effectively, 
write an enemies list into law.
  Both give the DOJ prosecutors greater ability to selectively threaten 
disfavored groups by prosecuting activities that are otherwise 
protected by the First Amendment. Yet these bills have not been marked 
up by the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. At the very least, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
of which I am a member, should consider these bills before being rushed 
into passage.
  Therefore, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Iowa.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to speak to this.
  This legislation was passed in 1938. You heard me say in my opening 
remarks that for a long period of time--until about, I think, less than 
8 years ago, when we started bringing attention to this legislation not 
being enforced by the Department of Justice--probably only about a 
dozen people or less were convicted under this legislation.
  I heard what my colleague from Kentucky said about this legislation. 
I think you could read his remarks to indicate that a violation of 
freedom of speech is--we might as well repeal the lobbying act or 
lobbying registration act--whatever the law is--of 1946 that lobbyists 
have to register if they are going to lobby the Congress of the United 
States.
  It doesn't have anything to do with freedom of speech. What it has to 
do with is transparency, so we know who is spending money to influence 
the laws in this country. That has nothing to do with freedom of 
speech. You can say anything you want to. It is just about transparency 
and accountability that comes with transparency. I think it is very 
important.
  I don't find a lot of fault with what Senator Rand has said about 
regulatory criminalization and too much federalization, but this is a 
law that has been on the books since 1938 and, really, hasn't been 
enforced until very recently here. I think when you enforce the law, 
you get respect for the law. And there ought to be respect for a simple 
little law that says nothing more than: We just want to know who you 
are; who you are working for; and, particularly, if it is a foreign 
country, we ought to have a record of who is being hired to influence 
public policy in the United States as a result of your work. It could 
be a national security concern. It could be a business concern. It 
doesn't matter what that concern is. You can do anything you want to 
lobby Congress, but we ought to know who you are.
  I have great respect for Senator Paul. Of course, as you just found 
out, I happen to disagree with him on his decision not to let this bill 
move forward.
  I know a thing or two about government abuse and weaponization. My 
investigative staff has been surveilled by the Justice Department, as 
an example. You find out that from whistleblowers. You don't find out 
that because there is transparency of what they are doing.
  I and my investigative staff have been subject to briefings from the 
Justice Department that were targeted to interfere in my investigative 
work. I have seen government weaponization firsthand.
  That data point shouldn't be a basis to object to this bill. The due 
diligence has been done--the oversight, the hearing, the negotiations. 
This bill is bicameral. This bill is bipartisan. There is no legitimate 
basis for this bill to not be law.
  I thank my colleagues, including the objector, for their giving 
attention to it even if we couldn't agree on it.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington

                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 828

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer a simple 
resolution, one that reaffirms the basic principle that when you go to 
the ER, the emergency room, they should be allowed to treat you. When 
your life is in danger, doctors should be able to do their job. When 
you need emergency care, including an abortion, no politician should 
stop you from getting it.
  This seems incredibly simple to me. It should not be controversial, 
especially if everyone who talks about protecting the life of the 
mother seriously means it. After all, that is what emergency care is 
for: saving the life of the mother. And yet, when the Biden-Harris 
administration tried to make clear that these women should get care, 
many Republicans actually opposed them.
  I really want to emphasize, we are talking about women whose water 
breaks dangerously early or who are experiencing uncontrollable 
hemorrhaging or sepsis or pre-eclampsia. And still, Republicans 
actually filed a brief in court saying, essentially, no, we don't think 
doctors should be required to provide abortion care when a patient's 
life is at stake.

  Their brief rejected that idea--that basic medical reality--of 
abortion as a stabilizing care. That is really shocking to me, and it 
should be shocking to everyone.
  After a brief like that, I am not going to let any of my Republican 
colleagues off the hook just for saying they care about the life of the 
mother--not if they don't lift a finger to actually protect women and 
to actually make clear that emergency care can include abortion.
  We need to send a very clear message on this. The Senate needs to 
speak with one voice and tell the American people: Yes, we want to make 
sure your doctor can save your life. Your doctor can save your life.
  Before my Republican colleagues get up to object, let me be clear. 
You will not get by pretending a resolution like this isn't necessary, 
not when we are hearing now firsthand from doctors racked with guilt 
for decisions that Republican politicians made for them; not when they 
are hearing firsthand from women who have bled, suffered, and nearly 
died because their care was delayed; and, certainly, not when Texas saw 
maternal deaths now skyrocket because of its strict abortion ban. The 
data in Texas paints a clear, brutal picture of the reality. These 
abortion bans are killing women.
  Republicans are also not going to get by trying to shift the blame 
and argue emergency care is already protected because the whole point 
of this resolution is to say emergency care is protected. If you oppose 
the Senate actually saying that, don't you see how this could be part 
of the problem? Don't you see how that could be very dangerous for 
women?
  I can't emphasize this enough. If you don't see and you don't 
understand--listen. Women are speaking out. Doctors are speaking out. 
They are terrified; they are heartbroken; and they

[[Page S6352]]

are angry. And they are watching right now to see if we can just pass 
this simple resolution and do the very bare minimum of saying, with one 
voice, women have a right to get an abortion when their life is at 
stake--when their life is at stake.
  As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from 
further consideration and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 828 on the 
right to emergency healthcare, including abortion care; that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Oklahoma.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. This 
resolution itself and the wording that it has in this resolution says 
it is the sense of the Senate that every person has the basic right to 
emergency healthcare, including abortion care.
  Let me be very, very specific on this. We had a hearing today in the 
Finance Committee where this same subject was addressed. We had ob-gyns 
from both perspectives on this, those who perform abortions and those 
who have a moral objection to it. We had a very good argument to be 
able to lay some facts out to be able to walk through this, with two 
sets of attorneys there to be able to walk through the law.
  Here is what became very clear during that conversation this morning 
in that open hearing. There is no State in America in which a woman 
faces persecution or prosecution for having an abortion. No State 
criminalizes miscarriage. No State criminalizes removing an ectopic 
pregnancy. No States prohibits lifesaving care for the mother. No State 
requires a woman to be actively dying in order for her doctor to care 
for her.
  We heard story after story about doctors being concerned that they 
may face this because they are hearing political rhetoric--political 
rhetoric like Vice President Harris in a speech that she said 
recently--where she said women were being arrested and facing 
prosecution for experiencing miscarriages. That is not true.

  So all of this rhetoric that is being put out there is making doctors 
afraid, but it was very clear from the conversation in law that none of 
those things are actually true. Every physician prior to the Dobbs 
decision--when there were limitations on abortion across the country 
and post-Dobbs decision, when every single State is making those 
decisions--allowed physicians in an ER to be able to make lifesaving 
decisions for the mother and the child. Every doctor has already the 
ability to be able to make that decision to be able to protect the life 
of the mother. They have the protections to be able to do that.
  So this is a false claim that somehow what happened in the Dobbs 
decision and what is happening in the States is limiting that. It is 
actually the political rhetoric that is making people afraid.
  What also came out during the hearing this morning was the very real 
risk of chemical abortions. We have recently had tragic situations 
where women used the chemical abortion pills that they are being told 
are as safe as Tylenol, and that it has life-threatening and in some 
cases, recently, life-taking consequences. Chemical abortion pills are 
not Tylenol, yet they are being sold as that.
  And what we are seeing is more and more cases of the diminishing of 
``this is no big deal to be able to end this pregnancy'' when they 
haven't seen a doctor because the Biden administration is now saying 
you don't have to see a physician. So the woman doesn't know if she has 
an ectopic pregnancy or not. If she takes the chemical abortion pill 
while she has an ectopic pregnancy, she is at risk. But the Biden 
administration is saying: You don't have to see a doctor. They can just 
mail it to you. It is just as safe as Tylenol when it is not.
  We are also not being tested for their blood type to be able to make 
sure it doesn't affect future pregnancies during this chemical 
abortion. And they are not also determining by sonogram how far along 
the mom is in this process because there are limitations to this where 
it becomes more and more dangerous.
  All those things are restrictions that used to be there, that the 
Biden administration has taken away to say: No, we want more people to 
have access to chemical abortions. But it is making it more dangerous 
for women. And we have seen this recently.
  So we want to engage in a conversation about how can we actually put 
some of those basic humane doctor-requested restrictions in there to 
make sure we are protecting the lives of all those women. That is a 
better conversation for us to be able to have. To say: What is it the 
FDA actually said was appropriate in the past, and what can we do to be 
able to protect the lives of women?
  So, yes, I object to this resolution based on the wording and what we 
are doing. But, yes, we should be able to continue to have this 
conversation because there is a real concern that more and more doctors 
are afraid to do basic healthcare in an ER because more and more people 
are laying rhetoric out there that they are going to be arrested, and 
that is not true.
  There has not been a single physician in the country that has been 
arrested based on actually performing lifesaving care for mom in any ER 
room in the country.
  With that, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I disagree with the Senator from 
Oklahoma, and let me be perfectly clear about what is happening. Here 
in America, in the 21st century, pregnant women are suffering and 
dying, not because doctors don't know how to save them, but because 
doctors don't know if Republicans will let them.
  There are skyrocketing maternal death rates in States like Texas, and 
as I spoke out on the floor last week, there are at least two women 
dead in Georgia today because of Republican abortion bans. Those kids 
are now growing up without a mother. That is the harsh reality.
  Republicans can't ignore that. Donald Trump can't shout over it. The 
American people will not ever forget it. And every day we are going to 
continue to hold those people who are opposed to this accountable for 
the cruelty of these abortion bans.
  The fact is that the resolution that I offered simply says that 
doctors can provide emergency care for the life of a mother. I don't 
understand where the disagreement is, and I hope that we can pass this 
and give doctors and women the confidence that, in the United States of 
America, when you are pregnant and having a severe emergency medical 
situation, you will be treated.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.

                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2152

  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support a woman's right 
to control her own body. Across the country, women have been stripped 
of the freedom to make their own decisions--decisions about their 
families, their health, and their futures. Judges and politicians have 
inserted themselves into exam rooms, telling doctors they cannot treat 
their patients, sometimes even if that treatment would save her life.
  In my home State of Wisconsin, women lived for 15 months under a 
criminal abortion ban that was passed in 1849, a law on the books from 
1 year after our statehood and 70 years before a woman won the right to 
vote. And while there were no women in the room when the statute was 
crafted, 2 years ago, Wisconsin women woke up to find their healthcare 
decisions would be dictated by a law that predates the Civil War. They 
woke up to find out that they now had fewer rights than their mothers 
and their grandmothers. That day began 15 months of confusion and chaos 
and heartbreak for families across Wisconsin.
  We heard stories of women bleeding out from miscarriages, developing 
life-threatening infections, or being forced to carry unviable 
pregnancies until they could find an appointment out of State. For 
countless women, that meant driving hours, paying for lodging and 
childcare, and taking time off work just to make their own decisions 
about their own body.
  Patients from every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties traveled to 
Illinois just to access healthcare, some traveling over 500 miles. 
Prior to the Dobbs

[[Page S6353]]

decision, only one in six Wisconsin abortion patients received out-of-
State care. During our criminal abortion ban, that number skyrocketed 
to 9 out of 10 patients seeking care out of State.
  Those families were being forced to drive, on average, 103 minutes to 
exercise their right to control their own bodies and get the care they 
needed, nearly double the time that they drove to access care before 
Roe fell.
  And I am talking here about women who could afford the more than 
$1,000 in costs to access that care. We must also be aware of those who 
could not. For example, patients traveling from out of State had to 
fork up an average of $330 just for lodging.
  In 2023 alone, Illinois and Minnesota providers saw over 6,000 
patients from Wisconsin. You heard me right. Six thousand Wisconsin 
women were forced to travel sometimes hundreds of miles just to access 
healthcare. And even though Wisconsin has restored access to abortion 
in three counties, Planned Parenthood of Illinois is still seeing three 
times as many patients from Wisconsin compared to before the Dobbs 
decision came down. The reality is that abortion care is still only 
available in 3 of our 72 counties.
  Exercising this fundamental freedom is out of reach for far too many 
in America. Twenty-two States across the country have abortion bans, 
and that means one in three women of reproductive age live in a State 
where they cannot get the healthcare they need because politicians are 
telling them that they know better.
  Well, women and families deserve better. That is why last year I 
introduced the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act to give millions of 
women without access to care in their home States a lifeline. This bill 
would ease the tremendous financial burden Republican abortion bans 
have placed squarely on women who are trying to access critical care. 
Women are spending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to pay for 
travel, lodging, meals, and childcare just to make their own healthcare 
decisions.
  These past 2 years we have heard shocking stories of women, often 
desperate for help, having nowhere to turn. Last week, we even heard 
the story of a woman who died because she was denied abortion care 
until it was too late.
  If my colleagues insist that this issue is a decision for the States 
and not for women, then I hope that they can at least recognize the 
tremendous hardship their patchwork of laws has created.
  The rights you have as an American should not depend upon what State 
you live in. If we cannot restore Roe this Congress, we should, at the 
very least, extend a lifeline to the millions of women who are unable 
to access care in their own communities.
  So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 2152, the Reproductive Health Travel Fund 
Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the 
bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Alabama.
  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if my 
Democrat colleagues were honest, they would call this bill what it 
really is: the ``Elective Abortion Travel Slush Fund for All Act.'' 
This bill authorizes 350 million taxpayer dollars for radical abortion 
groups to facilitate elective abortions.
  And this money isn't limited to Americans. It would also give 
taxpayer money to noncitizens--illegal aliens--who are seeking 
abortions. This bill would use Federal funds to cover the cost of 
flights, food, hotels, and other expenses for any individual in the 
United States seeking abortion, paid for by the American taxpayers. It 
would even cover lost wages for those traveling to get abortion.
  Fifty million dollars of taxpayer money in this bill would go 
directly to groups like Planned Parenthood to pay for advertising, 
website development, increasing staff, and building maintenance and 
construction, all of which will go to encouraging--if not coercing--
women to get abortions, not to seek alternatives.
  Now, there is a major inconvenient fact that Senate Democrats are 
ignoring: The Hyde amendment is clear, no taxpayer funds may be used 
for abortion. My colleagues will say: Well, no, this money isn't paying 
for abortions. But let's be clear. This taxpayer money is being used 
for one purpose: to take the lives of unborn children.
  While the actual abortion procedures aren't covered by this bill, it 
covers every other cost associated with ensuring abortions happen.
  Democrats know the Hyde amendment prevents and prohibits Federal 
dollars funding abortions. It has been the law of the land for 48 
years. It was democratically agreed to then, and it still stands today. 
Still, today, 60 percent of voters agree with the Hyde amendment--on 
both sides of the aisle--that taxpayer dollars should not be used for 
abortions. I am sure that percentage is even higher for illegals 
getting taxpayer money for abortions.
  But Democrats really don't care. Despite what they say, they will 
override American voters if democracy gets in the way of their latest 
leftwing pet project.
  Democrats know States have democratically decided what their laws on 
abortions are. Now they are trying to override the will of the people 
and the will of the States by using the Federal Government and millions 
of taxpayer dollars to achieve their goal. This is not only counter to 
the spirit of the Hyde amendment, it is contrary to the principles of 
federalism and the will of the American people.
  As I pointed out for months last year with a similar illegal abortion 
policy Secretary Lloyd Austin implemented at the Department of Defense, 
no Agency--no Agency--is above the law. I called out the VA for 
implementing another illegal abortion policy.
  This bill is just another page--another page--out of the Democrats' 
same extreme abortion playbook. This bill is a flimsy attempt to go 
around the law of the land.
  Gone are the days of the Democrats saying abortions should be safe, 
legal, and rare. Democrats today want dangerous, illegal, and limitless 
abortions at any cost--any cost--to the American taxpayers.
  So for that reason, Mr. President, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Wisconsin.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the objection and 
will agree with the Senator on one point, which is that this bill does 
not fund abortion.
  The Senator referred to democratically passed laws relating to this 
subject, and I just wanted to remind him once more what I said in my 
opening statement: In Wisconsin, women lived for 15 months under a 
criminal abortion ban that was passed in 1849--70 years before women 
had the right to vote, before the Civil War. Obviously women had no 
input in that democratically enacted law.
  But this bill simply breaks down a barrier that Americans are facing 
to access sometimes lifesaving care, a financial barrier, I might add, 
that Republicans put up when they inserted themselves into our exam 
rooms and into women's personal decisions.
  I hope my Republican colleagues understand that women take notice 
when you vote down bills that protect and defend their basic freedoms. 
They see who is fighting for their right to control their bodies, 
health, families, and future.
  I am proud to be standing here today on their behalf. This issue is 
not going away. We are going to keep fighting day in and day out 
because women want their rights and freedoms back.
  Some of my colleagues are claiming that this is merely a messaging 
bill. Well, send Americans the message that you support their decisions 
to make their own healthcare choices and pass this bill into law.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.

               ENHANCED PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY ACT OF 2024

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, last week, in both the House and 
the Senate, legislation was introduced to

[[Page S6354]]

increase the Secret Service protection for Presidential and Vice 
Presidential nominees. We all know why this legislation is needed. In 
the span of just 65 days, President Trump, our former President and the 
Republican nominee to be the next President of the United States, has 
been the target of two assassination attempts.
  In Butler, PA, President Trump was shot in the head but miraculously 
was spared from death. Unfortunately, Fire Chief Corey Comperatore was 
killed by the assassin's bullets, and others were gravely injured by 
his gunfire. Then it happened again in my home State of Florida.
  It is thanks to the incredible work of President Trump's Secret 
Service detail that another would-be assassin was unable to take a shot 
at the President while he was golfing with friends. We know that day 
could have ended much differently. We thank God that these attempts 
have not been successful. But each of these events has reminded the 
Nation of the dangers surrounding President Trump and the need to make 
sure he, his family, and those around him are safe. That is why I 
introduced the Protect Our Presidents Act here in the Senate and 
Representatives Mike Lawler and Ritchie Torres introduced the Enhanced 
Presidential Security Act in the House.
  The safety and security of those seeking to lead our Nation should 
never be in jeopardy and should be applied regardless of party. That is 
why these bills ensure all Presidential nominees, both now and in the 
future, are provided the enhanced protection they clearly require and 
deserve.
  On Friday, the House passed Representatives Lawler and Torres's bill 
in a unanimous vote of 405 to 0. This unanimous vote shows that when 
commonsense and desperately needed legislation come before Congress, we 
can act quickly to do what the American people expect of us.
  I am proud to lead this effort in the Senate, and I am on the floor 
today to request the immediate passage of the Enhanced Presidential 
Security Act so we can send this good and necessary bill to President 
Biden's desk so it may become law.
  Our action today goes beyond the simple language of this bill to 
increase the Secret Service protection for our party's Presidential and 
Vice Presidential nominees. Passing the Enhanced Presidential Security 
Act today, with the unanimous consent of the Senate, sends an important 
message to the American public and the world that we will not ignore 
these threats, which are truly an attack on our democratic process and 
have rightly shocked the world.
  As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 9106, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helmy). The clerk will report the bill by 
title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 9106) to direct the Director of the United 
     States Secret Service to apply the same standards for 
     determining the number of agents required to protect 
     Presidents, Vice Presidents, and major Presidential and Vice 
     Presidential candidates, and for other purposes.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to the 
measure?
  The Senator from Connecticut.
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me make 
it clear that I share Senator Scott's concern--deep concern--that the 
recent attacks on former President Trump's life have made it clear that 
there are security gaps in his protection. What happened in Butler and 
Palm Beach was unacceptable, and it cannot be allowed to happen again.
  That is why this week, Congress is coming together, poised to pass a 
continuing resolution that I hope the Senator will support that will 
give the Secret Service $231 million in additional funding to provide 
the Agency with the authority to spend money at a faster rate so that 
they can meet their mission, and their mission is ``zero fail.''
  I am the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Homeland Security, which is charged with funding the Secret Service. I 
am proud of the quick work that we have done to identify the funds that 
can be spent between now and the election and between now and the 
inauguration to make sure that any gaps are closed.
  The reason that I rise on this particular bill, though, is because I 
don't want to promise the American public more than this bill actually 
delivers.
  This bill says that the Secret Service shall use ``the same standards 
for determining the number of agents required to protect Presidents, 
Vice Presidents, and major Presidential and Vice Presidential 
candidates.'' Now, that may sound meaningful, but in reality, my sense 
is that that is current law.
  Right now, when the Secret Service makes a determination on the 
provision of protection, it is assessing the protectee's life, their 
work, their travel patterns, the potential threats, and the risk of 
harm to that person. The standard that the Secret Service uses is to 
provide whatever protection level is necessary to meet that ``zero 
fail'' mission to protect the person under their charge. With a team of 
experts, the Secret Service determines the level and the type of 
protection that is needed. That is the process, and those are the 
existing standards.
  Let's be clear. Commanders in Chief--Presidents of the United 
States--do have certain unique requirements regarding their protection. 
For instance, the Department of Defense is supplying a traveling 
Commander in Chief with certain capabilities, chiefly amongst them the 
ability to stay in contact with our nuclear triad and communication 
assets necessary for the President to be in seamless communication with 
the Department of Defense and military command should a crisis arise. 
That is a unique set of capabilities that a Commander in Chief has, and 
it goes into the assessment that the Secret Service makes as to the 
level of protection that the Commander in Chief needs.
  They are using the same standard--do whatever is necessary in order 
to protect the life of the protectee--but Commanders in Chief, because 
they are Commanders in Chief, have a different constellation of assets 
that surround them that mean that the standard gets applied 
accordingly.
  So I am not actually going to object. I am not sure that this bill 
changes anything about the way the Secret Service approaches their 
mission. They are going to continue to do whatever is necessary in 
order to protect the detailee, to protect the individual under their 
mandate. I think the much more substantive thing we are going to do 
this week is to get them the resources they need. My hope is that all 
of my Republican colleagues who have been talking about the importance 
of Secret Service protection are willing to support this increase in 
funding that the continuing resolution will include.
  I will end by expressing my additional hope that we will seek to have 
a more holistic conversation here about how to protect former President 
Trump, how to protect President Biden, and how to protect Vice 
President Harris.
  I am ready to move forward with this bill. I don't think it does 
anything to meaningfully change the way that the Secret Service 
approaches their job. I am ready to move forward on additional assets.
  But we also continue to choose to give weapons of mass destruction to 
assassins. Other nations around the world don't choose to hand weapons 
with such accurate long-range capabilities, such powerful destructive 
force, to these assassins whose brains are breaking.
  We also have a constellation of actors in this country who are 
engaged in a web of conspiracy theories. There is a justification of 
political violence that exists in this country today--apologies for 
those people who tried to kill us, attacked us on January 6--that leads 
many others to contemplate that they will also be let off the hook for 
their acts of political violence.
  So I take the protection of former President Trump and Vice President 
Harris and everyone under Secret Service protection very seriously.
  Let's move ahead with this bill. I don't think it actually solves the 
problem. Let's pass the additional money so that they have everything 
they need--the Secret Service--in order to get the job done. Then let's 
sit down and have a broader conversation about why we have seen this 
spike in political violence and what other ways Republicans and 
Democrats can come together.

[[Page S6355]]

  Only by having that comprehensive conversation about funding, about 
the lethal means of assassination, about the celebration of political 
violence that happens in this country will we really do the job that is 
necessary and help the Secret Service reach their ``zero fail'' 
mission.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, H.R. 9106, the Enhanced Presidential 
Security Act, passed the House of Representatives last week and is 
currently pending in the Senate. As chair of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the U.S. Secret Service, I would 
like to offer a few thoughts on this legislation, which I support.
  The bill requires the Director of the Secret Service to follow the 
same standards for determining agent staffing levels for the President, 
Vice President, and major Presidential and Vice Presidential 
candidates. The bill also directs the Secret Service to conduct an 
internal review of its protection authorities and submit to Congress a 
report that includes recommendations for improvements.
  Since the first assassination attempt on former President Donald 
Trump, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland and 
Government Affairs Committee have received a classified briefing and 
held a joint hearing where we heard testimony from the Secret Service 
and the FBI. We have worked on a bipartisan basis to get to the bottom 
of how the Secret Service failed to protect former President Trump on 
July 13.
  Following the awful events of July 13 in Butler, PA, the Secret 
Service elevated the posture of its protectees and bolstered protective 
details to ensure the highest levels of safety and security.
  Specifically, former President Trump is receiving additional 
personnel and protective assets at levels comparable to that of the 
President of the United States.
  Additionally, the Secret Service has dedicated available protective 
assets typically reserved for the President to the Vice President and 
both Vice Presidential candidates.
  H.R. 9106 serves to capture in statute these efforts undertaken by 
the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security to dedicate 
critical resources and personnel to mitigate the inherent risk in the 
protection of the President, Vice President, and other major 
Presidential candidates who seek our Nation's highest office in this 
heightened threat environment.
  I am concerned that the bill does not address the recruitment and 
retention challenges that have been perennial problems for the Agency. 
With the Secret Service now providing the same protections to 
candidates that it does for the sitting President, the strains on 
available agents will become even more apparent. Congress must continue 
working to address these issues.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding?
  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I further ask that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 9106) was ordered to a third reading, was read the 
third time, and passed.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues 
for their support of this commonsense legislation, which has now passed 
with unanimous, bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives.
  I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure nominees for 
President and Vice President are never in jeopardy and are provided the 
enhanced protection they clearly require and deserve.
  This bill will now go to President Biden's desk, and I hope he acts 
quickly to sign it into law.

                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.
  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, welcome to the Senate. You look good up 
there.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you, sir.








[Pages S6355-S6356]
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]



               Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services is seemingly doing everything they can to prevent our 
veterans and seniors from receiving quality long-term care. That is 
their mission, but they seem to be doing everything they can to prevent 
it.
  Instead of working to ensure quality care for our veterans and 
seniors, the Agency seems hyperfocused on what appears to be a 
warpath--a warpath to push long-term care facilities to their limit. 
Rather than listening to the substantial feedback from facilities and 
managers, healthcare leaders, and Members of Congress, the Agency 
insists on implementing these overbearing, unrealistic rules and 
procedures to flex its bureaucratic muscle, as if to just show us how 
big their muscles are.
  The actions of CMS are far beyond misguided, and the result is the 
intentional--it seems to me--disregard for the actual safety and care 
of the seniors and veterans they are charged to care for.
  In North Dakota, our facilities are really feeling the squeeze, and 
the issue is really twofold. First and most importantly for my State, 
the minimum staffing rule--the minimum staffing rule. In an attempt to 
ensure adequate staffing levels, CMS went over the top. In May, CMS 
issued this minimum staffing rule which requires long-term care 
facilities to implement new staffing requirements. Now, these are 
institutions that are already woefully understaffed because of a lack 
of a workforce.
  Most burdensome is the new requirement to have a registered nurse--a 
registered nurse--on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, rather than 
the previous 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. Less than a quarter of North 
Dakota's facilities meet this requirement, and among rural facilities 
only 14 percent will meet that mandate.
  And we should make no mistake, this is an unfunded, one-size-fits-all 
mandate coming from the bureaucratic bullies at CMS. In fact, by CMS's 
own lowball estimates, this regulation--it is almost hard for me to say 
this number. By their low-ball estimates, this regulation will cost 
facilities over $40 billion to comply. Why would you want to impose $40 
billion more of unproductive costs on our facilities that are there to 
care for our seniors and our veterans?
  To meet these elevated staffing levels, our facilities really have no 
good options, if they have any options at all. At existing staff 
levels, North Dakota facilities would need to reduce the average number 
of residents served per day by about 74 people to satisfy this mandate. 
Let me say that again: To meet this mandate, North Dakota facilities 
would have to reduce--reduce--the people they care for by 74.
  They are being required to hire more staff from a supply of 
registered nurses that simply does not exist. I don't know why they 
would be surprised by this. We have a nursing shortage. Hello, CMS. 
Wake up. Listen to one or two people, and you will know we have a 
nursing shortage in this country, and it is particularly challenging in 
rural America.
  Now, if they don't get that, if they don't find the nurses, of 
course, they do have the option of reducing the number of seniors they 
serve, as I mentioned earlier, or just closing their doors entirely. 
That doesn't seem to meet the stated goal of CMS.
  It is also clear that this rule will disproportionally harm our 
small, rural States like North Dakota, as I said, and certainly our 
rural facilities. These are the same facilities already struggling to 
stay open. In my State, we have had six facilities close since 2021, 
indicating the already challenging operating environment, and I fear 
this misguided rule will supercharge this trend and deprive rural 
individuals--remember, these are people, CMS; rural individuals, 
people--the opportunity to receive care in their home communities, near 
the people they love and know the best: their families and their 
friends, their loved ones.
  Mr. President, this math just doesn't add up. How does CMS not 
understand that this mandate is impossible to meet? Or maybe they do. I

they maybe actually do understand that. CMS's intransigence seems to 
imply that it doesn't care.
  Every State will feel the negative impact of this rule, but rural 
States like mine will be hurt the most.
  I have sent letters advising CMS to hold off on this one-size-fits-
all rule as far back as January of last year, and I have questioned CMS 
officials at hearings about the mandate's impact on already stressed 
staffing challenges.
  And opposition to this rule has been bipartisan. It has been across 
the aisle and across the Capitol. In one example, Senator King and I 
sent a second letter last October before introducing a bill together in 
March to require the Veterans' Affairs to study the CMS rule's impact 
on our war heroes, our veterans. Again, in June, we made the same 
request in a letter.
  I also cosponsored a bipartisan Congressional Review Act resolution 
of disapproval in June to overturn the rule CMS is so unwilling to 
modify.
  In addition, litigation is ongoing in two Federal districts, both of 
which argue the Agency exceeded its statutory authority and the rule 
should be set aside. It is not uncommon for Agencies lately to overstep 
their legal boundaries.
  Our concerns have simply, to this point, fallen on deaf ears at CMS.
  The minimum staffing rule is part of a broader pattern of CMS's 
bureaucratic crackdowns on facilities for no reason other than it can.
  And that is what bothers me so much about bureaucratic bullies is 
they are bullies because they can be, without materially improving the 
health and safety of long-care residents. Again, that is their goal--
supposedly, that is their goal.
  This brings me to the second part of the issue impacting our long-
term care facilities. They are called civil monetary penalties or, in 
bureaucratic speak, CMPs. They are punitive monetary actions that CMS 
can take against long-term care facilities in situations where CMS 
determines they do not substantially comply with Medicare or Medicaid 
participation requirements, the requirements that the bullies create 
out of thin air. These penalties are heavily used to punish facilities 
beyond a simple correction. The goal should be to help them comply, not 
to punish them.
  During a survey visit of a facility--just for instance--an inspector 
can issue citations for a range of violations. The inspector has the 
ability to issue citations based on perceived severity, ranging from no 
actual harm up to immediate jeopardy, which indicates an issue or 
situation that puts a resident's health or safety at imminent risk--
again, as determined by CMS.
  The problem only begins with the initial citation, however. CMS can 
still issue additional citations following the survey or the visit, 
sometimes many months later. I will try to explain this as simply as I 
can so you get the sense of just how awful this is. The Agency 
continues to expand its ability to issue these citations and related 
penalties to exert even more control over the facilities. And there is 
where the real issue is: control over you.
  The irony here is that for every dollar spent on a penalty is one 
less dollar invested in staff, the facility itself, equipment, anything 
that might enhance the care for the senior or the veteran.
  Our seniors and veterans certainly deserve to live in safe, regulated 
facilities. But this is not about letting facilities off the hook when 
infractions occur; rather, this is about the avalanche of penalties 
facilities face after a single infraction and the consequences of 
excess fines.
  But it gets worse. CMS has updated its ability--remember, every time 
I reference what CMS is doing with regulations or updating, that is 
them arbitrarily, individually, unilaterally making up lies. For your 
benefit? I don't think so. So they updated their ability to impose 
these penalties for up to three survey cycles. What does that mean? 
Most of these survey cycles--these are the visits, again, by a 
regulator. Most of them include inspections on average of every 12 
months. To simplify the math, what this means is paper-pushing bullies 
in Washington could issue another penalty from the comfort of their 
desks on top of the original penalty imposed at the time of the survey. 
They don't even have to leave their desk. In fact, I suspect many of 
them never have, except the ones that now work from home--that work 
from home. This could be months or years later and without ever having 
to set foot in a facility or in a State other than the District of 
Columbia and the surrounding counties.

  So what is the purpose of these additional delayed penalties? Who 
thinks this would be a good idea? Well, it is certainly not about 
taking immediate action to enhance the care or to help them comply and 
help the safety of residents or addressing noncompliance during the 
visit itself. No.
  To make matters worse, for certain citations--now, get this. When I 
read this, I had to check on it and check on it to make sure this is 
true. For certain citations, facilities are financially incentivized 
not to challenge the findings. Let me say that again because it is 
almost too hard to believe.
  For certain citations, facilities are financially incentivized not to 
challenge the findings. Isn't that rich? In fact, CMS offers a 35-
percent extortion discount to facilities if they waive their right to a 
hearing and just simply accept the penalties from the bureaucratic 
bully that was imposed. This, of course, only further empowers the 
bully and allows the initial citations to stand undisputed. It is 
unconscionable. I can't even believe it is legal; and maybe it is not.
  I hesitate to even share this, but I feel I have to. I have had 
facility managers in my home State plead with me not to use their 
specific example for fear of retaliation from the bureaucracy, the very 
people who are supposed to be helping provide safe, reliable care for 
our veterans and our seniors.
  The recently finalized skilled nursing facility rule introduced yet 
another way to punish facilities with the addition of--get this--per 
instance per day civil monetary penalties. Only a bureaucrat could love 
a title like that. This is what's called an instance multiplier of 
fines--an instance multiplier of fines--based on the number of 
residents impacted or the number of times the conduct is repeated. It 
is another flawed approach as citations already account for this. When 
the initial citation is issued, it accounts for scope. It accounts for 
how insulated the incident is or pattern, how widespread the pattern 
may be. All of that is calculated into the initial citation.
  But if that is not good enough, they can always go back and say: You 
know what? Let's multiply instances and see if we can't punish them a 
little bit more so maybe they could close down.
  If these rules and penalties were really about better care for 
residents, CMS should yield to reason. However, the actions of the 
bureaucrats at CMS prove they are out of touch--simply out of touch--
with operational challenges actually facing these facilities and the 
people that the facilities serve. If they, in fact, want to achieve the 
stated goal of improving quality, well, these decisions do just the 
opposite. In fact, what they do is they reduce choice and access and, 
ultimately, they lead to facilities closing.
  I don't think that is the goal. It is not the stated goal. Maybe it 
is somebody's goal, but it is not the stated goal. I hope those with 
the ability to do something about it enter reality one of these days 
and listen to our warnings. They are real. These are real people living 
in real places.
  And, yes, they might be in red States--I am sorry, some of them are. 
A lot of these rural places are. But that is not your job to worry 
about the politics.
  I have little faith that they are going to do the right thing and 
reverse course, but I pray they will.
  I yield the floor.

                        Artificial Intelligence

  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to again call on my 
colleagues across the aisle to take action to put in place commonsense 
guardrails to address the risk that artificial intelligence poses to 
our elections.
  There are some incredible innovations that we are seeing and will see 
as a result of AI, and our country is in the lead. I want those 
innovations to be good, and I want us to lead the world as we have for 
so long, but if we don't put some commonsense rules in place, such as 
the bill Senator Thune and I have, to create a regulatory framework for

[[Page S6357]]

nondefense applications or some of the other bipartisan bills that have 
come out of the Commerce Committee, I think that we are going to lose 
the positive for the negative. So I am trying to look at some 
commonsense rules, and one of the most obvious ways that we can put 
some rules in place is when it comes to democracy, which, to me, is 
kind of a hair-on-fire moment.
  Like any emerging technology, as we know, AI brings both opportunity 
and uncertainty. As columnist David Brooks has said, the people in AI 
seem to be experiencing radically different brain states all at once.
  He said:

       I've found it incredibly hard to write about AI because it 
     is literally unknowable whether this technology is leading us 
     to heaven or hell.

  So we want it to lead us to heaven, and we want to get those new 
cures for medical diseases, and I have seen the work done right in my 
own State at Mayo.
  But one of the things that we must do--and Senator Schumer and 
Senators Heinrich and Rounds and Young have been leading the way--is to 
find a group of bills that we could actually pass, and perhaps we could 
do this at the end of the year. The ones that I would like to see 
today--which I know cannot happen as we work on the budget but at least 
by the end of the year--is to do something when it comes to democracy 
and the kind of videos and fake robocalls and things that we are seeing 
that could be a dangerous--and have already been a dangerous--threat to 
our democracy.
  Maybe the first time this kind of hit the national conscience was 
something that wasn't actually created by AI. It was actually the 
voice. It turned out to be the voice of a magician who pretended that 
he was President Biden; and in the New Hampshire primary, he called 
people and said that they should not vote. That case, fortunately, has 
been taken up in New Hampshire by the prosecutors and is being 
investigated and prosecuted.
  These are the kinds of things, when in the hands of AI, are going to 
get very dangerous because we are not going to know whether or not it 
is Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. We are not going to know if it is 
really them or if it is a fake. We are already seeing videos and voices 
and things, so I am asking my colleagues to join with me to do what 
people have already done in so many States, including in red States.
  Texas--Texas--has a ban on deepfakes. Minnesota has a ban on 
deepfakes. States like Mississippi and Utah have put in labeling 
requirements so that at least you know if something is being created by 
AI; so when an innocent citizen looks at the video or looks at the ad, 
they see that at the bottom.
  And not everything is the same. If you use AI to, say, change your 
hair color or do something to make someone look better, that doesn't 
come under at least the bills that we have for Federal elections that 
we are proposing. But if you actually are trying to mislead voters 
about whether or not it is actually the person, that would come under 
the bill that Senators Hawley and Collins and I--yes, that is right--
that Senators Hawley and Collins and Coons and I and a number of others 
have introduced that would simply say: Once you do something like that, 
then you have to take it down.
  We have a number of platforms, including open AI and Microsoft and 
others, that are supporting this bill. This is not some kind of radical 
idea. We haven't had any serious pushback for this particular bill 
because we were so careful in drafting it. We understood that we 
couldn't include, say, satire. When you have a satire, a joke thing 
that comes out, the Constitution says you can't really ban that, right? 
That's speech.
  But for those kinds of products, we think you should at least say on 
it--which is allowed; this is what all these States have done--
``produced by AI.'' That is the bill that Senator Murkowski and I 
have--the Republican across our aisle, my friend from Alaska. So these 
are both bipartisan bills, and I am urging my colleagues to look at 
them.
  Election day is now less than 45 days away. We have voters already 
casting their ballots, and absentee ballots have been mailed out. 
Truly, this is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is an 
American issue. People should be able to know that, when they see a 
candidate, it is the candidate.
  We have a number of bills, as I said, that are before us, and I want 
people to know--and my colleague from Georgia, the Acting President pro 
tempore, is well aware--of how people can try to mess with elections. 
His words would probably be more straightforward than any words I will 
say today when it comes to trying to stop people from voting or feeding 
them with information. Sometimes it just comes down to some people 
don't want some people to vote. That is what that radio ad was about--
radio; I am sorry--that call that was made in New Hampshire was all 
about: trying to get people not to vote or to think things are so bad 
that they don't want to vote for the person.
  But there is something even more insidious going on, and that is that 
we have heard from our intelligence Agencies that foreign adversaries, 
like Iran, China, and Russia, are trying to interfere with our 
democracy.
  Just this month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
issued a public report confirming this. In May, the Director of 
National Intelligence, Avril Haines, testified about an increase in 
foreign influence efforts and how AI can make it easier to amplify 
deceptive content. By the way, this has happened before in our 
elections, and it has happened around the world. It is not necessarily, 
in some cases, directed at the right or the left. The foreign interest 
just decides: Well, what do I want to mess around? Sometimes, as in the 
past, Russia just wants to mess around--mess around with the right or 
with the left--just to create chaos.
  FBI Director Christopher Wray echoed this concern when he said that 
the U.S. will face more adversaries moving at a faster pace enabled by 
new technology. And the Department of Justice took action 3 weeks ago 
to disrupt Russian Government-backed efforts to interfere in our 
election, which includes the use of AI to spread disinformation online.
  We have seen this technology being used to generate viral misleading 
content to spread disinformation and deceive voters about candidates 
from both parties.
  In July, as I note, there was just recently the deepfake of Vice 
President Harris's voice saying things she never would say about 
President Biden. According to reports, it was seen more than 130 
million times in just 4 days. Now, you know, maybe if you were to watch 
the whole thing, you would know that it is not her. Not everyone does 
that, right? You look at snippets on the internet; you look at part of 
it. Again, I had people say ``wow'' to me. I know that seems strange 
for people who are in the Beltway, and they watch everything, but if 
you just watch something for a few seconds, you may not know whether or 
not it is actually the candidate or not. That is why, in this case--
because it was arguably satire--you would at least have a label through 
the whole thing, and that would be a requirement if we pass the bill 
Senator Murkowski and I have.
  Earlier this month, Taylor Swift talked about how AI was being used 
to make it look like she endorsed a candidate that she didn't even 
endorse. As the election approaches, now is when disinformation can 
have its biggest impact and when we could possibly see the worst of the 
worst.
  So whether you are Democrat or Republican, no one wants to see fake 
ads or robocalls when you cannot even tell if it is the candidate you 
love or the candidate you don't like. That is why, as I note, 19 States 
across the country--red, blue, and purple--have passed laws in this 
area.
  On the Federal level, the bill I have with Senator Collins and 
Senator Hawley is sitting there. We got it through the Rules Committee. 
But unfortunately our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have 
blocked this bill from being considered in the past when I asked 
unanimous consent for it.
  I note it is a bipartisan bill. It is supported by 40 national 
security experts and current and former government officials, including 
former Secretaries of Defense Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta and 
Secretaries of State from both parties. It is supported by former 
Federal Election Commission Chairman Trevor

[[Page S6358]]

Potter, who was appointed by a Republican President. I mentioned 
OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, and Salesforce supporting the bill. It has a 
bipartisan companion bill led by Representatives Derek Kilmer of 
Washington and Tony Gonzales, a Republican from Texas.
  We must get this done.
  At this point, we are going to have to now rely on the platform--some 
of whom have policies in place--to take down these fake ads and these 
fake videos. Many of them have committed to do so. But those are not 
all the platforms, and we are much better off if we have standard 
legislation across the country that doesn't preempt the State laws for 
their own work but actually sets a standard for Federal elections--
President, Senate, and Congress.
  So I hope this isn't as bad as I think it is going to be through 
October, but I think we are already seeing signs that it is. That is 
not democracy. We cannot have a functioning democracy if our people 
can't tell if it is their candidate or not. It is going to make things 
much, much worse.
  We can't stand on the sidelines. Let's work together for the sake of 
our democracy to put in place commonsense rules of the road on AI to 
uphold trust and faith in our election. I stand ready to work with our 
colleagues in any way to get this done.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kelly). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 9747

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate receives H.R. 9747 from the House, the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; that there be up to 2 hours for debate, 
equally divided, and with no amendments or motions in order to the 
bill; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be 
considered read a third time and the Senate vote on the passage of the 
bill, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there is very good news tonight. I have 
just locked in an agreement to pass the government funding bill 
tomorrow, without amendment, and avoid an unnecessary government 
shutdown.
  American families can rest assured now that their lives won't be 
needlessly upended due to an unnecessary government shutdown. This 
agreement ensures that the Senate will take up the CR after the House 
passes it tomorrow, which is well before the September 30 deadline.
  The CR will give Congress more time to continue working on the 
appropriations process to fund the government before the end of the 
year.
  As I have said all year, the only way to get things done is with 
bipartisan support--bipartisan support.
  Now, I appreciate the work of all the leaders to move forward with 
this CR. This is how things should be done--without brinksmanship, 
without delay. I hope--I truly hope--we will continue to see the same 
bipartisanship in the Senate when we return and we work to fund the 
government.

                   RECOGNIZING MICHELIN NORTH AMERICA

<bullet> Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Michelin North America on its 50th anniversary of 
operating in South Carolina and 35 years of being headquartered in 
Greenville, SC.
  Michelin produced its first tire in South Carolina in 1975 and now 
employs 10,000 people across 15 facilities throughout the State. As a 
global leader in producing tires, Michelin has significantly 
contributed to the community and the region, generating an economic 
impact of $266 billion. Michelin has provided steady employment for 
many of the most talented workers in our State, providing thousands of 
jobs and, in many cases, lifelong careers.
  Again, congratulations to Michelin and its employees on celebrating 
50 years in the great State of South Carolina.<bullet>

                        RECOGNIZING DUSTED CHARM

<bullet> Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize 
an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American 
entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize 
Dusted Charm of Council Bluffs, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week.
  In 2017, Becca Wiggins' world was turned upside down when her 
daughter Maisy was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy type 1. She 
left her job to care for Maisy and began to sell various graphic t-
shirt styles out of her basement. Before she knew it, Becca was seeing 
a profit that she knew meant there was a demand for her products. Becca 
expanded her business, and in 2018, she and her family opened Dusted 
Charm. The business is located on the historic 100-block of West 
Broadway, where the team transformed an old clothing shop into Dusted 
Charm's warehouse and showroom. They now offer a wide range of women's 
clothing and home decor, including signs, candles, and pillows. In 
2020, Becca and her team launched a Dusted Charm app that allowed them 
to expand nationally. With their newfound success, this summer Becca 
opened a second store, Shop The Outskirts, on Main Street in Underwood, 
IA.
  Dusted Charm was inspired by the gravel roads and street signs that 
Becca and her family passed on their drives to Maisy's treatments in 
Chicago. Becca's mother Tracy and sisters Rachel and Sara are part 
owners of the business, handling various aspects of it. The family has 
dedicated their time to make this business truly a family-owned and 
operated business that centers around giving back to the community that 
supported them through Maisy's health crisis.
  Dusted Charm is deeply involved with the Council Bluffs community. 
Becca, inspired by the support her family received after Maisy's 
diagnosis, cofounded Maisy and Marley's Purpose, a nonprofit 
organization that aims to bridge financial gaps for families during a 
critical medical diagnosis, a time of loss, or equipment needs. Maisy 
and Marley's Purpose raises funds for various projects, such as 
mortgage payments, constructing an inclusive playground, and acquiring 
service dogs. To further give back to the community, 8 months out of 
the year, Dusted Charm organizes ``Give Back'' days where they donate 
25 percent of all sales to a designated charity. The focus of each 
charity is different, ranging from local sports teams to the Women's 
Fund of Southwest Iowa. In 2022, Dusted Charm was honored with the 
Omaha Metropolitan Area Tourism Award as the best retail business in 
Pottawattamie County.
  Dusted Charm has quickly become a staple in Pottawattamie County due 
to its community outreach and desire to give back. I want to 
congratulate this family and the team at Dusted Charm for their 
commitment to the communities of southwest Iowa. I look forward to 
witnessing their continued growth and positive impact in Iowa.<bullet>

                                 ______
                                 

                        TRIBUTE TO DAN ALLHANDS

<bullet> Mr. DAINES, Mr. President, today I have the honor of 
recognizing Madison County Commissioner, District No. 1, Dan Allhands 
for his lifelong contributions to the citizens of Madison County.
  Dan took the oath of office for county commissioner in 2017 and is 
retiring this year. His district includes the towns of Alder, Sheridan, 
and Virginia City--the historic Montana town that became the second 
territorial capital in 1864, as well as one of the most prominent 
cities in the Rocky Mountains at that time.
  Dan's service as an elected commissioner has capped off decades of 
service to the Ruby Valley and its residents. He was a member of the 
Alder Fire Department for 12 years, including fire chief for 3 years, 
during which a new firehall was constructed. During his tenure on the 
Sheridan School Board, the local elementary school was built. He was a 
rancher for 43 years and raised on his family's ranch in Sheridan. He 
praises his wife Jody and their four sons for continuing to support him 
and the folks in their hometown.
  Whether it is representing local ranchers, collaborative groups, or 
the residents in the county's two local nursing care centers, Dan 
Allhands always embraced a variety of challenges in order to make sure 
Madison County will be ready for a successful future.
  It is my distinct honor to recognize Dan Allhands for his passion to 
serve and his lifelong commitment in making Madison County a better 
place to live and work. ``Montana Proud!''<bullet>

       RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARHAWK AIR MUSEUM

<bullet> Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 35th 
anniversary of the Warhawk Air Museum in Nampa, ID. This remarkable 
institution is a global attraction for history enthusiasts and airplane 
lovers of all ages.
  The museum's roots trace back to 1986, when John and Sue Paul moved 
to Idaho from California, bringing with them a PT-19 WWII trainer, a P-
40E, and their passion for restoring World War II airplanes. They 
worked out of a hangar at the Caldwell airport, bringing planes back to 
life and flying them as they could. The community quickly fell in love 
with these historic aircraft, often gathering to watch them soar 
through the Treasure Valley skies. Inspired by the planes' history, 
residents began contributing their own WWII

[[Page S6362]]

memorabilia to the Pauls' hangar, hoping to create a meaningful tribute 
to U.S. history. The community's enthusiasm culminated in the official 
establishment of the Warhawk Air Museum in 1989.
  As the collection of war memorabilia expanded, John and Sue outgrew 
the original hangar. Looking to construct a larger facility, they found 
a unique way to help fund the endeavor: Hollywood. Because of the 
authenticity on display at the Warhawk, the museum's Curtiss P-40N 
``Warhawk'' and Curtiss P-40E ``Kittyhawk'' were featured in the 2001 
movie ``Pearl Harbor.'' Proceeds enabled the Pauls to construct a new 
facility in Nampa, which opened its doors in 2001. Motivated by their 
success and larger facility, John and Sue sought to expand their 
collection to honor veterans from all eras. With additional proceeds 
from the use of their Curtiss P-40E ``Kittyhawk'' in the 2008 film 
``Valkyrie,'' the museum expanded again, creating a space to honor 
those who served in Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War-era. The public 
can see both of these P-40 aircraft on display every year at the 
museum's annual Warbird Roundup, which brings historic planes from 
around the country to Idaho for an airshow that takes spectators back 
in time.
  Beyond preserving physical artifacts, the Warhawk Air Museum is 
committed to safeguarding the stories of our veterans. Collaborating 
with the Library of Congress, their dedicated staff and approximately 
80 volunteers work with veterans to share their experiences, ensuring 
firsthand accounts of their service and sacrifice are recorded for 
future generations. To date, more than 1,300 veterans' stories have 
been preserved by the Warhawk's Veterans History Project.
  The Warhawk Air Museum serves not only as an educational resource for 
Idahoans, but also as the host of the largest monthly gathering of 
veterans in the State. Each month, the Kilroy Coffee Klatch brings 
together over 250 veterans, providing an opportunity for them to 
connect with others who may have served in the same branch of the 
military or conflict. This monthly event features a variety of 
speakers, many of whom are volunteers at the museum or regular 
attendees of the Coffee Klatch, covering a plethora of topics, such as 
serving in WWII or as a Dustoff helicopter pilot in Vietnam. Each month 
brings a new speaker and a new perspective on what it means to serve 
our great country.
  Under the leadership of executive director Carson Spear, the Warhawk 
Air Museum continues its mission ``to educate visitors about the cost 
of freedom and honor those who paid its price.'' The museum is 
developing a new hangar to honor those who served and sacrificed in the 
Global War on Terror. Once complete, the Warhawk will be one of the few 
museums in the country with an exhibit dedicated to this conflict.
  I am proud to have the Warhawk Air Museum in the great State of 
Idaho. It exemplifies the values that Idahoans hold dear, and I look 
forward to witnessing the continued impact this institution will have 
in our State and Nation.<bullet>

                      REMEMBERING TED DREWES, JR.

<bullet> Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 
life of Ted Drewes, Jr., of St. Louis, MO, who passed away on August 
28, 2024.
  For decades, Ted Drewes, Jr., was the face of the iconic frozen 
custard business established by his father and namesake. Ted took the 
family business to new heights, serving concretes, sundaes, and shakes 
to St. Louis locals and visitors at his stores on South Grand and 
Chippewa. For decades, Ted Drewes has sold approximately 150,000 
gallons of custard per year. Under his leadership, Ted Drewes Frozen 
Custard became an iconic St. Louis institution. He expanded the 
Chippewa location on Route 66 to accommodate more customers, and he 
started selling Christmas trees during winter in the parking lot.
  The name Ted Drewes is known across our country for delicious ice 
cream. For St. Louisans, however, it is much more than just an ice 
cream stand. Ted Drewes built a business where memories are made. 
Often, the lines of customers run down the block. Whether the lines are 
filled with Cardinals fans getting a treat on their way home from a 
game or young people wearing suits and dresses after a school dance, 
the crowds that flock to his business are a testament to the one-of-a-
kind gathering place he created.
  Ted Drewes is a St. Louis institution as much as the Cardinals or the 
Gateway Arch. After a long and fulfilling life, Ted leaves behind a 
loving family and generations of satisfied customers. His signature 
phrase--``It really is good, guys . . . and gals!''--as well as the 
great man who served generations of customers will be remembered in St. 
Louis for many years to come.<bullet>

             RECOGNIZING INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC SERVICES INC.

<bullet> Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month 
I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by 
highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho. 
Today, I am pleased to honor Innovative Electric Services, Inc., as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for October 2024.
  Innovative Electric Services, founded by Kelly and Mindy Watkins, 
opened in 2018 in Clearwater County. A family-owned and operated 
business, the Watkins were motivated to frame their company after 
personal experience with the lack of trade services available in rural 
areas. Their exceptional work ethic and integrity, coupled with their 
efforts to reach rural areas, have contributed to their success. Within 
a year, they were able to expand their team and move to a larger 
location. Kelly and Mindy credit their continued success to their 
exceptional team of 10 employees and the Watkins' three sons Kade, 
Ryan, and Jase, who are invaluable to the business. Their youngest son 
is carrying on the family legacy as he begins his second year as an 
electrical apprentice.
  Innovative Electric Services puts a high premium on engaging with 
local businesses and community circles. They are robust supporters of 
local sports, education, and 4-H programs. In addition to donations, 
they generously give materials and labor to community projects, 
including sporting facilities for the Orofino High School.
  Congratulations to the Watkins and all of the employees at Innovative 
Electric Services on their selection as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for October 2024. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business 
owners and entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look 
forward to your continued growth and success.<bullet>

                 RECOGNIZING THE EQUALITY HEALTH CENTER

<bullet> Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor the 
Equality Health Center, EHC, in Concord, NH, on its 50th anniversary. 
EHC is a nonprofit healthcare facility that has provided comprehensive 
sexual and reproductive care to people throughout New England for five 
decades. In addition to providing health care services, EHC is 
committed to advocacy, education, and outreach for their community. I 
join a grateful community in saluting EHC's staff for their client-
centered, inclusive, accessible, and empowering services.
  The inspiring story of the Equality Health Center begins in 1973 
after the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. Although the 
ruling affirmed a woman's right to make her own reproductive healthcare 
decisions, these services were often inaccessible and expensive, 
especially in New Hampshire. A group of feminists began meeting in 
Concord to address this inequity and started to envision a nonprofit 
clinic for safe, accessible, and affordable services. A year later in 
October of 1974, New Hampshire Women's Health Services opened its 
doors. In the decades since, the hard-working team at EHC has broadened 
its mission to include providing a wide range of sexual and 
reproductive care, as well as expanding the number of clients it serves 
to include the LGBTQ+ community. To reflect its commitment to inclusive 
services, New Hampshire Women's Health Services proudly changed its 
name in 2016 to Equality Health Center.
  EHC is a nationally recognized expert in abortion services and 
contraceptive care. It offers services that include

[[Page S6363]]

birth control and family planning, gender affirming and non-binary 
care, HIV testing and PrEP, STI testing and treatment, miscarriage 
management, behavioral health, and annual exams. It has received 
numerous awards from the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union, the 
National Women's Health Network, and NARAL-NH. EHC is dedicated to 
building a world where all people have the autonomy to make educated 
choices regarding their healthcare. It provides exceptional care to 
clients with an emphasis on equality, inclusivity, and self-
determination. It is also committed to training future healthcare 
professionals to provide quality and compassionate care.
  EHC is engrained within the Concord community and utilizes 
longstanding local partnerships to accomplish shared goals of 
reproductive freedom and social justice. For example, EHC has educated 
hundreds of individuals about reproductive and sexual health through 
its speaker services at schools and community events.
  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in congratulating the Equality Health Center on 
five decades of service and wishing them the best in their future 
endeavors.<bullet>

          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

  S. 5148. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow 
certain family caregivers to contribute to a Roth IRA; to the Committee 
on Finance.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Ms. COLLINS:
  S. 5149. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow 
additional catch-up contributions for certain family caregivers; to the 
Committee on Finance.
  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce two bills: 
the Improving Retirement Security for Family Caregiver Act and the 
Catching Up Family Caregivers Act. These bills, which I am introducing 
today with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, would enable 
family caregivers to better save for retirement.
  Family caregivers play an essential role in American society: caring 
for this Nation's children and elderly. While providing many vital 
services for their loved ones, these caregivers often suffer 
economically. According to a new study from the Edward Jones Grassroots 
Taskforce, 64 percent of women say their caregiving duties have 
negatively impacted their ability to save toward their long-term 
financial goals. In fact, an average 26-year-old female making $60,000 
a year leaving the workforce for 5 years to raise her children will 
lose close to $1 million over her lifetime due to lost retirement 
assets and wage growth. Those taking care of an aging parent often face 
similar experiences. While it is difficult to put a dollar amount to 
the value of the devotion, time, and services that these caregivers 
provide, the Alzheimer's Association has estimated that in 2023, family 
caregivers provided $350 billion in uncompensated long-term care.
  For this reason, the American retirement system needs to change to 
benefit family caregivers. Our legislation would enable family 
caregivers to contribute to their retirement funds without significant 
income. Currently, contributions are capped to Roth IRAs at $7,000 or 
yearly income, whichever is less; therefore a family caregiver earning 
less than $7,000 annually is severely limited in their ability to 
contribute to a retirement account. The Improving Retirement Security 
for Family Caregiver Act, would eliminate the income cap for family 
caregivers, enabling them to contribute to a Roth IRA through other 
savings accounts up to$7,000 annually.
  In addition, our current retirement system allows those over the age 
of 50 to contribute more money to their retirement than the statutory 
limit, the idea being that those in their fifties have more 
discretionary income than they did when they were younger to put 
towards retirement. Using the same logic, the Catching Up Family 
Caregivers Act would give family caregivers extra years of maximum 
catch-up contributions for every year they were sidelined from the 
workforce to be a family caregiver. These complementary bills would 
allow family caregivers to invest more in their retirement funds now 
and later.
  These complementary bills would allow family caregivers to invest 
more in their retirement funds now and later. They have earned to 
support of important stakeholder organizations that represent family 
caregivers, including the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's 
Impact Movement. In letters that support these bills, they write, 
``Nearly half of all caregivers who provide help to older adults do so 
for someone living with Alzheimer's or another dementia. Alzheimer's 
takes a devastating toll on caregivers.'' I am grateful for the support 
of these groups who know how important these retirement reforms will be 
to the financial security of caregivers who sacrifice for their loved 
ones. I urge my colleagues to support our legislation.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills 
be printed in the Record:
  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

      By Mrs. BRITT (for herself and Mr. Fetterman):
  S. 5150. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting 
through the Surgeon General, to implement a mental health warning label 
on social

[[Page S6372]]

media platforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation.
  Mrs. BRITT. Madam President, it is always an honor to represent my 
great State, to stand and speak in front of my colleagues and before 
the American people. But today is particularly special for me as my 
parents are here in the Gallery, and I rise today with great concerns 
for our country as a parent myself.
  As a mom of two, I know firsthand the struggles that parents face 
with raising their children. You add doing that in this digital age, 
and obstacles and challenges become that much more great.
  Our country is in the throes of a mental health crisis. And don't 
just take my word for it. Just look at the data. Twenty percent of 
Americans between the ages of 12 and 17 experienced at least one major 
depressive episode in 2021. When looking at just girls, that number 
then increases to 29 percent.
  This crisis--and crisis doesn't even really feel strong enough when 
we are talking about rates this high--is alarming, and recent 
developments show us that. But before that, let's rewind.
  Between the years of 2011 and 2019, depression rates amongst our 
teenagers more than doubled. The number of adolescents who reported 
experiencing a major depressive episode shot up 60 percent from 2007 to 
2019.
  Emergency room visits by children and teens for anxiety, mood 
disorders, and self-harm increased sharply during this time as well, 
and suicide rates among our children, between the ages of 10 and then 
all the way to 24, which had been stable the previous decade, jumped by 
almost 60 percent.
  When we talk about suicide, the numbers show an incredible heartbreak 
of what is actually occurring. Suicide is now the second leading cause 
of death for Americans under the age of 44. In 2021, 25 percent of 
teenage girls made a plan to die by suicide.
  The next year, in 2022, one-third of high school girls said that they 
seriously considered taking their own life, and then 9 percent of our 
high school population actually attempted death by suicide. That is 9 
out of every 100 high schoolers. This is not OK.
  Meanwhile, factors that contribute positively to mental health are on 
the decline. Data from surveys conducted by groups like the CDC Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance System and the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse show that teens and tweens today get less sleep, less exercise, 
and have less in-person contact than their peers before them.
  So in an age where we brag about being more ``connected'' than ever, 
we have actually never been further apart. And while we should always 
be wary of blaming just one culprit, there is one thing that stands out 
among the rest, and that is social media usage.
  Nearly 100 percent of teenagers have access to smartphones. I am 
looking at our incredible group of pages down in front, and my guess 
is, if I polled this group, we would see that that stat is probably 
true. Half, though, of American teenagers say that they are online 
constantly.
  I wish that the Gallery could see that I am actually getting some 
shaking heads up here.
  This is about the same percentage of teens who reported feeling 
addicted to their smartphones in 2016.
  Fifty-four percent of American teenagers admit that it would be 
really hard to give up their social media, and 35 percent of American 
teenagers say that they are on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, 
Facebook--I am sure I am missing a few, right?--almost constantly.
  TikTok, in particular, has presented some really serious concerns. So 
for those of you who may not be aware, just this spring, several 
American lawmakers received death threats from users saying they would 
kill us if we voted for the TikTok divestment bill.
  My office got one of those messages; so did Senator Tillis from North 
Carolina. I wouldn't be surprised, if we polled all 100 Senators, if 
there weren't messages like this on many, many more machines. And the 
truth is, it wasn't just about killing us. These messages also said 
that, if we did this, they would kill themselves and/or harm others.
  That came just after TikTok urged its users to call American 
lawmakers and stop them from voting for that bill. So, clearly, social 
media has a deep hold on our country's children and teens.
  U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote a few months ago that 
adolescents who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media double 
their risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who do not.
  But guess what the data shows. Our teenagers aren't on social media 
for 3 hours a day, on average. They are on social media around 5 hours 
a day.
  Many kids acknowledge that social media is bad for them, and many 
parents acknowledge that, too. But the situation is clearly getting 
more devastating. It seems to just be getting worse.
  Our kids are suffering, with many not realizing that the root cause 
is due to the addictive quality of social media, and they actually seem 
to feel powerless on how to end that.
  Earlier this summer, the Surgeon General called for the creation of a 
warning label on social media, and 42 out of 50 State attorneys 
general, including Alabama's own Steve Marshall and Pennsylvania's 
Michelle Henry, backed this proposal.
  Senator Fetterman and I are on the same page about this. There should 
be a warning label on social media, and that is why today we have 
introduced the Stop the Scroll Act. Our bill would require a social 
media platform to have a warning label to be placed on it to ensure 
that users know about the potential adverse effects of these apps and 
they must acknowledge that before proceeding to use them.
  While Senator Fetterman and I agree on the importance of these 
labels, we also recognize that we are not the experts here. Our bill 
would not determine what the label would say. Rather, we would leave 
that up to the Surgeon General.
  The only requirement that this bill would create is that the warning 
label include a way to quickly access mental health resources--which, 
in our mind, would look like a link to 9-8-8, the Suicide and Crisis 
Lifeline, or other resources--putting them quickly at the fingertips of 
those who need them most.
  Now, warning labels won't prevent the American people from using the 
app, just like warnings on tobacco or alcohol don't stop someone from 
purchasing them. The warning is a caution so that consumers have their 
eyes opened to the potential dangers ahead. It empowers them to make 
informed decisions.
  It is similar to when a doctor tells a patient they need to limit 
their sugar intake, right? The doctor isn't going to force you to stop 
eating sugar, but the warning from the doctor will likely make the 
patient think twice. In that situation, the doctor will usually provide 
advice on how to reduce sugar in your diet.
  That is what the warning does. It makes sure consumers' eyes are 
open. It ensures that they acknowledge it before moving forward, and it 
provides direction to access resources if that user needs help.
  The Stop the Scroll Act isn't a cure. It is a caution that will 
hopefully help promote healthier social media usage, while providing 
those in crisis with the resources they need to get help.
  It is an important step forward in creating a safer digital age for 
all Americans.
  So I am grateful for the leadership of my colleague from Pennsylvania 
Senator Fetterman in introducing this important legislation alongside 
me today. I want to thank Senator Fetterman and Surgeon General Murthy 
for their efforts to address the dangers of social media.
  I am committed to continuing to work in a bipartisan fashion to help 
our kids have the kind of childhood that we were blessed to enjoy and 
to ensure that they have access to the American dream, rather than the 
social media nightmares that so many families are dealing with today.

  S. 5149. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow

      By Mrs. BRITT (for herself and Mr. Fetterman):
  S. 5150. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting 
through the Surgeon General, to implement a mental health warning label 
on social

[[Page S6372]]

media platforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation.
  Mrs. BRITT. Madam President, it is always an honor to represent my 
great State, to stand and speak in front of my colleagues and before 
the American people. But today is particularly special for me as my 
parents are here in the Gallery, and I rise today with great concerns 
for our country as a parent myself.
  As a mom of two, I know firsthand the struggles that parents face 
with raising their children. You add doing that in this digital age, 
and obstacles and challenges become that much more great.
  Our country is in the throes of a mental health crisis. And don't 
just take my word for it. Just look at the data. Twenty percent of 
Americans between the ages of 12 and 17 experienced at least one major 
depressive episode in 2021. When looking at just girls, that number 
then increases to 29 percent.
  This crisis--and crisis doesn't even really feel strong enough when 
we are talking about rates this high--is alarming, and recent 
developments show us that. But before that, let's rewind.
  Between the years of 2011 and 2019, depression rates amongst our 
teenagers more than doubled. The number of adolescents who reported 
experiencing a major depressive episode shot up 60 percent from 2007 to 
2019.
  Emergency room visits by children and teens for anxiety, mood 
disorders, and self-harm increased sharply during this time as well, 
and suicide rates among our children, between the ages of 10 and then 
all the way to 24, which had been stable the previous decade, jumped by 
almost 60 percent.
  When we talk about suicide, the numbers show an incredible heartbreak 
of what is actually occurring. Suicide is now the second leading cause 
of death for Americans under the age of 44. In 2021, 25 percent of 
teenage girls made a plan to die by suicide.
  The next year, in 2022, one-third of high school girls said that they 
seriously considered taking their own life, and then 9 percent of our 
high school population actually attempted death by suicide. That is 9 
out of every 100 high schoolers. This is not OK.
  Meanwhile, factors that contribute positively to mental health are on 
the decline. Data from surveys conducted by groups like the CDC Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance System and the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse show that teens and tweens today get less sleep, less exercise, 
and have less in-person contact than their peers before them.
  So in an age where we brag about being more ``connected'' than ever, 
we have actually never been further apart. And while we should always 
be wary of blaming just one culprit, there is one thing that stands out 
among the rest, and that is social media usage.
  Nearly 100 percent of teenagers have access to smartphones. I am 
looking at our incredible group of pages down in front, and my guess 
is, if I polled this group, we would see that that stat is probably 
true. Half, though, of American teenagers say that they are online 
constantly.
  I wish that the Gallery could see that I am actually getting some 
shaking heads up here.
  This is about the same percentage of teens who reported feeling 
addicted to their smartphones in 2016.
  Fifty-four percent of American teenagers admit that it would be 
really hard to give up their social media, and 35 percent of American 
teenagers say that they are on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, 
Facebook--I am sure I am missing a few, right?--almost constantly.
  TikTok, in particular, has presented some really serious concerns. So 
for those of you who may not be aware, just this spring, several 
American lawmakers received death threats from users saying they would 
kill us if we voted for the TikTok divestment bill.
  My office got one of those messages; so did Senator Tillis from North 
Carolina. I wouldn't be surprised, if we polled all 100 Senators, if 
there weren't messages like this on many, many more machines. And the 
truth is, it wasn't just about killing us. These messages also said 
that, if we did this, they would kill themselves and/or harm others.
  That came just after TikTok urged its users to call American 
lawmakers and stop them from voting for that bill. So, clearly, social 
media has a deep hold on our country's children and teens.
  U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote a few months ago that 
adolescents who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media double 
their risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who do not.
  But guess what the data shows. Our teenagers aren't on social media 
for 3 hours a day, on average. They are on social media around 5 hours 
a day.
  Many kids acknowledge that social media is bad for them, and many 
parents acknowledge that, too. But the situation is clearly getting 
more devastating. It seems to just be getting worse.
  Our kids are suffering, with many not realizing that the root cause 
is due to the addictive quality of social media, and they actually seem 
to feel powerless on how to end that.
  Earlier this summer, the Surgeon General called for the creation of a 
warning label on social media, and 42 out of 50 State attorneys 
general, including Alabama's own Steve Marshall and Pennsylvania's 
Michelle Henry, backed this proposal.
  Senator Fetterman and I are on the same page about this. There should 
be a warning label on social media, and that is why today we have 
introduced the Stop the Scroll Act. Our bill would require a social 
media platform to have a warning label to be placed on it to ensure 
that users know about the potential adverse effects of these apps and 
they must acknowledge that before proceeding to use them.
  While Senator Fetterman and I agree on the importance of these 
labels, we also recognize that we are not the experts here. Our bill 
would not determine what the label would say. Rather, we would leave 
that up to the Surgeon General.
  The only requirement that this bill would create is that the warning 
label include a way to quickly access mental health resources--which, 
in our mind, would look like a link to 9-8-8, the Suicide and Crisis 
Lifeline, or other resources--putting them quickly at the fingertips of 
those who need them most.
  Now, warning labels won't prevent the American people from using the 
app, just like warnings on tobacco or alcohol don't stop someone from 
purchasing them. The warning is a caution so that consumers have their 
eyes opened to the potential dangers ahead. It empowers them to make 
informed decisions.
  It is similar to when a doctor tells a patient they need to limit 
their sugar intake, right? The doctor isn't going to force you to stop 
eating sugar, but the warning from the doctor will likely make the 
patient think twice. In that situation, the doctor will usually provide 
advice on how to reduce sugar in your diet.
  That is what the warning does. It makes sure consumers' eyes are 
open. It ensures that they acknowledge it before moving forward, and it 
provides direction to access resources if that user needs help.
  The Stop the Scroll Act isn't a cure. It is a caution that will 
hopefully help promote healthier social media usage, while providing 
those in crisis with the resources they need to get help.
  It is an important step forward in creating a safer digital age for 
all Americans.
  So I am grateful for the leadership of my colleague from Pennsylvania 
Senator Fetterman in introducing this important legislation alongside 
me today. I want to thank Senator Fetterman and Surgeon General Murthy 
for their efforts to address the dangers of social media.
  I am committed to continuing to work in a bipartisan fashion to help 
our kids have the kind of childhood that we were blessed to enjoy and 
to ensure that they have access to the American dream, rather than the 
social media nightmares that so many families are dealing with today.

  SEPTEMBER 23, 2024, TO SEPTEMBER 29, 2024, AS ``ASIAN AMERICAN AND 
      NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER-SERVING INSTITUTIONS WEEK''

                              S. Res. 845

       Whereas the Asian American and Native American Pacific 
     Islander-Serving Institutions Program was originally 
     authorized on September 27, 2007, by the College Cost 
     Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-84; 121 
     Stat. 784);
       Whereas 2024 marks the 17th anniversary of the 
     establishment of Asian American and Native American Pacific 
     Islander-serving institutions by Congress;

     Islander-serving institutions are degree-granting 
     postsecondary institutions that have an undergraduate 
     enrollment of not less than 10 percent Asian American, Native 
     Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students;
       Whereas the purpose of the Asian American and Native 
     American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions Program is to 
     improve the availability and quality of postsecondary 
     education programs to serve Asian American, Native Hawaiian, 
     and Pacific Islander students;
       Whereas, since 2007, over 270 colleges and universities 
     have been eligible as Asian American and Native American 
     Pacific Islander-serving institutions throughout the United 
     States, including the United States territories in the 
     Pacific;
       Whereas there are 207 funded and eligible Asian American 
     and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions 
     operating in the United States, including the United States 
     territories in the Pacific;
       Whereas, as of the 2023-2024 academic year, 69 Asian 
     American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving 
     institutions are or have been funded in the United States, 
     including the United States territories in the Pacific;
       Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific 
     Islander-serving institutions are of critical importance, as 
     they enroll, support, and graduate large proportions of Asian 
     American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander college 
     students, the majority of whom are overwhelmingly from 
     families with low incomes and are first-generation college 
     students;
       Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific 
     Islander-serving institutions comprise only 6.9 percent of 
     all institutions of higher education, yet enroll 46 percent 
     of all Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
     undergraduate students in the United States, including the 
     United States territories in the Pacific;

     Islander-serving institutions employ many of the Asian 
     American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander faculty,

       Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific 
     Islander-serving institutions create culturally relevant 
     academic and cocurricular programs, research, and services, 
     which increase retention, transfer, and graduation rates 
     while also enhancing the overall educational experiences of 
     Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
     students;

       (3) recognizes the 17th anniversary of the establishment of 
     Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving 
     institutions and expresses support for the designation of

     Institutions Week''; and
       (4) calls on the people of the United States, including the 
     United States territories in the Pacific, and interested 
     groups to observe ``Asian American and Native American 
     Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions Week'' with appropriate 
     activities, ceremonies, and programs to demonstrate support 
     for Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-
     serving institutions.

   SENATE RESOLUTION 846--COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
            ERADICATION OF WILD POLIOVIRUS FROM THE AMERICAS

  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Reed, Ms. Sinema, Ms. 
Klobuchar, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Van Hollen, Mrs. Murray, Mr. 
Welch, and Mr. Booker) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:

                              S. Res. 846

       Whereas nearly 60,000 children in the United States were 
     reported to have polio in 1952 alone, with more than 20,000 
     cases of paralysis;
       Whereas, thanks to vaccination, polio was eliminated from 
     the United States in 1979;
       Whereas the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a 
     unique public-private partnership that includes the Federal 
     Government, Rotary International, the World Health 
     Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund 
     (commonly known as ``UNICEF''), the Bill and Melinda Gates 
     Foundation, and GAVI, was established in 1988 with a goal of 
     eradicating polio globally, at a time when there were more 
     than 350,000 cases of polio recorded annually;
       Whereas Rotary International, a global association founded 
     in Illinois, has contributed more than $2,700,000,000 and 
     volunteered countless hours in the global fight against polio 
     since 1979;
       Whereas, since the goal of global polio eradication was set 
     in 1988, incidences of polio have been reduced by more than 
     99.9 percent through the use of the inactivated polio vaccine 
     developed by Jonas Salk and the oral polio vaccine developed 
     by Albert Sabin;
       Whereas the Americas were the first region to be certified 
     free from wild poliovirus by the WHO in 1994, with the last 
     case of wild poliovirus in the Americas confirmed in Peru in 
     1991;
       Whereas, since 1994, 4 other regions of the world have been 
     certified free from wild poliovirus and 2 of the 3 strains of 
     wild poliovirus have been certified eradicated worldwide;
       Whereas, as of September 2024, only Afghanistan and 
     Pakistan have been unable to fully stop transmission of wild 
     poliovirus, a decrease from more than 125 countries in 1988;
       Whereas the GPEI reaches the world's most vulnerable 
     children, including those who have been displaced, living in 
     areas of insecurity or conflict, where cases of variant 
     poliovirus remain of concern;
       Whereas, as of September 2024, according to the Centers for 
     Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 20,000,000 
     people are walking who have been spared from paralysis and 
     1,500,000 deaths have been averted worldwide thanks to the 
     efforts of the GPEI;
       Whereas, in addition to combating polio, the global 
     workforce and infrastructure of the GPEI has frequently 
     served as first responders for natural disasters and other 
     public health crises, including outbreaks of Ebola and the 
     COVID-19 pandemic;
       Whereas, when polio is eradicated, it will be only the 
     second human disease in history to make such an achievement, 
     the first being smallpox;
       Whereas progress toward global polio eradication is a 
     testament to what can be achieved through sustained global 
     commitment and collaboration; and
       Whereas, as long as poliovirus circulates anywhere, it 
     remains a threat to children everywhere: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) commemorates the 30th anniversary of the Americas being 
     certified polio-free by the World Health Organization on 
     September 29, 1994;
       (2) commends the work of the Pan American Health 
     Organization (PAHO) and its member states on keeping the 
     Americas wild poliovirus free;
       (3) supports the goals and ideals of the Global Polio 
     Eradication Initiative;
       (4) encourages and supports the international community of 
     governments and nongovernmental organizations in remaining 
     committed to the eradication of polio; and
       (5) encourages the Federal Government to continue 
     committing funding to the Global Polio Eradication 
     Initiative.

  SENATE RESOLUTION 848--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 23 THROUGH

following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 848

       Whereas hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act 
     committed by a person, whether individually or in concert 
     with other persons, against a student regardless of the 
     willingness of that student to participate, in connection 
     with membership in an organization, and causes or is likely 
     to contribute to a substantial risk above the reasonable risk 
     encountered in the course of participation in the institution 
     of higher education or the organization (such as the physical 
     training necessary for participation on an athletic team), of 
     physical injury, mental harm, or personal degradation;
       Whereas 55 percent of college students involved in 
     extracurricular clubs, athletic teams, and organizations 
     reported experiencing hazing;

     expectations for safe campus communities where healthy group 
     behaviors, ethical leadership, and feelings of positive well-
     being and belonging are fostered;
       Whereas it is recommended that hazing prevention education 
     is broad and includes students, campus staff, administrators, 
     faculty, alumni, and beyond;
       Whereas hundreds of students have died as a result of 
     collegiate hazing, including Kristin High on September 9,

     SENATE RESOLUTION 847--HONORING WADEE ALFAYOUMI, A 6-YEAR-OLD 
PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN BOY, MURDERED AS A VICTIM OF A HATE CRIME FOR HIS 
         PALESTINIAN-MUSLIM IDENTITY, IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. 
Murray, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Welch, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Sanders, and Ms. 
Cantwell) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to:

                              S. Res. 847

       Whereas Wadee Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old Palestinian-Muslim-
     American boy, was loved by his family and friends as an 
     energetic, loving, and joyous light who brought sunshine to 
     his loved ones and classmates;
       Whereas, on October 14, 2023, at 11:30 a.m., Wadee 
     Alfayoumi was brutally stabbed 26 times by a hate-driven 
     perpetrator and tragically succumbed to his injuries;
       Whereas Wadee Alfayoumi's perpetrator has been indicted for 
     a hate crime by the Will County, Illinois, grand jury, and 
     the Department of Justice has opened a hate crimes 
     investigation into the events leading to Wadee Alfayoumi's 
     death, as there is evidence the perpetrator yelled during the 
     brutal killing, ``All Muslims must die and your people must 
     die'' and has been observed to be a consumer of media 
     containing dehumanizing and hateful rhetoric that is anti-
     Muslim and anti-Palestinian;
       Whereas Wadee Alfayoumi was born and raised in the United 
     States, and his family wanted the United States to provide 
     them a life of safety away from dehumanizing and hateful 
     rhetoric toward Palestinian people;
       Whereas no one should be a target of hate because of their 
     ethnicity or religion, whether such ethnicity or religion is 
     expressed verbally or through how one dresses, such as 
     through the wearing of a hijab, keffiyeh, turban, mitpahat, 
     tichel, shpitzel, sheitel, kippah, or yarmulke;
       Whereas dehumanizing rhetoric can fuel sentiments of hate 
     that result in violence against those who belong or who are 
     perceived to belong to a certain ethnic or religious group;
       Whereas the Palestinian community's migration to the United 
     States dates back to the late 19th century;
       Whereas the United States is home to one of the largest 
     Palestinian diasporas in the world that is made up of 
     lawyers, doctors, teachers, business owners, law enforcement, 
     and others, all who contribute to the history, arts, 
     commerce, promise, and character of the United States;
       Whereas Wadee Alfayoumi shared a heritage, history, love, 
     culture, tradition, and brilliance belonging to the 
     Palestinian people and was a symbol of another great 
     Palestinian life full of promise;
       Whereas Palestinian children, Israeli children, children in 
     the United States, and those all across the globe deserve to 
     live in peace and be free from discrimination, hate crimes, 
     and violence; and
       Whereas the recent Israel-Gaza conflict has had a 
     particularly devastating impact on children in the region, 
     including at one point resulting in a Palestinian child dying 
     every 10 minutes, according to the World Health Organization: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes that--
       (1) the United States lost the beautiful light of Wadee 
     Alfayoumi because of hate;
       (2) it is the duty of elected officials and media to tell 
     the truth without dehumanizing rhetoric when informing the 
     public of factual information;
       (3) freedom of speech and peaceful protest are 
     constitutionally protected and a fundamental cornerstone of 
     democracy; and
       (4) the United States has zero tolerance for hate crimes, 
     Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-Palestinian and anti-
     Arab discrimination.

  SENATE RESOLUTION 849--CALLING ON CONGRESS, SCHOOLS, AND STATE AND 
  LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL 
   IMPLICATIONS OF DYSLEXIA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED, AND DESIGNATING 
         OCTOBER 2024 AS ``NATIONAL DYSLEXIA AWARENESS MONTH''

  Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mr. Hickenlooper, Mrs. Capito, Ms. Warren, 
Mr. Boozman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. King) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 849

       Whereas dyslexia is--
       (1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an 
     individual who has the intelligence to be a much better 
     reader; and
       (2) most commonly caused by a difficulty in phonological 
     processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of 
     spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual 
     to speak, read, spell, and, often, the ability to learn a 
     second language;
       Whereas the First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-391; 132 
     Stat. 5194 et seq.) included a definition of dyslexia as part 
     of the requirement of the Act to screen inmates for dyslexia 
     upon intake in Federal prisons;
       Whereas the definition of dyslexia in section 3635 of title 
     18, United States Code, as added by section 101(a) of the 
     First Step Act of 2018, is the first and only definition of 
     dyslexia in a Federal statute;
       Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and 
     affects 80 to 90 percent of all individuals with a learning 
     disability;
       Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly prevalent, 
     affecting as many as 1 out of every 5 individuals;
       Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an individual with 
     dyslexia may have both--
       (1) weaknesses in decoding that result in difficulties with 
     accurate or fluent word recognition; and
       (2) strengths in higher-level cognitive functions, such as 
     reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, and problem 
     solving;
       Whereas great progress has been made in understanding 
     dyslexia on a scientific level, including the 
     epidemiological, cognitive, and neurobiological bases of 
     dyslexia;
       Whereas the achievement gap between typical readers and 
     dyslexic readers occurs as early as first grade; and
       Whereas early screening for, and early diagnosis of, 
     dyslexia are critical for ensuring that individuals with 
     dyslexia receive focused, evidence-based intervention that 
     leads to fluent reading, the promotion of self-awareness and 
     self-empowerment, and the provision of necessary 
     accommodations that ensure success in school and in life: 
     Now, therefore, be it

[[Page S6375]]

       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) calls on Congress, schools, and State and local 
     educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has 
     significant educational implications that must be addressed; 
     and
       (2) designates October 2024 as ``National Dyslexia 
     Awareness Month''.

     contributing to the food security of the United States by 
     providing a sustainable and healthy meat source;
       Whereas a bison has been depicted on the official seal of 
     the Department of the Interior since 1912;

       Whereas several sports teams and businesses have the bison 
     as a mascot, which highlights the iconic and cultural

       Whereas Indigenous communities and a group of ranchers 
     helped save bison from extinction in the late 1800s by 
     gathering the remaining bison of the diminished herds;
       Whereas, on December 8, 1905, William Hornaday, Theodore 
     Roosevelt, and others formed the American Bison Society in 
     response to the near extinction of bison in the United 
     States;
       Whereas, on October 11, 1907, the American Bison Society 
     sent 15 captive-bred bison from the New York Zoological Park, 
     now known as the ``Bronx Zoo'', to the first big game refuge 
     in the United States, now known as the ``Wichita Mountains 
     Wildlife Refuge'';
       Whereas, in 2005, the American Bison Society was 
     reestablished, bringing together bison ranchers, Native 
     American leaders and bison herd managers, Federal and State 
     agencies, conservation organizations, artists and writers, 
     young people, and natural and social scientists from the 
     United States, Canada, and Mexico to create a vision for the 
     North American bison in the 21st century;
       Whereas there are bison herds in national wildlife refuges, 
     national parks, and national forests, and on other Federal 
     land;
       Whereas there are bison in State-managed herds across 11 
     States;
       Whereas private, public, and Tribal bison leaders are

  SENATE RESOLUTION 852--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 20, 2024, AS ``NATIONAL 
                EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY AWARENESS DAY''

  Mr. MANCHIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Capito, and Mr. King) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 852

       Whereas many children from families with low incomes begin 
     school already far behind children from families with higher 
     incomes;
       Whereas research shows that children from families with low 
     incomes are less likely to have interactions that are 
     critical for language development, including--
       (1) being read to or spoken to regularly;
       (2) having access to books;
       (3) having a literacy-rich environment; and
       (4) accessing high-quality early childhood education 
     programs;
       Whereas language development is an important precursor to 
     literacy;
       Whereas access to high-quality early childhood education 
     programs can support early childhood language development and 
     literacy;
       Whereas, as early as 3 years of age, the vocabulary of a 
     child can predict the future third-grade reading proficiency 
     of the child;
       Whereas, during the first 3 years of life, children from 
     families with low-incomes can hear as many as 30,000,000 
     fewer words than children from more affluent families;
       Whereas, in 2022, the National Assessment of Educational 
     Progress (referred to in this preamble as ``NAEP'') reported 
     that--
       (1) 66 percent of fourth-grade public school students 
     nationally performed below the NAEP proficient level in 
     reading; and
       (2) 37 percent of fourth-grade public school students 
     nationally performed below the NAEP basic level in reading; 
     and
       Whereas awareness of early childhood literacy issues must 
     be heightened to encourage greater support to help children 
     achieve reading proficiency: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates October 20, 2024, as ``National Early 
     Childhood Literacy Awareness Day'';
       (2) encourages States, localities, schools, early childhood 
     education programs, and nonprofit organizations to observe 
     the day with appropriate programs and activities, with the 
     goal of increasing public awareness about early childhood 
     literacy issues;
       (3) recognizes the need to make early childhood literacy a 
     public priority;
       (4) supports the efforts of businesses, State and local 
     governments, early childhood education programs, nonprofit 
     organizations, educators, and volunteers dedicated to 
     increasing childhood literacy rates;

     governments, early childhood education programs, nonprofit 
     organizations, educators, and volunteers that--

[[Page S6376]]

     literacy issues, the causes of poor reading scores, and 
     potential solutions to those issues; and
       (B) work to promote the love of reading among children; and
       (6) encourages parents, other family members, and 
     caregivers to introduce children to the world of books and 
     other literacy activities in different ways, including by--
       (A) reading to children;
       (B) telling stories;

     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate 
     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from 
     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; 
     and
       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or 
     in the possession of the Senate may promote the 
     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action 
     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That Daniel Schwager, a former employee of the 
     Office of the Secretary of the Senate, is authorized to

     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no 
     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate 
     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from 
     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; 
     and
       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or 
     in the possession of the Senate may promote the 
     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action 
     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That Daniel Schwager, a former employee of the 
     Office of the Secretary of the Senate, is authorized to 
     provide relevant testimony in the case of United States v. 
     Kelley, except concerning matters for which a privilege 
     should be asserted.
       Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to 
     represent Mr. Schwager, and any current or former officer or 
     employee of the Secretary's office, in connection with the 
     production of evidence authorized in section one of this 
     resolution.

resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

       Whereas service dogs assist individuals with a wide range 
     of challenges;

     provide numerous health and fitness benefits;
       Whereas tens of thousands of service dogs are estimated to 
     be working in the United States today; and
       Whereas National Service Dog Day is an appropriate tribute

  SA 3295. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. Hagerty) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 91, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to 60 diplomats, in 
recognition of their bravery and heroism during the Holocaust; as 
follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Forgotten Heroes of the 
     Holocaust Congressional Gold Medal Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The following diplomats will be honored posthumously: 
     Per Anger (Sweden), Jose Maria Barreto Bustios (Peru), Lars 
     Berg (Sweden), Philippe Bernardini (Vatican/Italy), Hiram 
     (Harry) Bingham IV (United States), Friedrich Born 
     (Switzerland), Gilberto Bosques Saldivar (Mexico), Carlos de 
     Liz-Texeira Branquinho (Portugal), Samuel del Campo (Chile), 
     Aracy de Carvalho Guimaraes Rosa (Brazil), Jose Arturo

     Ferdinand Duckwitz (Germany), Harald Feller (Switzerland),

     Friedrich (Switzerland), Carlos Almeida Afonseca de Sampaio 
     Garrido (Portugal), Raymond Herman Geist (United States),

     (Romania), Alexander Kasser (Sandor Kasza) (Sweden), Elow 
     Kihlgren (Sweden), Joseph Willem (Joop) Kolkman 
     (Netherlands), Julius Kuhl (Poland), Aleksander 4ados 
     (Poland), Valdemar Langlet (Sweden), Charles (Carl) Lutz 
     (Switzerland), George Mandel-Mantello (El Salvador), Florian 
     Manoliu (Romania), Manuel Antonio Munoz Borrero (Ecuador), 
     Salomon Jacob (Sally) Noach (Netherlands), Giorgio (Jorge) 
     Perlasca (Spain/Italy), Ernst Prodolliet (Switzerland), 
     Eduardo Propper de Callejon (Spain), Franjo Puncuch 
     (Yugoslavia/Slovenia), Konstanty Rokicki (Poland), Sebastian 
     de Romero Radigales (Spain), Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli 
     (Vatican/Italy), Angelo Rotta (Vatican/Italy), Albert Emile 
     Routier (Turkey/France), Jose Ruiz Santaella (Spain), Stefan 
     Ryniewicz (Poland), Angel Sanz-Briz (Spain), Abdol-Hossein 
     Sardari (Iran), Henryk Slawik (Poland), Robert Smallbones 
     (United Kingdom), Aristides de Sousa Mendes (Portugal), Jan 
     Spisiak (Slovakia), Chiune (Sempo) Sugihara (Japan), 
     Ireanaeus Typaldos (Spain), Alexander (Sandor) Ujvary 
     (Vatican/Hungary), Selahattin Ulkumen (Turkey), Gennaro 
     Verolino (Vatican/Italy), Vladimir Vochoc (Czech Republic), 
     Ernst Vonrufs (Switzerland), Raoul Wallenberg (Sweden), 
     Guelfo Zamboni (Italy), Peter Zurcher (Switzerland), and Jan 
     Zwartendijk (Netherlands).
       (2) On September 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis began 
     their invasion of Europe, which started World War II and 
     threw the world into chaos. The Nazi plan of mass murder of 
     the Jewish population was in full motion. As battles were 
     being fought between countries, Jews were being rounded up 
     and sent to concentration camps throughout Europe. This 
     process began a mass exodus of people out of Europe, 
     especially those in the Jewish community.
       (3) During the war, members of the Jewish community used 
     every tool and means at their disposal to flee Nazi tyranny. 
     Thousands tried to flee on trains or boats to escape from 
     Europe.
       (4) While the armies of countries were fighting each other, 
     a handful of diplomats, from around the world, stepped 
     forward and took heroic actions to save Jews fleeing Europe. 
     This was an incredibly dangerous process. If the Nazis 
     discovered the actions of these diplomats they would be 
     expelled, as a few of them were. Also, while worrying about 
     the Nazis, diplomats had to worry about their careers and 
     livelihoods back home. Many of them had strict orders from 
     their home countries to not aid the Jewish population in any 
     way.
       (5) These diplomats used every means at their disposal to 
     help Jews fleeing persecution. One of the most powerful tools 
     the diplomats had to use was the issuing of passports and 
     travel visas contrary to the instruction of the governments 
     of the diplomats. This process alone is responsible for 
     saving hundreds of thousands of Jewish families in Europe. 
     This was not the only tool used as many of the diplomats were 
     connected with the local populations and were great 
     communicators for Jews trying to travel underground. They 
     were able set up safehouses and getaways to hide Jews and 
     especially Jewish children from Nazi authorities. In the most 
     dangerous of times, several of these diplomats confronted the 
     Nazis directly on behalf of the Jews and personally put 
     themselves in grave danger.
       (6) Every diplomat knew the dangers and knew what they were 
     up against, and still pushed forward to save those in the 
     most danger.
       (7) The Congressional Gold Medal authorized under this Act 
     will help remind humanity that when the diplomats were faced 
     with terrible crises, they went beyond the fold, including 
     risking their careers and the lives of themselves and their 
     families, to engage in this humanitarian mission. The 
     diplomats of today and future generations can look towards 
     these heroes and be inspired by their lives of heroism and 
     sacrifice.
       (8) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as stating or 
     implying that this group of honorees encompasses everyone who 
     took this type of heroic action during this era. As the title 
     attests, the ``Forgotten Heroes'' performed these deeds out 
     of righteousness, with no expectation of public acclaim. The 
     sponsors of this Act wish to honor this group of individuals 
     for whose deeds the historical record is currently definitive 
     and well-documented. Given that historical research is 
     ongoing, in the event that robust documentation from 
     professional historians, expert stakeholders, and public 
     input identify others worthy of official recognition, future 
     Congresses retain the right to recognize additional forgotten 
     heroes of the Holocaust pursuant to future legislation.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate 
     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on 
     behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate 
     design in honor of the 60 diplomats identified in section 
     2(1), in recognition of their brave and vital service of 
     saving Jews during World War II.
       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation 
     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury 
     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a 
     single gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and 
     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.
       (c) Presentation of Medal.--The single gold medal presented

                                 ______
                                 
  SA 3296. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. Tester) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 815, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the female 
telephone operators of the Army Signal Corps, known as the ``Hello 
Girls''; as follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Hello Girls Congressional 
     Gold Medal Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war 
     against Germany. As a historically neutral nation, the United 
     States was unprepared to fight a technologically modern 
     conflict overseas. The United States called upon American 
     Telephone and Telegraph (referred to in this section as 
     ``AT&T'') to provide equipment and trained personnel for the 
     Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T executives in Army uniform 
     served at home under the provisions of the Act entitled ``An 
     Act for making further and more effectual provision for the 
     national defense, and for other purposes.'', approved June 3, 
     1916 (referred to in this section as the ``National Defense 
     Act of 1916''), which allowed for the induction of 
     individuals with specialized skills into a reserve force.
       (2) When General John Pershing sailed for Europe in May of 
     1917 as head of the American Expeditionary Forces (referred 
     to in this section as the ``AEF''), he took telephone 
     operating equipment with him in recognition of the inadequacy 
     of European circuitry and with the understanding that 
     telephones would play a key role in battlefield 
     communications for the first time in the history of war.
       (3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF struggled to 
     develop the telephone service necessary for the Army to 
     function under battlefield conditions. Monolingual 
     infantrymen from the United States were unable to connect 
     calls rapidly or communicate effectively with their French 
     counterparts to put calls through over toll lines that linked 
     one region of the country with another. The Army found that 
     the average male operator required 60 seconds to make a 
     connection. That rate was unacceptably slow, especially for 
     operational calls between command outposts and the front 
     lines.
       (4) During this time, in the United States, telephone 
     operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired for their speed 
     in connecting calls, women filled 85 percent of the telephone 
     operating positions in the United States. It took the average 
     female operator 10 seconds to make a connection.
       (5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing cabled the War 
     Department and wrote, ``On account of the great difficulty of 
     obtaining properly qualified men, request organization and 
     dispatch to France a force of women telephone operators all 
     speaking French and English equally well.''. To begin, 
     General Pershing requested 100 women under the command of a 
     commissioned captain, writing that ``All should have 
     allowances of Army nurses and should be uniformed.''.
       (6) The War Department sent press releases to newspapers 
     across the United States to recruit women willing to serve 
     for the duration of the war and face the hazards of submarine 
     warfare and aerial bombardment. These articles emphasized 
     that patriotic women would be ``full-fledged soldier[s] under 
     the articles of war'' and would ``do as much to help win the 
     war as the men in khaki who go `over the top.' ''. All women 
     selected would take the Army oath.
       (7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 100 positions 
     described in paragraph (5), and the first recruits took the 
     Army oath on January 15, 1918.
       (8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female Signal 
     Corps members had relative rather than traditional ranks and 
     were ranked as Operator, Supervisor, or Chief Operator. When 
     promoted, the women were required to swear the Army oath 
     again.
       (9) Telephone operators were the first women to serve as 
     soldiers in non-medical classifications, and the job of the 
     operators was to help win the war, not to mitigate the harms 
     of the war. In popular parlance, they were known as the 
     ``Hello Girls''.
       (10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uniforms and Army 
     insignia always, as well as standard-issue identity disks in 
     case of death, and were subject to court martial for 
     infractions of the military code.
       (11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and their immediate 
     officers, the legal counsel of the Army ruled internally on 
     March 20, 1918, that the women were not actually soldiers but 
     contract employees, even though the women had not seen or 
     signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for the 
     induction of men, and the code remained unchanged despite the 
     orders of General Pershing. Nevertheless, legal counsel also 
     recognized that the National Defense Act of 1916, which 
     allowed for the induction of members of the telephone 
     industry of the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed 
     no gender restrictions.
       (12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the first 
     contingent of operators began their official duties in 
     France. The operators arrived before most infantrymen of the 
     Armed Forces in order to facilitate logistics and deployment 
     and spent their first night in Paris under German 
     bombardment.
       (13) After the arrival of the operators, telephone service 
     in France improved immediately, as calls tripled from 13,000 
     to 36,000 per day.
       (14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and deployed 5 
     additional contingents of female Signal Corps operators. With 
     these personnel, the number of calls increased to 150,000 per 
     day.
       (15) In addition to standard telephone operating, bilingual 
     Signal Corps members provided simultaneous translation 
     between officers from France and officers from the United 
     States, who were communicating by telephone.
       (16) The AEF fought their first major battles in the last 2 
     months of the war. By that point, the Signal Corps considered 
     the contributions of women to be so essential that, in 
     telephone exchanges closest to the front line, the Army 
     exclusively used women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the 
     rear, the Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave 
     male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone traffic was 
     slower.
       (17) Seven bilingual operators--
       (A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne 
     under the immediate command of General Pershing;
       (B) staffed the Operations Boards through which orders to 
     advance, fire, and retreat were delivered to soldiers in the 
     trenches, to artillery units on alert, and to pilots awaiting 
     orders at French airfields; and
       (C) were awarded a ``Defensive Sector Clasp'' for the 
     Meuse-Argonne operation.
       (18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello Girls, Grace 
     Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was awarded the Distinguished 
     Service Medal. Out of 16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, 
     Banker was one of only 18 individuals so honored.
       (19) Thirty additional operators received special 
     commendations, many signed by General Pershing himself, for 
     ``exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous services'' in 
     ``Advance Sections'' of the conflict.
       (20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As of that date, 
     223 female operators served in France and had connected 
     26,000,000 calls for the AEF.
       (21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Signal Corps 
     wrote in his official report 2 days after the date on which 
     the war ended that ``a large part of the success of the 
     communications of this Army is due to . . . a competent staff 
     of women operators.''.
       (22) After the war ended, some women were ordered to 
     Coblenz in Germany for the occupation of that country and to 
     Paris for the Paris Peace Treaty of 1919 to continue 
     telephone operations, sometimes in direct support of 
     President Woodrow Wilson.
       (23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez Crittenden, 
     died in France in the service of the United States and were 
     buried there in military cemeteries with military ceremonies. 
     Those operators died of the same influenza pandemic that 
     killed more soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat 
     operations.
       (24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were ineligible for 
     discharge until formal release. Because of their role in 
     logistics, those women were among the last soldiers to come 
     home to the United States. The last Signal Corps operators 
     returned from France in January of 1920.
       (25) Upon arrival in the United States, the Army informed 
     female veterans that they had performed as civilians, not 
     soldiers, even though operators had served in Army uniform in 
     a theater of war surrounded by men who were similarly 
     engaged.
       (26) Despite the objections of General George Squier, the 
     top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, the Army denied 
     Signal Corps women the veterans' benefits granted to male 
     soldiers and female nurses, such as--
       (A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred in the line 
     of duty;

[[Page S6379]]

       (B) cash bonuses;
       (C) soldiers' pensions;
       (D) flags on their coffins; and
       (E) the Victory Medals promised them in France.
       (27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led by Merle 
     Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress more than 50 times for 
     their recognition. In 1977, under the sponsorship of Senator 
     Barry Goldwater, Congress passed legislation to retroactively 
     acknowledge the military service of the Women's Airforce 
     Service Pilots (referred to in this section as ``WASPs'') of 
     World War II and ``the service of any person in any other 
     similarly situated group the members of which rendered 
     service to the Armed Forces of the United States in a 
     capacity considered civilian employment or contractual 
     service at the time such service was rendered''.
       (28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed 
     the legislation described in paragraph (27) into law as the 
     GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 91 Stat. 
     1433).
       (29) The Signal Corps telephone operators applied for, and 
     were granted, status as veterans in 1979.
       (30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned home after 
     the war were still alive to receive their Victory Medals and 
     official discharge papers, which were finally awarded in 
     1979.
       (31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Massachusetts, 
     returned to the United States after the war, where she worked 
     on the professional staff of Congresswoman Edith Nourse 
     Rogers. Shaw lived to receive her honorable discharge and was 
     the first burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery 
     opened on October 11, 1980. Shaw's uniform is on display at 
     the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, 
     Missouri.
       (32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at a ceremony 
     in her home in Marine City, Michigan, ``Hello Girl'' Oleda 
     Joure Christides raised the paper to her lips and kissed it. 
     The only thing Christides ever wanted from the Federal 
     Government was a flag on her coffin.
       (33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into 
     law Public Law 111-40 (123 Stat. 1958), which awarded the 
     WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal for their service to the 
     United States.
       (34) For their role as pioneers who paved the way for all 
     women in uniform, and for service that was essential to 
     victory in World War I, the ``Hello Girls'' merit similar 
     recognition.

  SA 3297. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. McConnell) proposed an amendment to the 
bill H.R. 6513, to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to confirm 
the requirement that States allow access to designated congressional 
election observers to observe the election administration procedures in 
congressional elections; as follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Confirmation Of 
     Congressional Observer Access Act of 2024'' or the ``COCOA 
     Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       (a) Access Required.--Title III of the Help America Vote 
     Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amended--
       (1) by redesignating section 304 and 305 as sections 305 
     and 306; and
       (2) by inserting after section 303 the following new 
     section:

     ``SEC. 304. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       ``(a) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds 
     that, regardless of legislative action, it has the authority 
     to send congressional election observers to observe polling 
     locations, any location where processing, scanning, 
     tabulating, canvassing, recounting, auditing, or certifying 
     voting results is occurring, or any other part of the process 
     associated with elections for Federal office under the 
     authorities granted under article 1, section 5, clause 1 and 
     article 1, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution of the 
     United States. Procedures described herein do not establish 
     any new authorities or procedures with respect to Congress' 
     constitutional authority to observe congressional elections 
     but are provided simply to permit a convenient statutory 
     reference for existing congressional authority and activity.
       ``(b) Requiring States To Provide Access for Observers.--
       ``(1) Requirement.--A State shall provide each individual 
     who is acting as a designated congressional election observer 
     for an election for Federal office with full access to 
     clearly observe all elements of election administration 
     procedures, including, but not limited to, access to any area 
     in which a ballot is cast, processed, scanned, tabulated, 
     canvassed, recounted, audited, or certified, including during 
     pre- and post-election procedures.
       ``(2) Restrictions on activities of observers.--No 
     designated congressional election observer may handle a 
     ballot or election equipment (whether voting or nonvoting or 
     whether tabulating or nontabulating), advocate for any 
     position or candidate, take any action to reduce ballot 
     secrecy or voter privacy, take any action to interfere with 
     the ability of a voter to cast a ballot or an election 
     administrator to carry the administrator's duties, or 
     otherwise interfere with the election administration process.
       ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
     prohibit a designated congressional election observer from 
     asking questions of an election administrator, election 
     official, or election worker, or any other State or local 
     official.
       ``(c) Conduct of Observers.--
       ``(1) Removal.--
       ``(A) Authorization removal by election official.--If a 
     State or local election official has a reasonable basis to 
     believe that a designated congressional election observer has 
     engaged in or imminently will engage in intimidation or 
     deceptive practices prohibited by Federal law, or in the 
     disruption of voting, processing, scanning, tabulating, 
     canvassing, or recounting of ballots, or the certification of 
     results, a State or local election official may remove that 
     observer from the area involved.
       ``(B) Notice to committee.--If a designated congressional 
     election observer is removed from an area under subparagraph 
     (A), the election official shall, within 24 hours of the 
     observer's removal--
       ``(i) inform the chair and ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, as applicable; and
       ``(ii) provide written notice detailing the reason or 
     reasons the designated congressional election observer was 
     removed.

     subsection, the mere presence of a designated congressional 
     election observer during an observation of election 
     administration procedures, without any additional indicia 
     supporting a reasonable basis for removal, is not a 
     sufficient reason for removal under paragraph (1)(A).

     congressional election observer is properly removed under 
     paragraph (1)(A), the chair or ranking minority member of the

     `designated congressional election observer' is a House or 
     Senate employee who is designated in writing by the chair or 
     ranking minority member of the Committee on House 
     Administration of the House of Representatives or the 
     Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, or a

     Northern Mariana Islands.''.
       (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 
     401 of such Act (52 U.S.C. 21111) is amended by striking

  SA 3295. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. Hagerty) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 91, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to 60 diplomats, in 
recognition of their bravery and heroism during the Holocaust; as 
follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Forgotten Heroes of the 
     Holocaust Congressional Gold Medal Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The following diplomats will be honored posthumously:

       (2) On September 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis began 
     their invasion of Europe, which started World War II and 
     threw the world into chaos. The Nazi plan of mass murder of 
     the Jewish population was in full motion. As battles were 
     being fought between countries, Jews were being rounded up 
     and sent to concentration camps throughout Europe. This 
     process began a mass exodus of people out of Europe, 
     especially those in the Jewish community.
       (3) During the war, members of the Jewish community used 
     every tool and means at their disposal to flee Nazi tyranny. 
     Thousands tried to flee on trains or boats to escape from 
     Europe.
       (4) While the armies of countries were fighting each other, 
     a handful of diplomats, from around the world, stepped 
     forward and took heroic actions to save Jews fleeing Europe. 
     This was an incredibly dangerous process. If the Nazis 
     discovered the actions of these diplomats they would be 
     expelled, as a few of them were. Also, while worrying about 
     the Nazis, diplomats had to worry about their careers and 
     livelihoods back home. Many of them had strict orders from 
     their home countries to not aid the Jewish population in any 
     way.
       (5) These diplomats used every means at their disposal to 
     help Jews fleeing persecution. One of the most powerful tools 
     the diplomats had to use was the issuing of passports and 
     travel visas contrary to the instruction of the governments 
     of the diplomats. This process alone is responsible for 
     saving hundreds of thousands of Jewish families in Europe. 
     This was not the only tool used as many of the diplomats were 
     connected with the local populations and were great 
     communicators for Jews trying to travel underground. They 
     were able set up safehouses and getaways to hide Jews and 
     especially Jewish children from Nazi authorities. In the most 
     dangerous of times, several of these diplomats confronted the 
     Nazis directly on behalf of the Jews and personally put 
     themselves in grave danger.
       (6) Every diplomat knew the dangers and knew what they were 
     up against, and still pushed forward to save those in the 
     most danger.
       (7) The Congressional Gold Medal authorized under this Act 
     will help remind humanity that when the diplomats were faced 
     with terrible crises, they went beyond the fold, including 
     risking their careers and the lives of themselves and their 
     families, to engage in this humanitarian mission. The 
     diplomats of today and future generations can look towards 
     these heroes and be inspired by their lives of heroism and 
     sacrifice.
       (8) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as stating or 
     implying that this group of honorees encompasses everyone who 
     took this type of heroic action during this era. As the title 
     attests, the ``Forgotten Heroes'' performed these deeds out 
     of righteousness, with no expectation of public acclaim. The 
     sponsors of this Act wish to honor this group of individuals 
     for whose deeds the historical record is currently definitive 
     and well-documented. Given that historical research is 
     ongoing, in the event that robust documentation from 
     professional historians, expert stakeholders, and public 
     input identify others worthy of official recognition, future 
     Congresses retain the right to recognize additional forgotten 
     heroes of the Holocaust pursuant to future legislation.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate 
     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on

From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]

  SA 3296. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. Tester) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 815, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the female 
telephone operators of the Army Signal Corps, known as the ``Hello 
Girls''; as follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Hello Girls Congressional 
     Gold Medal Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war 
     against Germany. As a historically neutral nation, the United 
     States was unprepared to fight a technologically modern 
     conflict overseas. The United States called upon American 
     Telephone and Telegraph (referred to in this section as 
     ``AT&T'') to provide equipment and trained personnel for the 
     Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T executives in Army uniform 
     served at home under the provisions of the Act entitled ``An 
     Act for making further and more effectual provision for the 
     national defense, and for other purposes.'', approved June 3, 
     1916 (referred to in this section as the ``National Defense 
     Act of 1916''), which allowed for the induction of 
     individuals with specialized skills into a reserve force.
       (2) When General John Pershing sailed for Europe in May of 
     1917 as head of the American Expeditionary Forces (referred 
     to in this section as the ``AEF''), he took telephone 
     operating equipment with him in recognition of the inadequacy 
     of European circuitry and with the understanding that 
     telephones would play a key role in battlefield 
     communications for the first time in the history of war.
       (3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF struggled to 
     develop the telephone service necessary for the Army to 
     function under battlefield conditions. Monolingual 
     infantrymen from the United States were unable to connect 
     calls rapidly or communicate effectively with their French 
     counterparts to put calls through over toll lines that linked 
     one region of the country with another. The Army found that 
     the average male operator required 60 seconds to make a 
     connection. That rate was unacceptably slow, especially for 
     operational calls between command outposts and the front 
     lines.
       (4) During this time, in the United States, telephone 
     operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired for their speed 
     in connecting calls, women filled 85 percent of the telephone 
     operating positions in the United States. It took the average 
     female operator 10 seconds to make a connection.
       (5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing cabled the War 
     Department and wrote, ``On account of the great difficulty of 
     obtaining properly qualified men, request organization and 
     dispatch to France a force of women telephone operators all 
     speaking French and English equally well.''. To begin, 
     General Pershing requested 100 women under the command of a 
     commissioned captain, writing that ``All should have 
     allowances of Army nurses and should be uniformed.''.
       (6) The War Department sent press releases to newspapers 
     across the United States to recruit women willing to serve 
     for the duration of the war and face the hazards of submarine 
     warfare and aerial bombardment. These articles emphasized 
     that patriotic women would be ``full-fledged soldier[s] under 
     the articles of war'' and would ``do as much to help win the 
     war as the men in khaki who go `over the top.' ''. All women 
     selected would take the Army oath.
       (7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 100 positions 
     described in paragraph (5), and the first recruits took the 
     Army oath on January 15, 1918.
       (8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female Signal 
     Corps members had relative rather than traditional ranks and 
     were ranked as Operator, Supervisor, or Chief Operator. When 
     promoted, the women were required to swear the Army oath 
     again.
       (9) Telephone operators were the first women to serve as 
     soldiers in non-medical classifications, and the job of the 
     operators was to help win the war, not to mitigate the harms 
     of the war. In popular parlance, they were known as the 
     ``Hello Girls''.
       (10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uniforms and Army 
     insignia always, as well as standard-issue identity disks in 
     case of death, and were subject to court martial for 
     infractions of the military code.
       (11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and their immediate 
     officers, the legal counsel of the Army ruled internally on 
     March 20, 1918, that the women were not actually soldiers but 
     contract employees, even though the women had not seen or 
     signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for the 
     induction of men, and the code remained unchanged despite the 
     orders of General Pershing. Nevertheless, legal counsel also 
     recognized that the National Defense Act of 1916, which 
     allowed for the induction of members of the telephone 
     industry of the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed 
     no gender restrictions.
       (12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the first 
     contingent of operators began their official duties in 
     France. The operators arrived before most infantrymen of the 
     Armed Forces in order to facilitate logistics and deployment 
     and spent their first night in Paris under German 
     bombardment.
       (13) After the arrival of the operators, telephone service 
     in France improved immediately, as calls tripled from 13,000 
     to 36,000 per day.
       (14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and deployed 5 
     additional contingents of female Signal Corps operators. With 
     these personnel, the number of calls increased to 150,000 per 
     day.
       (15) In addition to standard telephone operating, bilingual 
     Signal Corps members provided simultaneous translation 
     between officers from France and officers from the United 
     States, who were communicating by telephone.
       (16) The AEF fought their first major battles in the last 2 
     months of the war. By that point, the Signal Corps considered 
     the contributions of women to be so essential that, in 
     telephone exchanges closest to the front line, the Army 
     exclusively used women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the 
     rear, the Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave 
     male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone traffic was 
     slower.
       (17) Seven bilingual operators--
       (A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne 
     under the immediate command of General Pershing;
       (B) staffed the Operations Boards through which orders to 
     advance, fire, and retreat were delivered to soldiers in the 
     trenches, to artillery units on alert, and to pilots awaiting 
     orders at French airfields; and
       (C) were awarded a ``Defensive Sector Clasp'' for the 
     Meuse-Argonne operation.
       (18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello Girls, Grace 
     Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was awarded the Distinguished 
     Service Medal. Out of 16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, 
     Banker was one of only 18 individuals so honored.
       (19) Thirty additional operators received special 
     commendations, many signed by General Pershing himself, for 
     ``exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous services'' in 
     ``Advance Sections'' of the conflict.
       (20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As of that date, 
     223 female operators served in France and had connected 
     26,000,000 calls for the AEF.
       (21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Signal Corps 
     wrote in his official report 2 days after the date on which 
     the war ended that ``a large part of the success of the 
     communications of this Army is due to . . . a competent staff 
     of women operators.''.
       (22) After the war ended, some women were ordered to 
     Coblenz in Germany for the occupation of that country and to 
     Paris for the Paris Peace Treaty of 1919 to continue 
     telephone operations, sometimes in direct support of 
     President Woodrow Wilson.
       (23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez Crittenden, 
     died in France in the service of the United States and were 
     buried there in military cemeteries with military ceremonies. 
     Those operators died of the same influenza pandemic that 
     killed more soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat 
     operations.
       (24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were ineligible for 
     discharge until formal release. Because of their role in 
     logistics, those women were among the last soldiers to come 
     home to the United States. The last Signal Corps operators 
     returned from France in January of 1920.
       (25) Upon arrival in the United States, the Army informed 
     female veterans that they had performed as civilians, not 
     soldiers, even though operators had served in Army uniform in 
     a theater of war surrounded by men who were similarly 
     engaged.
       (26) Despite the objections of General George Squier, the 
     top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, the Army denied 
     Signal Corps women the veterans' benefits granted to male 
     soldiers and female nurses, such as--
       (A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred in the line 
     of duty;

[[Page S6379]]

       (B) cash bonuses;
       (C) soldiers' pensions;
       (D) flags on their coffins; and
       (E) the Victory Medals promised them in France.
       (27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led by Merle 
     Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress more than 50 times for 
     their recognition. In 1977, under the sponsorship of Senator 
     Barry Goldwater, Congress passed legislation to retroactively 
     acknowledge the military service of the Women's Airforce 
     Service Pilots (referred to in this section as ``WASPs'') of 
     World War II and ``the service of any person in any other 
     similarly situated group the members of which rendered 
     service to the Armed Forces of the United States in a 
     capacity considered civilian employment or contractual 
     service at the time such service was rendered''.
       (28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed 
     the legislation described in paragraph (27) into law as the 
     GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 91 Stat. 
     1433).
       (29) The Signal Corps telephone operators applied for, and 
     were granted, status as veterans in 1979.
       (30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned home after 
     the war were still alive to receive their Victory Medals and 
     official discharge papers, which were finally awarded in 
     1979.
       (31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Massachusetts, 
     returned to the United States after the war, where she worked 
     on the professional staff of Congresswoman Edith Nourse 
     Rogers. Shaw lived to receive her honorable discharge and was 
     the first burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery 
     opened on October 11, 1980. Shaw's uniform is on display at 
     the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, 
     Missouri.
       (32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at a ceremony 
     in her home in Marine City, Michigan, ``Hello Girl'' Oleda 
     Joure Christides raised the paper to her lips and kissed it. 
     The only thing Christides ever wanted from the Federal 
     Government was a flag on her coffin.
       (33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into 
     law Public Law 111-40 (123 Stat. 1958), which awarded the 
     WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal for their service to the 
     United States.
       (34) For their role as pioneers who paved the way for all 
     women in uniform, and for service that was essential to 
     victory in World War I, the ``Hello Girls'' merit similar 
     recognition.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

       (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate

From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]

  SA 3297. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. McConnell) proposed an amendment to the 
bill H.R. 6513, to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to confirm 
the requirement that States allow access to designated congressional 
election observers to observe the election administration procedures in 
congressional elections; as follows:

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Confirmation Of 
     Congressional Observer Access Act of 2024'' or the ``COCOA 
     Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       (a) Access Required.--Title III of the Help America Vote 
     Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amended--
       (1) by redesignating section 304 and 305 as sections 305 
     and 306; and
       (2) by inserting after section 303 the following new 
     section:

     ``SEC. 304. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       ``(a) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds 
     that, regardless of legislative action, it has the authority 
     to send congressional election observers to observe polling 
     locations, any location where processing, scanning, 
     tabulating, canvassing, recounting, auditing, or certifying 
     voting results is occurring, or any other part of the process 
     associated with elections for Federal office under the 
     authorities granted under article 1, section 5, clause 1 and 
     article 1, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution of the 
     United States. Procedures described herein do not establish 
     any new authorities or procedures with respect to Congress' 
     constitutional authority to observe congressional elections 
     but are provided simply to permit a convenient statutory 
     reference for existing congressional authority and activity.
       ``(b) Requiring States To Provide Access for Observers.--
       ``(1) Requirement.--A State shall provide each individual 
     who is acting as a designated congressional election observer 
     for an election for Federal office with full access to 
     clearly observe all elements of election administration 
     procedures, including, but not limited to, access to any area 
     in which a ballot is cast, processed, scanned, tabulated, 
     canvassed, recounted, audited, or certified, including during 
     pre- and post-election procedures.
       ``(2) Restrictions on activities of observers.--No 
     designated congressional election observer may handle a 
     ballot or election equipment (whether voting or nonvoting or 
     whether tabulating or nontabulating), advocate for any 
     position or candidate, take any action to reduce ballot 
     secrecy or voter privacy, take any action to interfere with 
     the ability of a voter to cast a ballot or an election 
     administrator to carry the administrator's duties, or 
     otherwise interfere with the election administration process.
       ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
     prohibit a designated congressional election observer from 
     asking questions of an election administrator, election 
     official, or election worker, or any other State or local 
     official.
       ``(c) Conduct of Observers.--
       ``(1) Removal.--
       ``(A) Authorization removal by election official.--If a 
     State or local election official has a reasonable basis to 
     believe that a designated congressional election observer has 
     engaged in or imminently will engage in intimidation or 
     deceptive practices prohibited by Federal law, or in the 
     disruption of voting, processing, scanning, tabulating, 
     canvassing, or recounting of ballots, or the certification of 
     results, a State or local election official may remove that 
     observer from the area involved.
       ``(B) Notice to committee.--If a designated congressional 
     election observer is removed from an area under subparagraph 
     (A), the election official shall, within 24 hours of the 
     observer's removal--
       ``(i) inform the chair and ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, as applicable; and
       ``(ii) provide written notice detailing the reason or 
     reasons the designated congressional election observer was 
     removed.
       ``(2) Rule of construction.--For purposes of this 
     subsection, the mere presence of a designated congressional 
     election observer during an observation of election 
     administration procedures, without any additional indicia 
     supporting a reasonable basis for removal, is not a 
     sufficient reason for removal under paragraph (1)(A).
       ``(3) Right to replace observer.--If a designated 
     congressional election observer is properly removed under 
     paragraph (1)(A), the chair or ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, as appropriate, may send another designated 
     congressional election observer as a replacement for the 
     remaining duration of the observation of election 
     administration procedures.
       ``(d) Designated Congressional Election Observer 
     Described.--In this section, a

[[Page S6380]]

     `designated congressional election observer' is a House or 
     Senate employee who is designated in writing by the chair or 
     ranking minority member of the Committee on House 
     Administration of the House of Representatives or the 
     Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate, or a 
     successor committee, to gather information with respect to an 
     election, including in the event that the election is 
     contested in the House of Representatives or the Senate and 
     for other purposes permitted by article 1, section 5, clause 
     1 and article 1, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution of 
     the United States.
       ``(e) State Defined.--In this section, the term `State' 
     means each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the 
     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin 
     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the 
     Northern Mariana Islands.''.
       (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 
     401 of such Act (52 U.S.C. 21111) is amended by striking 
     ``and 303'' and inserting ``303, and 304''.
       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of such Act 
     is amended--
       (1) by redesignating the items relating to sections 304 and 
     305 as relating to sections 305 and 306; and

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The following diplomats will be honored posthumously: 
     Per Anger (Sweden), Jose Maria Barreto Bustios (Peru), Lars 
     Berg (Sweden), Philippe Bernardini (Vatican/Italy), Hiram 
     (Harry) Bingham IV (United States), Friedrich Born 
     (Switzerland), Gilberto Bosques Saldivar (Mexico), Carlos de 
     Liz-Texeira Branquinho (Portugal), Samuel del Campo (Chile), 
     Aracy de Carvalho Guimaraes Rosa (Brazil), Jose Arturo 
     Castellanos Contreras (El Salvador), Carl Ivan Danielsson

     Ferdinand Duckwitz (Germany), Harald Feller (Switzerland), 
     Francis (Frank) Foley (United Kingdom), Jean-Edouard 
     Friedrich (Switzerland), Carlos Almeida Afonseca de Sampaio 
     Garrido (Portugal), Raymond Herman Geist (United States), 
     Feng-Shan Ho (Republic of China), Constantin Karadja 
     (Romania), Alexander Kasser (Sandor Kasza) (Sweden), Elow 
     Kihlgren (Sweden), Joseph Willem (Joop) Kolkman 
     (Netherlands), Julius Kuhl (Poland), Aleksander 4ados 
     (Poland), Valdemar Langlet (Sweden), Charles (Carl) Lutz 
     (Switzerland), George Mandel-Mantello (El Salvador), Florian 
     Manoliu (Romania), Manuel Antonio Munoz Borrero (Ecuador), 
     Salomon Jacob (Sally) Noach (Netherlands), Giorgio (Jorge) 
     Perlasca (Spain/Italy), Ernst Prodolliet (Switzerland), 
     Eduardo Propper de Callejon (Spain), Franjo Puncuch 
     (Yugoslavia/Slovenia), Konstanty Rokicki (Poland), Sebastian 
     de Romero Radigales (Spain), Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli 
     (Vatican/Italy), Angelo Rotta (Vatican/Italy), Albert Emile 
     Routier (Turkey/France), Jose Ruiz Santaella (Spain), Stefan 
     Ryniewicz (Poland), Angel Sanz-Briz (Spain), Abdol-Hossein 
     Sardari (Iran), Henryk Slawik (Poland), Robert Smallbones 
     (United Kingdom), Aristides de Sousa Mendes (Portugal), Jan 
     Spisiak (Slovakia), Chiune (Sempo) Sugihara (Japan), 
     Ireanaeus Typaldos (Spain), Alexander (Sandor) Ujvary 
     (Vatican/Hungary), Selahattin Ulkumen (Turkey), Gennaro 
     Verolino (Vatican/Italy), Vladimir Vochoc (Czech Republic), 
     Ernst Vonrufs (Switzerland), Raoul Wallenberg (Sweden), 
     Guelfo Zamboni (Italy), Peter Zurcher (Switzerland), and Jan 
     Zwartendijk (Netherlands).
       (2) On September 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis began 
     their invasion of Europe, which started World War II and 
     threw the world into chaos. The Nazi plan of mass murder of 
     the Jewish population was in full motion. As battles were 
     being fought between countries, Jews were being rounded up 
     and sent to concentration camps throughout Europe. This 
     process began a mass exodus of people out of Europe, 
     especially those in the Jewish community.
       (3) During the war, members of the Jewish community used 
     every tool and means at their disposal to flee Nazi tyranny. 
     Thousands tried to flee on trains or boats to escape from 
     Europe.
       (4) While the armies of countries were fighting each other, 
     a handful of diplomats, from around the world, stepped 
     forward and took heroic actions to save Jews fleeing Europe. 
     This was an incredibly dangerous process. If the Nazis 
     discovered the actions of these diplomats they would be 
     expelled, as a few of them were. Also, while worrying about 
     the Nazis, diplomats had to worry about their careers and 
     livelihoods back home. Many of them had strict orders from 
     their home countries to not aid the Jewish population in any 
     way.
       (5) These diplomats used every means at their disposal to 
     help Jews fleeing persecution. One of the most powerful tools 
     the diplomats had to use was the issuing of passports and 
     travel visas contrary to the instruction of the governments 
     of the diplomats. This process alone is responsible for 
     saving hundreds of thousands of Jewish families in Europe. 
     This was not the only tool used as many of the diplomats were 
     connected with the local populations and were great 
     communicators for Jews trying to travel underground. They 
     were able set up safehouses and getaways to hide Jews and 
     especially Jewish children from Nazi authorities. In the most 
     dangerous of times, several of these diplomats confronted the 
     Nazis directly on behalf of the Jews and personally put 
     themselves in grave danger.
       (6) Every diplomat knew the dangers and knew what they were 
     up against, and still pushed forward to save those in the 
     most danger.
       (7) The Congressional Gold Medal authorized under this Act 
     will help remind humanity that when the diplomats were faced 
     with terrible crises, they went beyond the fold, including 
     risking their careers and the lives of themselves and their 
     families, to engage in this humanitarian mission. The 
     diplomats of today and future generations can look towards 
     these heroes and be inspired by their lives of heroism and 
     sacrifice.
       (8) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as stating or 
     implying that this group of honorees encompasses everyone who 
     took this type of heroic action during this era. As the title 
     attests, the ``Forgotten Heroes'' performed these deeds out 
     of righteousness, with no expectation of public acclaim. The 
     sponsors of this Act wish to honor this group of individuals 
     for whose deeds the historical record is currently definitive 
     and well-documented. Given that historical research is 
     ongoing, in the event that robust documentation from 
     professional historians, expert stakeholders, and public 
     input identify others worthy of official recognition, future 
     Congresses retain the right to recognize additional forgotten 
     heroes of the Holocaust pursuant to future legislation.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate 
     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on 
     behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate 
     design in honor of the 60 diplomats identified in section 
     2(1), in recognition of their brave and vital service of 
     saving Jews during World War II.
       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation 
     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury 
     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a 
     single gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and 
     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.
       (c) Presentation of Medal.--The single gold medal presented 
     under subsection (a) shall be presented collectively to the

     delegation consisting of a senior official representative of 
     the country that each diplomat served and the cochairs of the

       (d) United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.--
       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in 
     honor of the 60 diplomats identified in section 2(1), the 
     gold medal shall be given to the United States Holocaust 
     Memorial Museum, where it will be available for display as

                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY

  Mr. President, in two criminal cases pending in Federal district

witness.
  In these cases, brought against Martin Cudo and Edward Kelley, 
respectively, trials are expected to commence in late October, and the 
prosecution has requested testimony from Daniel Schwager, formerly 
counsel to the Secretary of the Senate, concerning his knowledge and 
observations of the process, including use of the electoral ballots and 
other documents during the proceeding, and constitutional and legal 
bases for Congress's counting of of the Electoral College votes. Senate 
Secretary Berry would like to cooperate with these requests by 
providing relevant testimony in these trials from Mr. Schwager.
  In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, these 
resolutions would authorize the production of relevant testimony from 
Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.
  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed 
to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

       CONFIRMATION OF CONGRESSIONAL OBSERVER ACCESS ACT OF 2023

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
Committee on Rules and Administration be discharged from further 
consideration of H.R. 6513 and the Senate proceed to its immediate

     2002 to confirm the requirement that States allow access to 
     designated congressional election observers to observe the

  There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the

the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The amendment (No. 3297) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to 
as follows:

                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)

        Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Confirmation Of 
     Congressional Observer Access Act of 2024'' or the ``COCOA 
     Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       (a) Access Required.--Title III of the Help America Vote 
     Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amended--
       (1) by redesignating section 304 and 305 as sections 305 
     and 306; and
       (2) by inserting after section 303 the following new 
     section:

     ``SEC. 304. ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

       ``(a) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds 
     that, regardless of legislative action, it has the authority 
     to send congressional election observers to observe polling 
     locations, any location where processing, scanning, 
     tabulating, canvassing, recounting, auditing, or certifying 
     voting results is occurring, or any other part of the process 
     associated with elections for Federal office under the 
     authorities granted under article 1, section 5, clause 1 and 
     article 1, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution of the 
     United States. Procedures described herein do not establish 
     any new authorities or procedures with respect to Congress' 
     constitutional authority to observe congressional elections 
     but are provided simply to permit a convenient statutory 
     reference for existing congressional authority and activity.
       ``(b) Requiring States To Provide Access for Observers.--
       ``(1) Requirement.--A State shall provide each individual 
     who is acting as a designated congressional election observer 
     for an election for Federal office with full access to 
     clearly observe all elements of election administration 
     procedures, including, but not limited to, access to any area 
     in which a ballot is cast, processed, scanned, tabulated, 
     canvassed, recounted, audited, or certified, including during 
     pre- and post-election procedures.
       ``(2) Restrictions on activities of observers.--No 
     designated congressional election observer may handle a 
     ballot or election equipment (whether voting or nonvoting or 
     whether tabulating or nontabulating), advocate for any 
     position or candidate, take any action to reduce ballot 
     secrecy or voter privacy, take any action to interfere with 
     the ability of a voter to cast a ballot or an election 
     administrator to carry the administrator's duties, or 
     otherwise interfere with the election administration process.
       ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
     prohibit a designated congressional election observer from 
     asking questions of an election administrator, election 
     official, or election worker, or any other State or local 
     official.

[[Page S6383]]

       ``(c) Conduct of Observers.--
       ``(1) Removal.--
       ``(A) Authorization removal by election official.--If a 
     State or local election official has a reasonable basis to 
     believe that a designated congressional election observer has 
     engaged in or imminently will engage in intimidation or 
     deceptive practices prohibited by Federal law, or in the 
     disruption of voting, processing, scanning, tabulating, 
     canvassing, or recounting of ballots, or the certification of 
     results, a State or local election official may remove that 
     observer from the area involved.
       ``(B) Notice to committee.--If a designated congressional 
     election observer is removed from an area under subparagraph 
     (A), the election official shall, within 24 hours of the 
     observer's removal--
       ``(i) inform the chair and ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, as applicable; and
       ``(ii) provide written notice detailing the reason or 
     reasons the designated congressional election observer was 
     removed.
       ``(2) Rule of construction.--For purposes of this 
     subsection, the mere presence of a designated congressional 
     election observer during an observation of election 
     administration procedures, without any additional indicia 
     supporting a reasonable basis for removal, is not a 
     sufficient reason for removal under paragraph (1)(A).
       ``(3) Right to replace observer.--If a designated 
     congressional election observer is properly removed under 
     paragraph (1)(A), the chair or ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, as appropriate, may send another designated 
     congressional election observer as a replacement for the 
     remaining duration of the observation of election 
     administration procedures.
       ``(d) Designated Congressional Election Observer 
     Described.--In this section, a `designated congressional 
     election observer' is a House or Senate employee who is 
     designated in writing by the chair or ranking minority member 
     of the Committee on House Administration of the House of 
     Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration 
     of the Senate, or a successor committee, to gather 
     information with respect to an election, including in the 
     event that the election is contested in the House of 
     Representatives or the Senate and for other purposes 
     permitted by article 1, section 5, clause 1 and article 1, 
     section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States.
       ``(e) State Defined.--In this section, the term `State' 
     means each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the 
     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin 
     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the 
     Northern Mariana Islands.''.
       (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 
     401 of such Act (52 U.S.C. 21111) is amended by striking 
     ``and 303'' and inserting ``303, and 304''.
       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of such Act 
     is amended--
       (1) by redesignating the items relating to sections 304 and 
     305 as relating to sections 305 and 306; and
       (2) by inserting after the item relating to section 303 the 
     following:

``Sec. 304. Confirming access for congressional election observers.''.
  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time.
  The bill was read the third time.
  The bill (H.R. 6513), as amended, was passed.

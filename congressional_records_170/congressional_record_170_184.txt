institution and the people it serves.
  I first met Veleter M.B. Mazyck in 2017 when I was selected to 
participate in the CBC Institute bootcamp. I could not have known then 
that four years later Veleter would become not only my chief of staff 
but also a trusted advisor, confidant and an unwavering partner in 
serving the people of Ohio's Eleventh Congressional District.
  A steady hand who had served my predecessor for more than a decade, 
Veleter has been vital to the success of my office ever since.
  As she prepares to retire, I rise to recognize a career defined by 
integrity, selflessness, and an unwavering commitment to public 
service.
  Too often, the contributions of Congressional staff remain behind the 
scenes--unnoticed by the public, but essential to our democracy.
  Far from the cameras, the House chamber, or the committee dais, staff 
work long hours--they are driven by a deep and abiding sense of duty.
  Veleter Mazyck personifies this culturally, spiritually and 
professionally.
  She is known for being both wise and witty, spontaneous and 
strategic, careful and kind, thoughtful and thorough but most 
importantly a loving, loyal, steady and steadfast steward of our 
Nation. And a calm and commanding force behind every success.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Veleter Mazyck ensuring her legacy 
endures for years to come.
  An unsung hero of this institution, Veleter committed herself to 
honing the skills and talents the Lord had blessed her with . . . To 
bending the moral arc of the universe that little bit closer to justice 
. . . And to ensuring our government serves its people with respect, 
dignity, and compassion.
  After a celebrated career as a General Counsel to large metropolitan 
school districts, Veleter agreed to serve as Congresswoman Fudge's 
Chief of Staff--for one year or maybe two.
  And yet--a decade later . . . Veleter was still here--a cornerstone 
of the office, the Congress and, dare I say, the country and the 
constitution.
  Through her efforts, legislative priorities were championed with 
purpose and passion, crises were managed with character and charisma, 
and partnerships were forged both publicly and privately--all with the 
goal of creating a better future for the people of Ohio's Eleventh 
District.
  Following my predecessor's appointment to President Joe Biden's 
cabinet, Veleter skillfully managed the office during the transition, 
ensuring constituents continued to receive the support they needed.
  Upon my swearing in, her wealth of experience and knowledge allowed 
me to confidently step into my role. Ever since, Veleter's deep 
understanding of this institution has been invaluable.
  In moments of uncertainty, Veleter was the steady hand, navigating 
challenges with poise and resolve. In moments of triumph, she 
celebrated not personal accolades, but the victories achieved for the 
people of Northeast Ohio. And in every moment in between, she 
exemplified the highest standards of professionalism and dedication.
  What truly sets Veleter apart is her ability to bring out the best in 
those around her.
  Whether mentoring young staffers or building coalitions with 
colleagues, she led with patience, humility, and a genuine belief in 
the power of collaboration.
  After 13 years, the countless individuals she has impacted, from 
colleagues to constituents, are a testament to the lasting influence 
she has had on all who have worked with her.
  Those testimonials include the following reflections from former 
colleagues:
  Eyang Garrison: ``Veleter once told me she believed smart people 
could do anything and I've never forgotten that. I often think back on 
her saying that to me when I interviewed with her back in 2019 after I 
expressed doubts about newly taking on a managerial role. To feel that 
someone as well respected as Veleter, saw something in me that at the 
time I didn't see in myself, was one of the most influential moments in 
my professional career. There really is no one like Veleter. Thank you 
for your love and support for both me and my family throughout the 
years. Love you!''
  Kellie Adesina: ``When I reflect on my career on Capitol Hill, I 
often refer to my time in former Rep. Marcia L. Fudge's office as the 
transformative years that helped shape me into the government affairs 
professional I am today. My experience was, in large part, due to the 
guidance, firm support, and encouragement from Veleter. As her 
Legislative Director, she empowered me to lead, never allowed me to 
settle for mediocrity, and demonstrated through her actions what it 
meant to guide a team with grace, humility, and compassion. I'm forever 
grateful for the impact she's made on my life and wish her the very 
best of everything as she retires from federal service because she 
deserves it and more.''
  LaDavia Drane: ``Veleter and I shared an office back in the early 
2010s. I can recall so clearly the day she was introduced to the team 
by our member of Congress. Veleter inspired me, and demanded of me, to 
do my very best at work every single day. She modeled the high 
standards of a woman in politics on the Hill, providing me with a safe 
place to learn and grow. I miss those days and will always fondly 
remember our time together. I wish Veleter the best as she journeys 
forward. I hope she'll continue to teach, mentor and coach, as she did 
for me, wherever she spends her time after her retirement from the 
Hill. Love you, Veleter!''
  Kim Edwards: ``Veleter is the kind of person I wish I had met earlier 
in my professional journey. From the moment I joined Congresswoman 
Brown's team, she quickly became not only a role model but also a 
source of clarity and focus. One of the most striking things about 
Veleter is her ability to cut through the noise. She expected clear, 
concise communication, particularly when it came to goals and direction 
for the team. To her, everything else was secondary. Her 
straightforward, no-nonsense approach taught me the importance of 
focus, discipline, and above all, staying priority driven. Veleter and 
I also made a great team--she, a Green from the Pace Color Palette, 
always demanding excellence from our staff, and I, a Blue, often 
seeking to find the best in everyone. Together, we struck a balance 
that helped us elevate the work we did while maintaining a positive, 
collaborative environment. At the end of the day, Veleter always knew 
how to analyze the situation, identify the key priorities, and get the 
work done. She leaves behind a legacy of strength, leadership, and 
unwavering dedication to the work she did for the people of OH-11. I am 
grateful for the opportunity to have worked with her and to have 
learned so much along the way. Wishing you all the best in your 
retirement, Veleter. You will be greatly missed.''
  Jasmine Butler: ``Veleter has been one of the most impactful mentors 
in my life. I had no idea what to expect or how to prepare to work in a 
Congressional office when I arrived on the Hill on November 15, 2021. 
What I appreciate most about my experience with Veleter is that she 
required a level of excellence that pushed me beyond what I thought I 
could achieve. She embodies unapologetic excellence, refusing to shrink 
for the sake of others. To witness another Black woman so fearless and 
bold in the presence of those who may consider themselves more 
prominent helped me subconsciously eliminate personal beliefs of 
unworthiness. She showed all of us that we can do and achieve anything. 
It was no cliche. It was our reality because she required excellence, 
innovation, and the highest level of service to the constituents of 
Ohio's Eleventh Congressional District. I cannot thank her enough for 
her impact on me as a professional, a confidant, and a friend. I wish 
her all the joy, love, excitement, new adventures, and peace her heart 
can hold. She truly deserves that and so much more.''
  Imani Edwards: ``Without the mentorship, correction, and love from 
Veleter Mazyck, I would not be the woman or professional I am today. 
Veleter has a way of always making you want to try harder and show up 
as the absolute best version of yourself. As a young Black woman 
navigating Capitol Hill, Veleter reminded me that if I could find a way 
to excel in midst of chaos, trial by fire is how she put it, then no 
person, place or thing would ever hinder my success. She gave me a 
confidence that I continue to carry with me in any professional arena I 
enter. I wish her all the

[[Page E1256]]

best in her well-deserved retirement! Thank you for everything, 
Veleter!''
  As Veleter steps away from Capitol Hill, I know that her 
contributions will continue to ripple outward. The legacy she leaves is 
one of progress, integrity, and hope.
  Throughout her career, she has often spoken about the importance of 
getting off the dance floor. It was, as she says, your role as a leader 
is to get to the balcony--to better see the bigger picture.
  As she retires, it's time to leave both the balcony and the dance 
floor behind. Now, the stage is her's to set. Whether it's traveling, 
writing, or pursuing new passions--retirement is her front-row seat to 
a life of her own design.
  On behalf of a grateful Congress, a grateful district, and a grateful 
Nation, I thank her. I thank her for her vision, virtue and vigilance. 
We are better because of her sacrifice, and for her unwavering 
commitment to seeing our Nation not for what it was--but for what it 
could be.
  We wish her all the best in her well-earned retirement, with full 
confidence that her impact on this institution and the Nation it serves 
will live on for generations to come.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JASON CROW

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank one of my 
constituents, chief meteorologist Mike Nelson, for his service to 
Colorado. For 33 years, Mr. Nelson has appeared on our TVs, providing 
informed and crucial weather reports to help Colorado families prepare 
for blizzards, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. Mr. Nelson has also 
been there in the moments of calm--when a day spells blue skies, warm 
sun, and for many, time spent in Colorado's great outdoors.
  Mr. Nelson, chief meteorologist of Denver7 since 2004, has not only 
informed Coloradans of weather reports but has profoundly affected how 
we receive weather reporting in the U.S. In 1979, he and his colleague 
Terry Kelly devised one of the first computer weather graphics 
systems--one which continues to be the most widely embraced system in 
the country. Mr. Nelson also introduced the first weather computer to 
Colorado in 1982.
  With 20 Emmy awards, including 18 for Outstanding Weather Anchor, Mr. 
Nelson has served Colorado by making weather and climate change 
reporting more accessible. His dedication to weather reporting has gone 
beyond the TV screen. He has been actively involved in educating 
hundreds of thousands of students, including with his tornado dance, 
and, most recently, writing `The World's Littlest Book on Climate,' a 
book geared towards climate outreach and education.
  I join Coloradans in congratulating Mike Nelson on his retirement 
after nearly 50 years on television and thank him for his commitment to 
our state.

challenges throughout her life. Yet, with courage and determination, 
she has transformed those experiences into a powerful source of 
inspiration, encouraging others to believe in themselves and turn both 
triumphs and trials into fuel for progress.
  Professionally, Shequite has devoted herself to roles within the 
helping professions, using each opportunity to foster community 
advancement and personal growth. Her journey reflects her deep 
commitment to community empowerment and personal growth. Her impactfid 
AmeriCorps service, where she supported individuals facing generational 
poverty and limited resources, ignited her passion for economic and 
social transformation. This inspired her to pursue higher education, 
earning degrees in Criminal Justice, Rural Public Policy and Planning, 
and now a Ph.D. in Public Administration.
  Professionally, Shequite advanced through roles in the Sunflower 
County Consolidated School District and later joined Higher Purpose Co.

Program Officer, she contributes to reshaping narratives around poverty 
and fostering financial and cultural empowerment.
  Beyond her career, Shequite is an active volunteer, leading Girl 
Scout Troop 30123, serving with the Sunflower County Freedom Project, 
and participating in organizations like the Mississippi Valley State 
Alumni Association, the NAACP, and a plethora of meaningful and

service inspires others and creates meaningful change in her community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. 
Shequite Johnson for her dedication and tenacity to serving her 
community and desire to be an example for all.

                  TRIBUTE TO MARY WITHERSPOON BLANDING

                                 ______

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a long-time 
public servant in my hometown of Sumter, South Carolina. Mrs. Mary 
Witherspoon Blanding is retiring as Clerk to the Sumter County Council 
after 34 years. Mrs. Blanding was selected as County Clerk in April, 
1990 and is the longest serving Clerk in Sumter County Council history.
  Mrs. Blanding is the third child of the late Dea. John Ivory 
Witherspoon and the late Deaconess Dorothy Mae Smith Witherspoon. She 
grew up in South Sumter and attended Sumter County schools during the 
days of segregation. After graduating from Sumter High School, she 
received a Diploma from Palmer Junior College and a Bachelor of Science 
Degree from Morris College. She later attended Phoenix University, and 
earned her certification as a Certified Clerk to County and 
Certification as a Master Clerk to County Council from the Riley Center 
of the College of Charleston. Mary is also certified as a Dean of 
Christian Education through the South Carolina Baptist Congress of 
Christian Education (SCBCCE), where she also earned her teacher 
Certificate and a Diploma for Christian Education.
  Mrs. Blandings public service stems from many years of volunteer 
services rendered toward grassroots efforts, in schools, and faith-
based activities throughout Sumter and Clarendon Counties. She has 
served as a committee member of the Sumter Chamber of Commerce, the 
former Secretary and Treasurer of the Santee Wateree Regional 
Transportation Board of Directors, and a member of the Business and 
Office Advisory Board for Central Carolina Technical College. During 
her tenure on the S.C. Clerks to Council Association, she was selected 
as President and served on the Certification Committee. She is also an 
active member of the newly established Women Pioneer Luncheon Committee 
and, in 2020, served as an Honorary Wing Commander at Shaw Air Force 
Base.
  Over her career, Mrs. Blanding has been selected for numerous honors 
and awards, such as the J. T. McCain Public Service Award, the American 
Association of Women in Community and Junior Colleges Award, a TWIN 
Honoree (Tribute to Women In Business and Industry), a Government 
Honoree for Mt. Zion Baptist Church Black History Month, and the Woman 
of Excellence Award by the Social Justice Consortium.
  Prior to her professional career, Mrs. Blanding became the first 
student to be honored as Miss Sumter High School in 1970, and the first 
Black student crowned as Ms. Palmer Junior College in Charleston, South 
Carolina.
  Mrs. Blanding is married to Kenneth Orlando Blanding. They have four 
children, Jamie (Carl), Kimberly (Eric), Elijah, and Zoie, and two 
grandsons, Brian and Micah. She is a member of Hopewell Baptist Church 
where she serves as a Deaconess, Program Committee Chairwoman, 
Christian Education Director, Church School Teacher, and a member of 
the Praise and Workshop Ministry, Sanctuary Choir, and Women Ministry.
  She loves gardening--especially herbs, peppers, and tomatoes--and 
traveling and trying new dishes during her travel. Mrs. Blanding has 
fostered peace and prosperity for the entire Sumter Community 
throughout her decades of service. One of Mrs. Blanding's life mottos 
is ``as much as possible within you, live peaceably with all persons.''
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing 
the remarkable career of Mrs. Mary Witherspoon Blanding, and wishing 
her continued success and many

blessings as she begins the next chapter of her life.

  Mr. IVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a true American hero, 
Lieutenant George T. McCree, III, from Clinton, Maryland. Lt. McCree's 
service to our Nation and to this Capitol deserves our highest praise 
and recognition.
  In his various roles with the United States Capitol Police, Lt. 
McCree protected not only this hallowed institution, but also the 
principles it represents: democracy, justice, and opportunity. He 
served in many capacities here on the Hill including as a dispatcher, 
special agent, instructor, sergeant, and lieutenant. Those who worked 
alongside him remember his professionalism, his quiet strength, and his 
unshakeable commitment to ensuring that the Capitol remained a beacon 
of freedom and governance. Lt. McCree's story reminds us that the 
legacy of those who serve is not just written in the battles they 
fight, but also in the lives they touch and the barrier they break. As 
we stand here today, in a building he has protected, let us remember 
his myriad contributions. I know that even as Lt. McCree retires from 
the United States Capitol Police, that he will continue to serve his 
community and our region as an involved citizen, parent and proud 
military veteran.

RECOGNIZING MY EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, JULIA LOPEZ, FOR HER EXCELLENT WORK 
         ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Executive 
Assistant, Julia Lopez, for her work on behalf of every constituent in 
Minnesota's Third Congressional District. I could not be more proud of 
grateful for her service.
  Born and raised in Athens, Georgia to proud Filipino immigrants, 
Julia attended the University of Georgia, where she studied 
Anthropology and Asian American Studies. While in Georgia, she 
spearheaded the COVID-19 vaccine program at her family's pediatrics 
clinic and was one of the earliest programs in northeast Georgia to 
have vaccines available for under-represented communities and low-
income families of color. She was active in Filipino student 
organizations while at UGA and has brought her passion for Asian 
American communities to the Hill. Julia first started in my office 
through the Asian Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studies 
(APAICS) placement program in spring 2022 and joined our team full time 
in February 2023 as our Executive Assistant.
  A proud Filipina American, Georgian, and student group 
extraordinaire, there's nobody better at bringing positive energy a 
room than Julia. Julia is a great role model for all our interns and 
one of the biggest reasons why they have such a great experience in our 
office. Julia has been a critical part of making sure the office runs 
smoothly. Julia's commitment to ensuring students visiting our office 
in Washington, DC have an engaging and informative experience is 
admirable. She has personally ensured that hundreds of MN-03 students 
have met with me and toured our Nation's Capitol.
  Julia exemplified Radical Hospitality by always going above and 
beyond for constituents and spreading joy to those around her. She is 
credited with starting the ``Joke of the Day'' tradition in my daily 
briefing books, which provided-much needed moments of levity during 
particularly stressful days. She was willing to take on any and all 
tasks and do it with a smile. Julia's role has shifted at multiple 
points during her tenure with our team--and she has been willing and 
eager to ride the waves as our needs as an organization have changed. 
From working with my Senior Advisor during my time on the Democratic 
Policy and Communications Committee, to assisting my Staff Assistant 
with tours, Julia's flexibility has been a critical asset.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Julia all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for two 
years of faithful service to this Nation.

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chairwoman Kay 
Granger on her retirement and congratulate her on three decades of 
dedicated service to the 12th Congressional District of Texas and the 
United States of America.
  Chairwoman Granger has been a great friend and confidant to me, 
providing guidance and giving helpful advice. As a senior member of the 
Texas delegation, Chairwoman Granger has been an influential, 
conservative leader who prioritized the 12th Congressional District of 
Texas and has led the Appropriations Committee with ample experience, 
wisdom, and grace.
  From being the first Republican Congresswoman from Texas to being the 
first Republican woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee, 
Congresswoman Granger will be leaving with an impactful legacy. She has 
always fought for our national security, our troops, and Veterans, to 
provide all the support they need for their daily sacrifice to our 
Nation.
  I have been honored to work with the Chairwoman on advancing 
legislation that benefits Texans and strengthens our state 
economically. On behalf of her constituents, the Texas delegation, and 
Republican colleagues, Kay will be greatly missed and our Nation thanks 
her for her commitment to America.

            INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 5012--SHINE FOR AUTUMN ACT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on 
stillbirth which is a maternal and infant health crisis that tragically 
accounts for the deaths of over 21,000 babies every year in our 
country. Studies indicate that at least 25 percent of U.S. stillbirths 
are preventable, and addressing these preventable cases could save at 
least 5,250 babies each year. Sadly, despite these alarming statistics, 
stillbirth is one of the most underfunded and underresearched public 
health issues today.
  To address high stillbirth rates, we need to improve data collection, 
research, and awareness. I introduced the bipartisan Stillbirth Health 
Improvement and Education (SHINE) for Autumn Act, H.R. 5012, with Rep. 
Kathy Castor that would do just that. The SHINE Act creates the first 
comprehensive federal-state partnership to streamline data collection 
on stillbirth across the Nation.
  I would like to include in the record a link to more than 1,500 
testimonies from parents and families affected by stillbirth: <a href='https://
youngkim.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/H'>https://
youngkim.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/H</a>.R.-5012-SHINE-for-Autumn-Act-
Testimonies-1.pdf. I hope for swift action from Congress to ensure 
healthier pregnancies and decrease stillbirth rates.

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sarpy County 
Sheriff Jeff Davis, who has selflessly given 51 years of his life to 
``protect and serve'' the residents of Sarpy County, Nebraska. Sheriff 
Davis started as a dispatcher in 1973 at the age of 18. After getting 
his law enforcement officer certification, Davis became a deputy 
sheriff for Sarpy County in 1974. Working his way through the ranks, he 
became a sergeant in 1985, lieutenant in 1989, captain in 1990, and 
chief deputy in 1999. In May 2005, Sheriff Davis was appointed to serve 
the remaining term of Sherriff Pat Thomas, who retired. He subsequently 
won reelection in 2006 and has served diligently in that capacity since 
then.
  He was recognized in 2019 for his work when he was inducted into the 
Nebraska Sheriffs Association Hall of Fame. Davis's other achievements 
include serving as the past president and vice president of the Sarpy 
County Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 and receiving the ``Michael J. 
Elman Officer of the Year'' Award He received the Bellevue Kiwanis 
Chapter ``Officer of the Year'' award. While serving a term on the 
Bellevue City Council in 1996, Davis was presented the ``Jewel of 
Bellevue'' award by Past Bellevue Mayor Boyd.
  Sheriff Davis has worked on many initiatives to handle the growing 
population of Sarpy County. The department routinely trains in Standard 
Response Protocol, working with

[[Page E1258]]

schools, first responders, and medical facilities. Another area of 
focus for Sheriff Davis has been the Sarpy County Sheriffs Sex Offender 
Registry, which allows residents to locate sex offenders on a website. 
He has also focused on resources to identify and treat mental illness, 
with a goal of reducing crime and to better assist victims of mental 
health illness.
  Sheriff Davis is proud of these accomplishments and more, but the one 
he is most proud of is the ``Project Life Saver'' program. Through this 
program, over 80 autistic childien and adults with dementia have been 
fitted with bracelets so they can easily be found when they wander.
  A native of Bellevue, Nebraska, Sheriff Davis also serves on the 
Nebraska Crime Commission, Nebraska Crime Victims Reparations Program, 
and the Nebraska State Council for Interstate Compact for Adult 
Offender Supervision. He is also a member of the Bellevue Volunteer 
Fire Department and a graduate of the FBI National Academy.
  I thank Sheriff Davis for his longtime service to Sarpy County and 
the entire state of Nebraska.

RECOGNIZING MY STAFF ASSISTANT/LEGISLATIVE CORRESPONDENT, ERIN DAILEY, 
  FOR HER EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
                                DISTRICT

                                 ______

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Staff 
Assistant/Legislative Correspondent, Erin Dailey, for her work on 
behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional 
District. I could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
  Although she was born in Wisconsin, Erin was raised in Minnesota's 
Third Congressional District. After graduating from Armstrong High 
School, she attended Wesleyan University, where she played varsity 
soccer and received her degree in Government with a minor in Economics 
in 2023. Her experience studying abroad in Amman, Jordan, cemented her 
goal to move to Washington, D.C. after graduation and work in the 
public sector.
  After interning for my office in the fall of 2023, she returned full 
time as my Staff Assistant in February of 2024. Being a constituent 
herself, Erin has been a natural at making visitors to our office feel 
right at home when they walk through the front door. From organizing 
Donuts with Dean to assisting with D.C. tours, Erin has been a critical 
part of my mission of Radical Hospitality. Her recent promotion to 
Staff Assistant/Legislative Correspondent was an easy decision, as she 
has always been happy to handle constituent communications, even during 
the most challenging times in our office.
  Erin has been an amazing Staff Assistant that always keeps the trains 
running on time. She is full of life, vitality and positive energy. She 
is always looking to help the team and constituents make the best of 
their time in D.C. She practices the ethos of Radical Hospitality 
regularly to whoever she may meet. She always is learning and growing 
to broaden and develop her skill set even more. Hiring Erin was one of 
the best decisions we've made. As our final D.C. Staff Assistant, she 
is proof that sometimes the best is saved for last.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Erin all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for her 
year of faithful service to this Nation.

  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lewis W 
``Sparky'' Essex, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 92. 
A leader on all fronts, Lewis was dedicated to his family, his work, 
and his community.
  After graduating from Columbus High School, he attended Purdue 
University and Harvard Business School, and he served his country in 
the U.S. Navy in the Korean War. Lewis started in business at Golden 
Foundry, eventually serving as President for five years before founding 
his own company, Essex Castings, Inc. His compassionate leadership was 
unmatched, governed by wisdom and understanding.
  He was an active participant in his community, serving countless 
organizations, including as a member of the Purdue Board of Trustees, 
the Bartholomew County Hospital Board, and the Mayor's Advisory 
Committee, and as director of the Bartholomew County Red Cross, Rotary 
Club, and Columbus Chamber of Commerce.
  Lewis and his late wife Margaret left a legacy through their four 
children, Stephen, LuAnn, Michael, and Patricia; their fourteen 
grandchildren, and their fourteen great-grandchildren. As we remember 
Lewis, I'd like to thank them for sharing this servant leader with us 
and God bless her and family.

  RECOGNIZING THE 18TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF COLORADO

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JASON CROW

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of the 18th 
Judicial District Attorney's Office of Colorado, led currently by 
District Attorney John Kellner, and serving Arapahoe, Douglas, Elbert, 
and Lincoln Counties.
  In January 1962, the 18th Judicial District was established. 
Initially comprised of Arapahoe and Douglas Counties, Elbert County was 
added in 1965, followed by Lincoln County in 1969.
  The 18th Judicial District, with a geographic size larger than the 
state of Connecticut, has grown more than any other Colorado judicial 
district during that time and now has a population exceeding one 
million people. Within the next decade, Arapahoe County's population is 
expected to grow to be the most populous county in the state.
  In 2020, the Colorado General Assembly established a new judicial 
district. Next year, Douglas, Elbert and Lincoln Counties will form a 
newly created 23rd Judicial District, while Arapahoe County will be the 
sole county in the existing 18th Judicial District.
  Officials of the 18th Judicial District--prosecutors, victim witness 
specialists, support staff, and law enforcement officers--work hard 
every day to pursue justice, advocate for victims and support our 
community. As a Member of Congress, I look forward to continuing to 
work with our local law enforcement officials to promote public safety.

                        HONORING JAMES LOTT III

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
remarkable servant, Alderman James Lott III, a dedicated veteran, 
educator, and community leader, who has exemplified the spirit of 
service and commitment to uplifting others. Currently serving as the 
Alderman for Ward 6 in Clinton, Mississippi, James represents the 
city's only minority-majority ward with distinction and purpose.
  In his professional role as the Student Coordinator of Campus Culture 
and Diversity at Hinds Community College, James has been instrumental 
in fostering inclusivity and enhancing student success, particularly 
for underrepresented populations. His leadership extends beyond the 
classroom, as he strives to break down barriers and create 
opportunities for marginalized students to thrive in higher education.
  James' commitment to public service is deeply rooted in his diverse 
and impactful career. From inspiring and mentoring young minds as a 
high school teacher and coach to leading efforts as the Commander of 
the Hinds County COVID-19 Vaccine Site during the pandemic, his work 
has consistently made a tangible difference in the lives of those 
around him. His military service with the Mississippi Air National 
Guard further underscores his dedication to the community and country, 
where he was recognized as National Recruiter of the Year for his 
exemplary performance.
  As he works toward his Ph.D. in Urban Higher Education at Jackson 
State University, James is channeling his expertise into building 
pathways for student populations often left on the margins. This 
pursuit reflects his unyielding belief in the power of education as a 
tool for empowerment and progress.
  James' election as Alderman was powered by the very democratic 
principles, he passionately champions. He is a fervent advocate for 
civic engagement and voting, inspiring young people to understand and 
exercise the power of their voices at the polls.
  Today, I commend James Lott III for his enduring service, his 
visionary leadership, and

[[Page E1259]]

his tireless efforts to uplift his community and beyond. May his legacy 
of service continue to inspire us all.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Alderman 
James Lott III for his dedication and tenacity to serving his community 
and desire to be an example for all.

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the remarkable three 
decades that my constituent, Christine French Cully, served as an 
editor, editor in chief, executive vice president, chief purpose 
officer, and brand ambassador at Highlights for Children, Inc., as 
edited in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.
  Chris Cully contributed immeasurably to the success and growth of 
Highlights, as well as to the public esteem of the brand, by her wise 
decisions and extensive contributions to the Highlights editorial and 
business departments. She maintained the highest level of quality in 
her own work, serving as an advocate for children and keeping their 
best interests in mind throughout her career. She dedicated herself to 
helping millions of children become their best selves--curious, 
creative, caring, and confident--and personally answered thousands of 
their letters and emails, some of which have been compiled into her 
book, Dear Highlights: What Adults Can Learn from 75 Years of Letters 
and Conversations with Kids.
  Chris' foresight, vision, and deep understanding of the goals and 
philosophy of Highlights magazine helped her oversee the expansion of 
the way the company served children, reaching to include a wide range 
of communications realms, including digital formats, licensing 
partnerships, international initiatives, products to support parents 
and teachers, and a robust presence in other media, including podcasts 
and videos.
  Chris always labored to elevate and unify the children's publishing 
industry through her founding and hosting of annual retreats for 
magazine editors and through her personal and professional support of 
the Highlights Foundation and its workshops at the Chautauqua 
Institution as well as at its Boyds Mills campus. She also dedicated 
her time and energy in service to our region of the state through 
organizations such as Girl Scouts in the Heart of Pennsylvania, Habitat 
for Humanity, and St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.
  Time and time again, Chris proved herself to be a masterful 
participant at functions and events of import to the community. She 
gave speeches and workshops, and she was regularly interviewed for 
national news media. She truly lived her cause and commitment. I am 
proud to express my heartfelt appreciation for her life's work and 
enduring legacy.

               HONORING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS BERNARD CALVI

                                 ______

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to include in the record the obituary 
of Private First Class (PFC) Bernard Calvi of North Adams, 
Massachusetts. 82 years after he passed away as a prisoner of war in 
the Philippines, modern technology was finally able to identify his 
remains and return him home.
  As the family and community are finally able to honor PFC Calvi in 
North Adams, I want to personally offer my thanks for his service and 
sacrifice on behalf of a very grateful Nation.

                           PFC Calvi Obituary

       Private First Class Bernard Joseph Calvi, of the US Army 
     Air Forces, died on July 16, 1942 at the Cabanatuan Prisoner 
     of War Camp in the Philippines, where he was interned as a 
     Prisoner of War by Japanese forces during World War II. He 
     was born in North Adams on March 3, 1919, son of the late 
     Joseph and Lena (Cantone) Calvi. He attended North Adams 
     schools and graduated from Drury High School with the Class 
     of 1936. While at Drury, he was a standout member of the 
     Baseball and Football teams
       Pfc. Calvi entered the US Army on September 12, 1940, and 
     was serving with the 17th Pursuit Squadron, 24th Pursuit 
     Group of the Army Air Forces in the Philippines when the 
     United States entered World War II. During the battle for the 
     Philippines, he was wounded at least once but returned to 
     full duty as an Infantryman as there were no airplane's left 
     operational. When Bataan fell to Japanese forces in 1942, he 
     was taken prisoner and forced to take part in the infamous 
     65-mile Bataan Death March into captivity. After four months 
     of captivity in deplorable conditions, he succumbed to 
     Starvation, Malaria, and loss of hope. Following the efforts 
     of his family and the US Army over many decades, and with 
     advances in identification technology, Pfc. Calvi is finally 
     returning home, 82 years after his death.
       He is survived by his nephew, Bruce P. Calvi and his wife, 
     Joan (Titegens) Calvi, of Clarksburg; a cousin, Sylvia 
     Keehnle, of Pittsfield, great nieces and nephews, including 
     Springfield Fire Commissioner Bernard J. Calvi and his wife 
     Carrie of Springfield, Jennifer Belisle and her husband Bruce 
     of Stamford, VT and Jeffrey Calvi and his spouse Chris 
     Schaper of Bridgeport, CT; and great grandnephew and nieces 
     Elijah Calvi, Lucia Calvi, Ashlyn Belisle and Camryn Belisle. 
     He was predeceased by brothers and sisters-in-law, Raymond 
     Calvi and his wife, Pauline, Atty. Julius Calvi and his wife, 
     Mary Ann, and Joseph Calvi, who died in infancy.
       A Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Tuesday, December 10th 
     at 12 Noon in St. Elizabeth of Hungary Church, 70 Marshall 
     St. North Adams. Burial with full military honors will follow 
     in the family lot in Southview Cemetery, North Adams. A 
     calling hour will be held IN ST. ELIZABETH CHURCH on Tuesday 
     from 10:30 AM until 11:30 AM, directly before the Mass. The

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the life 
of Mr. Howard Chaim Tarlow. Mr. Tarlow, a resident of Edison, New 
Jersey, passed unexpectedly in his home following 16 years of valued 
service as a New Jersey Firefighter. It is my privilege to recognize 
Mr. Tarlow's life as an inspiring father of two girls and a son, who 
raised his family in Edison and gave back to the community as a 
dedicated member of distinction with the Edison Fire Department.
  Howard Tarlow was employed by the Edison Division of Fire, teaching a 
lifelong goal to be a career firefighter and give back to his 
community. This began in 2008, when he first joined the Highland Park 
volunteer the service. Two years later, Mr. Tarlow transferred to 
Raritan Engine Company 1 to courageously serve the community in which 
he and his family reside. Mr. Tarlow was known for his continuous 
pursuit of fire service education, regularly attending naming classes, 
and earning a Bachelors in Fire Science from New Jersey City 
University.
  The community is deeply saddened for the loss of Mr. Tarlow as they 
now miss a beloved friend, changemaker, and community leader. He will 
be remembered for his selflessness serving as a delegate for the Local 
1197 Professional Firefighters Association of NJ State (PFANJ) union, 
leading as Treasurer, charity account administrator, and team problem 
solver.
  Perhaps the most exemplary impact Mr. Tarlow brings to the Edison 
community is the inspiration he shared with his son, Mark (Mordy). In 
2020, Mark was appointed to be a member of the Edison Division of Fire, 
following in his father's footsteps. At age 47, Howard Tarlow is 
forever a valued community member, beloved father, and generous labor 
rights advocate for New Jersey firefighters.
  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in 
honoring Mr. Howard Tarlow for his lifetime dedication to his family 
and community.

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate Texas State 
Representative Tracy King. King has served in the Texas state 
legislature since 1995. We actually served together for a few years in 
Austin, Texas. I want to wish him well as he enters retirement.
  Representative King graduated from Carrizo Springs High School, 
Southwest Texas Junior College, and Texas A&M University where he 
earned his Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering.
  He spent his professional career providing hearing aids across south 
Texas and later sold his business to spend more time with his beloved 
family.
  He served his first term back in 1995 representing nearby Uvalde, 
Texas. In 2005, he was elected to represent the 80th House district, 
which covers much of my district--parts

[[Page E1260]]

of Webb County along with the entirety of Atascosa, Dimmit, Frio, 
Uvalde, and Zavala counties.
  Representative King has had a storied history in the Texas State 
House. Over the course of his fifteen terms, King has served as 
chairman of the committees on Border and International Affairs, 
Agriculture and Livestock, and Licensing and Administrative Procedures. 
He currently serves as the chair of the House Natural Resources 
Committee.
  King has also served as a member of the Board of Trustees for the 
First United Methodist Church and is a past president of the Kiwanis 
Club and the Texas Hearing Aid Association.
  I am proud to honor the career of this great public servant. South 
Texas owes him a great debt for his decades of hard work to improve the 
lives of all his constituents.

     URGING ACTION TO CONFRONT THE STILLBIRTH PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the 
stillbirth public health crisis, with over 21,000 stillbirths every 
year--almost 60 babies dying every day. At least one out of every four 
stillbirths is estimated to be preventable, but there is still too much 
we don't know. That's why we need real change that will lead to 
measurable improvements in outcomes for families.
  H.R. 5012, the Stillbirth Health Improvement and Education (SHINE) 
for Autumn Act I introduced with my colleague Rep. Young Kim, would 
improve data collection, invest in research and raise awareness of the 
causes and risk factors associated with stillbirth.
  I would like to include in the Record a link to the stories of more 
than 1,500 families impacted by the stillbirth crisis: <a href='https://
castor.house.gov/UploadedFiles/H'>https://
castor.house.gov/UploadedFiles/H</a>.R.-5012-SHINE-for-Autumn-Act-
Testimonies-1.pdf. I urge my colleagues to bring the SHINE for Autumn 
Act to the floor to confront this crisis and improve outcomes for 
mothers and babies.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MIKE ROGERS

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize the retirement of Tony Russell, the Superintendent of FEMA's 
Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston, Alabama.
  As Superintendent, Mr. Russell has provided executive level 
management and leadership for the CDP, which provides unique, hands-on 
training to more than 60,000 emergency responders a year from state, 
local, tribal and territorial agencies. He oversees operations of the 
CDP's 176-acre campus, which is home to the only training facility in 
the country where civilian responders can train in a toxic agent 
environment and the Nation's only hospital training facility dedicated 
solely to preparing the healthcare, public health and environmental 
health specialists for mass casualty events related to terrorism or 
natural disasters.
  Mr. Russell previously served as the Superintendent of FEMA's 
Emergency Management Institute. During his tenure at EMI, he was 
deployed in support of critical agency priorities. In 2012, Mr. Russell 
assisted with the Superstorm Sandy response and recovery activities in 
New York. In 2014, he was designated as the Acting Region VIII 
Administrator, serving as the Senior Executive for all FEMA priorities 
and requirements in the states of Colorado, Montana, South Dakota, 
North Dakota, Wyoming and Utah.
  In 2009, Mr. Russell was appointed by the President as the FEMA 
Region VI Regional Administrator and served in that capacity until 
2012. In this role, he was responsible for all FEMA operational 
decisions within the states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas 
and Louisiana.
  During 2003 and 2009, Mr. Russell served as a Federal Coordinating 
Officer for FEMA's Region VIII. In addition to his FCO duties, in 2009 
he assumed the role of Acting Director of the FEMA Louisiana Recovery 
Office for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike, with offices 
throughout the state. He also managed FEMA operations in many complex 
disaster response and recovery operations across the country, including 
potential hurricanes in Texas, the Pandemic Influenza Regional Team, 
and the agency's support to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in 
Denver, Colorado.
  Mr. Russell, a former United States Marine Corps Officer, holds an 
undergraduate degree in political science and management from the 
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. He earned two master's degrees 
from National University in San Diego in the areas of business 
administration (MBA) and management (MA). He also received a Master of 
Arts degree in Homeland Security studies from the Naval Postgraduate 
School, Monterey, California, and completed Executive Leadership 
Education at Harvard University.
  Mr. Russell is an active member of the emergency management 
community, including the International Association of Emergency 
Managers, and holds the designation of Certified Emergency Manager.
  Mr. Speaker, please Join me in recognizing this milestone for my 
friend, Tony Russell.

           HONORING PETTY OFFICER 2ND CLASS SHAKURYOR PEOPLES

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Petty Officer 2nd Class Shakuryor Peoples, a proud native of Vicksburg, 
Mississippi, who serves aboard the aircraft carrier, USS Ronald Reagan. 
Equipped with a full flight deck and more than 60 aircraft, including 
attack fighter jets and helicopters, aircraft carriers like the USS 
Ronald Reagan are among the largest warships in the world.
  Peoples graduated from Vicksburg High School in 2014 and joined the 
Navy 10 years ago. Today, he serves as a boatswain's mate. Reflecting 
on his decision to join the Navy, Peoples stated, ``I joined the Navy 
because I wanted to experience life. It allowed me to improve myself 
and experience the world.'' Peoples' service in the Navy is a 
continuation of the values instilled in him growing up in Vicksburg.
  Peoples serves in a Navy that operates forward, around the world, and 
around the clock, promoting the Nation's prosperity and security. 
During his service, Peoples has had many opportunities to achieve his 
personal and professional goals. Serving in the Navy has given him the 
chance to grow as a person and to aspire for greatness.
  Aircraft carriers have been the centerpiece of America's naval forces 
for more than 100 years, projecting power, sustaining sea control, 
bolstering deterrence, providing humanitarian assistance and disaster 
relief, and maintaining enduring commitments worldwide. Petty Officer 
2nd Class Shakuryor Peoples embodies the spirit of service, commitment, 
and leadership that our Navy stands for.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Petty Officer 
2nd Class Shakuryor Peoples for his dedicated service to our Nation.

                         LIBERTY IN LAUNDRY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7673, the 
Liberty in Laundry Act. This bill is the latest Republican attempt to 
manufacture a crisis and reject commonsense rulemaking from the 
Department of Energy.
  Mr. Speaker, why would we want less efficient washers and dryers? 
Americans want home appliances that are going to save them money on 
their energy and water bills. I learned this lesson well when I worked 
at Sears selling home appliances. The customers who I helped buy a new 
appliance would ask me about the energy efficiency of the new appliance 
they were considering and how it compared to the one they had at home. 
That is why I support the commonsense energy efficiency standards set 
by the Department of Energy. The Biden administrations' past and 
planned energy efficiency actions are estimated to save Americans $1 
trillion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.5 billion 
metric tons over the next thirty years.
  This bill would tie the hands of the Department of Energy (DOE) as 
they finalize and enforce efficiency standards for laundry machines. 
Contrary to the fearmongering of the Republican House majority, the 
Biden Administration did not create these rules to take away your home 
appliances. Congress mandates that DOE sets efficiency standards for 
appliances. The proposed rules would update twelve years old energy 
efficiency standard. The new standards were part of a consensus 
recommendation made by appliance manufacturers and efficiency 
advocates. H.R. 7673

[[Page E1261]]

would prohibit DOE from finalizing these new standards.
  With only six legislative days to go until temporary funding expires 
for the federal government, the House Republican majority has thus far 
failed to complete a spending package for Fiscal Year 2025. They also 
failed to act on the Farm Bill, which is now 14 months overdue. Yet, 
this week, the Republicans are wasting precious time considering a bill 
to ban energy efficiency standards for laundry machines. This is a 
disappointing, yet unsurprising, end to what has been a historically 
unproductive Congress. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7637 should be rejected. I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.

                          ____________________

                     HONORING SGT. GARNETT FRANKLIN

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
retired, tenacious, and self-motivated U.S. Army veteran, Sgt. Garnett 
T. Franklin. Sgt. Franklin enjoyed a long career in serving and 
teaching.
  Garnett T. Franklin was born and raised in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. 
He graduated from JFK High School in Mound Bayou in 1969. After high 
school, he enlisted in the Army, dedicated over two decades to serving 
in the U.S. Army Active Duty as a construction engineer. His military 
service offered many opportunities to serve at various Army bases and 
stations, such as Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 
Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Fort Benning, Georgia for Jump School. 
He also traveled to Japan, Korea, Belvoir, Germany, and participated in 
the Return of Forces to Europe. He retired at Fort Benning, Georgia in 
1993.
  After retiring, he relocated back to Mississippi and began teaching 
JROTC in Jackson Public Schools, Jackson, Mississippi, which included 
Murrah High and Lanier High School. Later, he returned to Belgium to 
join his family and worked with the Department of Defense in Washington 
State for 17 years as a fitness specialist at MWR.
  Upon returning home to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, he spends his time 
volunteering in the community and surrounding areas. He also volunteers 
with a male group of concerned citizens known as the Development 
Committee. This group started by cleaning up the grounds of a long-
standing local service station, cutting grass, pulling vines, and 
refurbishing an old neighborhood house. They also maintain the facility 
building and the Taborian Hospital grounds. Now known as the unofficial 
``beautification committee,'' this volunteer group takes pride in 
completing various projects around the city. As the holiday season 
approaches, they are preparing by putting up lights and decorations in 
the Milburn Crow Memorial Park and on the grounds of the Taborian 
Hospital for the entire city to visit and enjoy.
  Volunteering in his hometown allows him to give back to the community 
and enjoy the pleasures of retired life. Sgt. Franklin firmly believes 
that the military offers valuable pathways to personal and professional 
growth. His life's path has shown that the military is a great career 
starter.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sgt. 
Garnett T. Franklin for his passion for leadership, service and 
volunteerism to the United States of America.

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Leonard 
Lowinger on his 90th birthday.
  This month Leonard Lowinger--who normally goes by Lenny or Len--
turned 90 years old. Born on December 4, 1934, Len was raised in Mount 
Vernon, New York. Growing up he attended AB Davis High School where he 
played as a defensive guard and a kicker on the high school's football 
team. After graduating high school, Len enlisted in the United States 
Air Force where he served as a radar operator out of the Wadena Air 
Force Station in Minnesota during the Korean War. Len left the Air 
Force with the rank of Airman 2nd Class.
  After his time in the service, he met his soulmate, Harriet Robbie, 
and the two were married on September 21, 1957. They had three 
wonderful children--Marci, Jeff, and Judy.
  Len went into the dairy industry working for Belford Farms for forty 
years. When Len was not with his family or working, he filled his free 
time by bowling and playing golf. He also loved being a referee for 
high school football and basketball.
  Today, Len lives in Somerset, New Jersey in my congressional district 
where he is loved by his three children, ten grandchildren, and five 
great-grandchildren. Unfortunately, Harriet passed away in 2023 after 
65 wonderful years together.
  Most recently, Len was just elected the Resident Council President at 
his assisted living community The Bristal in Somerset--Congratulations.
  I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Len a happy and healthy 
birthday.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Deputy Chief Mike 
Shikany for his outstanding 31 years of service to the Bedford Police 
Department and to recognize his well-earned retirement.
  Deputy Chief Shikany devoted his career to ensuring the safety and 
well-being of our community, beginning his journey with the Bedford 
Police Department in October 1993 as a Police Officer, and through hard 
work and perseverance, rose through the ranks. From Police Corporal in 
2003, to Sergeant in 2008, Lieutenant in 2020, and ultimately to Deputy 
Chief in 2024, his leadership has been a guiding force for the 
department.
  Throughout his career, Deputy Chief Shikany has played a pivotal role 
in shaping the department's success, leading the Patrol and Criminal 
Investigations Divisions, and mentoring countless officers. His 
commitment to professional development is reflected in his bachelor's 
degree in criminal justice, the Master Peace Officer Certification from 
the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, and graduation from the 
prestigious Senior Management Institute for Police.
  Deputy Chief Shikany has earned numerous accolades, including 
Employee of the Quarter in 2014, a Certificate of Merit in 2013, and 
Patrol Divisional Employee of the Year in 2005. His career is further 
distinguished by numerous letters of commendation, each underscoring 
his exceptional dedication to law enforcement and the safety of our 
community.
  Deputy Chief Shikany's remarkable service has left a mark on the 
Bedford Police Department and improved the lives of the people he has 
served. I thank him for his tireless commitment in protecting North 
Texans. On behalf of a grateful community, I congratulate him on his 
retirement and wish him the best in this next chapter of his life.

              RECOGNIZING THE LAREDO DAYBREAK ROTARY CLUB

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. HENRY CUELLAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor forty years of the 
Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club. Their civic and community engagement has 
been a force in south Texas for decades, and I cannot wait to see what 
they can accomplish in the future.
  Founded in 1984, the Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club has kept a keen 
focus on the healthcare of the community. And that focus has produced 
incredible results.
  The club's first major initiative, helping Rotary International 
eradicate polio, raised more than 100 percent of their chapter goal. 
They then raised $125,000 to establish aerobic exercise courts on 
several school campuses across the district.
  Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club also put on annual screenings for 
glaucoma and assisted with Shots Across Texas. In districts like mine, 
such work is extremely important in promoting a healthy community. They 
are also involved in international health projects like building a 
clinic in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. I applaud them for it.
  I also want to take note of perhaps one of their greatest 
accomplishments. The Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club has presented $100,000 
for the endowment of Texas A&M International University and another 
$100,000 for Laredo Community College.
  These funds, which were raised by an annual raffle originally started 
to help eradicate

[[Page E1262]]

polio, are integral in promoting higher education in south Texas.
  The club also presents $1,000 scholarships each year to a graduating 
student from all eight of Laredo's high schools.
  Mr. Speaker, Laredo has been forever changed by the incredible work 
of our local Rotary organization. It's been an inspiring four decades: 
I look forward to their continued work in the local community.

                          ____________________

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the service of Mr. 
Steve E. Landin of Laredo, Texas. A lifelong civil servant, Mr. Landin 
has dedicated his career to the people of South Texas.
  He began his career with the City of Laredo in April 1990 and 
obtained an Associate's Degree in Fire Technology, as well as a 
Bachelor's Degree in Finance and Economics with an emphasis in Fire 
Administration.
  Over the course of his 30-year career with the City of Laredo, Mr. 
Landin served as Fire Chief and Emergency Management Coordinator for 
twelve years.
  He retired from the city in May 2020 and joined Webb County to serve 
as Emergency Management Coordinator for two years.
  Then, in August 2022, Mr. Landin rejoined the City of Laredo to serve 
as Assistant City Manager and Acting Chief of Police. In his role as an 
Assistant City Manager, he oversees more than ten different departments 
in his current role.
  This makes him one of only 22 people in American history to serve as 
both Police Chief and Fire Chief in their community.
  He's also giving his expertise back to the community. Mr. Landin is 
an instructor in rescue, EMS, Haz-Mat, Peace Officer, and Fire Service.
  He is also a Catholic Deacon. He serves the Diocese of Laredo at St 
Patrick Catholic Church in Laredo.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all dedicate ourselves to public service just as 
Mr. Landin has.

  RECOGNIZING MY LEGISLATIVE AIDE, CAROLINE KENNEY, FOR HER EXCELLENT 
       WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Legislative 
Aide, Caroline Kenney, for her work on behalf of every constituent in 
Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
  Caroline is a Minnesota native, hailing from the great city of 
Minneapolis. Upon graduating from DeLaSalle High School, she followed 
her ambition to Washington, DC, where she attended George Washington 
University. In 2022, she graduated Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree 
in political science.
  Starting in my office as an intern in her senior year of college, 
Caroline quickly stood out as an invaluable asset to the team. She 
envelopes and promotes Radical Hospitality, which made hiring her as 
Staff Assistant an easy choice. As a self-proclaimed animal lover, she 
took it upon herself to write a letter to the Smithsonian Zoo and 
Conservation Biology Institute about the future of the Giant Panda 
Program when its future was still an open question. This year Caroline 
was promoted to Legislative Aide, a position in which she has thrived, 
introducing multiple pieces of priority legislation including the Voter 
Choice Act and the Porch Pirates Act. She proudly embodies the 
Minnesota spirit and greets all who come to meet with her with warmth 
and a friendly smile.
  Staff and constituents alike know that Caroline is here for all the 
right reasons and is a tireless advocate for those without a platform. 
She's a pleasure to work with and our senior staff members certainly 
appreciated her keeping them updated on all the latest memes and pop 
culture trends. As an avid watcher of The West Wing, Caroline reflects 
that same good faith and passion in everything she does. Watching her 
grow from an intern to an accomplished legislative staffer has been an 
absolute joy.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Caroline all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for 
two years of faithful service to this Nation--and many more to come.

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the Bishop McDevitt 
Crusaders on their incredible State Football Championship victory on 
December 6, 2024.
  The Crusaders prevailed in hard-fought overtime against the Roman 
Catholic Cahillites at Cumberland Valley's Chapman Field. Crusaders' 
head coach Jeff Weachter and Quarterback Stone Saunders--bolstered by 
the Team's incredible endurance, discipline, focus, and skill--led the 
Team to their monumental victory.
  After the Crusaders were leading 14-3 at halftime, the Cahillites 
rallied to take the lead by 31-28 with just under 6 minutes left in the 
fourth quarter. The Crusaders then tied the game with a field goal 
before making a critical defensive stop and sending the game into 
overtime. After halting the Cahillites' offense one last time, the 
Crusaders found their way again into field goal position, where Kicker 
Aidan Grella solidified the Crusaders' championship--their second in 
only three years.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and privileged to recognize the Bishop 
McDevitt Crusaders Football Team on yet another State Championship 
victory, and wish them Godspeed in their individual and Team 
aspirations.

Scales-Preston for her decades of service to the House of 
Representatives as she departs to begin her new role as a Contra Costa

district to provide outstanding service to constituents.
  Shanelle has also shown unwavering devotion to her hometown of 
Pittsburg, California where she resides with her husband, Damon, and 
their sons Jaden and Ashton. She has served on Pittsburg City Council 
since 2018, working tirelessly to foster a strong and diverse community 
throughout the City. In this role, she has spearheaded efforts to 
expand access to affordable housing, improve public transportation, 
empower Pittsburg's youth, and build a vibrant hub in downtown 
Pittsburg. She has been a regional leader, working with a number of key 
groups and agencies, serving as the Chair of MCE and TransPlan and 
President of the League of California Cities East Bay Division. On top 
of it all, Shanelle is active with several community groups including 
the Gateway Rotary Club and Pittsburg Reads initiative.
  Shanelle was chosen by the voters to serve as the next Contra Costa 
County Supervisor for District 5. While I am sad to see her go from our 
team, I'm confident that in this role, she will continue to be an 
effective leader for our County. It has been a joy to work with 
Shanelle throughout the years and I'm incredibly grateful for her 
service.

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Norma Griffin.
  Norma was born in New York City where she was raised with her sister 
Rita. Norma

[[Page E1263]]

earned her B.A. from Hunter College and her M.A. from Teachers College 
at Columbia University. She married her husband, Ralph, in 1960 and the 
couple moved to California shortly after. The Griffins settled in 
Concord, California where they raised their two sons, Ralph and Steven.
  Throughout her life, Norma was deeply committed to her community and 
empowering young people. She was a devoted educator for over three 
decades, teaching in the New York public school system, Oakland Unified 
School District, Mt. Diablo Unified School District, and overseas in 
Japan and France. On top of her teaching, Norma was also dedicated to 
serving her community and was a leader in Contra Costa County. She was 
a founding member of the Black Families Association of Central Contra 
Costa County, a member of the Friends of the Concord Library, and 
served as president of the American Association of University Women's 
Concord Chapter. Norma received a number of accolades for her 
contributions, including the 1995 Mason McDuffie Teacher of the Year

  Norma was a multifaceted woman with many interests and hobbies. She 
was a talented musician and was a member of the Schola Cantorum of New 
York, Oakland Symphony Chorus, and a piano student at Julliard School 
of Music. She also enjoyed reading, crocheting, and traveling. She 
visited 36 out of 50 states and traveled to six continents.
  Sadly, Norma passed away, leaving behind her sons, niece Michelle 
Cambridge, cousin Joyce (Edwards) Palmer, longtime friend Cheryl 
Hazell-Small, and her godchildren Monique and Shadrick Small.
  Norma will be remembered for her courage, kindness, and 
determination. Please join me in honoring Norma Griffin.

           HONORING THE WELLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GREG LOPEZ

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Wellington High 
School football team for making it to the Colorado 2A State 
Championship game in only their third season with a record of 10-3. The 
town of roughly 12,000 residents last had a High School between 1926 
and 1964. Wellington Middle-High School opened in August of 2022, 
choosing to honor the previous school's colors and mascot, the Eagles.
  The combination of the players' determination and their coaches' 
admirable leadership throughout their playoff run culminated into a 
remarkable season. They are great examples of the extraordinary 
potential of the young people of Colorado.
  I thank the players for setting an example that will serve as an 
inspiration for future generations of high school athletes. They should 
all be extremely proud of what they have accomplished and know that 
this is just a precursor for the many great achievements each of them 
will have in their lifetimes.

   CONGRATULATING MR. JACK NANCE ON HIS RETIREMENT AFTER 32 YEARS AS 
         EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CAROLINAS GOLF ASSOCIATION

                                 ______

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Mr. Jack Nance, Executive Director of the Carolinas Golf Association 
(CGA) after 32 years of dedicated service in this role.
  Jack is a proud North Carolina native, he was born and raised in 
Clinton, North Carolina and attended high school and college in our 
great state. Jack is an avid golfer and has been a huge fan of the 
sport ever since his college days where he played golf at Wake Forrest 
and even served as the assistant coach for the golf team following his 
graduation.
  Throughout his tenure at the CGA, Jack has seen the organization grow 
to over 700 affiliated clubs that represent over 200,000 members. We 
will always appreciate the dedication Jack has shown to ensuring that 
golfers in the Carolinas have a great sporting experience and North 
Carolina maintains its reputation of the best state for golf.
  Jack has worked for the CGA since 1984 and has served as a rules 
official, communications point of contact and a course rater, before 
finally serving as Executive Director, a position he has held since 
1992. Jack even qualified for the 1980 US Amateur as a player. Nobody 
knows our courses quite like Jack and we will certainly miss his unique 
perspective.
  We know Jack is looking forward to being able to spend more time with 
his wife DeAnn and his two daughters Caroline and Liza. While we are 
sad to see Jack go, we wish him and his family the best as he begins 
this new and exciting chapter in his life.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Mr. Jack Nance on 
his well-earned retirement after 32 years of serving as the Executive 
Director for the CGA.

       RECOGNIZING KATHY MANNING, WILEY NICKEL, AND JEFF JACKSON

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Adams) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the distinguished 
service of three of my colleagues who will not be returning to this 
Chamber in January: Congresswoman Kathy Manning, representing North 
Carolina's Sixth Congressional District; Congressman Wiley Nickel, 
representing North Carolina's 13th Congressional District; and 
Congressman Jeff Jackson, representing North Carolina's 14th 
Congressional District.
  All three of these Members have served their respective districts 
with devotion, with courage, and with conviction.
  To my colleagues, I want them to know that it is a cruel injustice 
and a stain on the fabric of our democracy that we have to say goodbye 
to you today, but it is my privilege to highlight the good work that 
you have done here.
  To Representative Kathy Manning, who represents my hometown where I 
began my public service, I have appreciated our work together in the 
Greensboro community over the years and the most recent 4 years working 
on behalf of our community here in Congress. I was especially proud 
when she joined me to recognize the Greensboro Four earlier this year.
  She has been a great partner on the Education and the Workforce 
Committee. Whether it has been about fighting for equal pay or 
protecting women's rights or improving our schools and universities, I 
have admired her courage and commitment, and I thank her.
  To Representative Wiley Nickel, I have appreciated his knowledge and 
experience on the Financial Services Committee. He demonstrates why 
expertise in finance is necessary in the U.S. Congress. With Shaw 
University, an HBCU in his district, he has helped develop policy 
proposals that really dig deep into the root causes of inequity and 
addresses them at the source.
  Through the Supporting Diverse Entrepreneurs Act that we worked 
together on, students will be provided initial financing and expertise 
so young entrepreneurs can get to work starting businesses and growing 
our economy. I thank him. Our schools and young people are better for 
his service.
  To Representative, now attorney general-elect Jeff Jackson, it has 
been a joy to serve the people of Charlotte with him. We have delivered 
great community projects together, like Nourish Up's Hunger Hub to feed 
struggling families and The Umbrella Center, which will serve women and 
children who have experienced abuse. We can't forget the new main 
library for Mecklenburg County, which will provide a community center 
and access to books and critical services for years to come.
  We have worked on housing issues together, like the American 
Neighborhoods Protection Act, and he has been a great model in my Mad 
Hatter's Annual Luncheon.
  The people of North Carolina, Mr. Speaker, will be served well with 
our next attorney general, and we look forward to what he will 
accomplish.
  North Carolina and our Nation have been well served by these three 
Members, and it has been my privilege to work alongside each of them.
  Their seats were eliminated not by democracy but by the sinister 
forces of greed and corruption because of gerrymandering. There has 
been dangerous rhetoric in this Chamber about the sanctity and the 
validity of our elections, and I do want to acknowledge that while our 
elections are legitimate, that does not make them fair and it does not 
mean that our democracy is functioning as intended.
  I say to my colleagues, Representatives Manning, Nickel, and Jackson, 
I won't forget their service, and I won't forgive the process by which 
each of them has to leave this Chamber either.
  While they may have taken them out of this fight, I know the fight 
hasn't been taken out of each of them.
  Shirley Chisholm reminded us that service is the rent we pay for 
living on God's Earth.
  My thanks to each of them for keeping their rent fully paid up. God 
bless them as they move forward.

          RECOGNIZING 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF PENN STATE CREW TEAM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the 30th anniversary of the Pennsylvania State University crew team.
  This past Saturday, the team celebrated 30 years of commitment to the 
sport of rowing, the Penn State community, and continued excellence in 
the classroom.
  Chartered in December 1994 by Coaches Colin Upson and Mike Dugan, the 
Penn State crew team began with 28 members and a concerning absence of 
rowing equipment.
  Due to its lack of equipment and support, the team mainly trained on 
land, completing dry-land practices with the hope of a serious program 
guiding their efforts and passion.
  The program's first full year, starting in the fall of 1995, 
consisted of fundraising efforts to purchase equipment. From selling 
concessions at home football games and cleaning Beaver Stadium, an 
eight-person used wooden boat was purchased.
  In April of 1996, the team attended their first competition in 
Indianapolis where they joined the remainder of the Big Ten rowing 
teams at their conference championship.
  Throughout the following seasons, from 1996 to 1998, the team's 
membership increased to over 100 male and female members. Most of this 
group consisted of novice rowers with little experience in a boat or on 
the water.
  Expanded membership meant increased fundraising demands to keep up 
with the equipment needs. The large team numbers enabled the program to 
move into a bigger concession stand at Beaver Stadium, selling more 
clothing and food at all seven home games that season.
  Thanks to the team's tireless fundraising efforts, their boat was 
finally paid off. By 1999, the club's annual budget was nearly $35,000, 
with $30,000 coming directly from team members' service to the 
community and fundraising efforts.
  Over the following years, the program has swept podiums at national 
competitions and continues to excel both on the water and in the 
classroom.
  In the fall of 2006, the men's four-man boat's 4th place finish at 
Head Of The Charles and women's four-man boat's 2nd place finish 
highlighted a successful season in addition to a strong recruiting 
class for both the varsity and the novice teams.
  Thirty years later, the team is still committed to its original 
mission, following in the steps of its founders, Colin Upson and Mike 
Dugan.
  Today, the complete fleet of boats now rests on trailers behind 
Beaver Stadium, near the humble beginnings of service upon which this 
program was built.
  On any given day, you can find current team members waking up at 5:15 
to complete dry-land workouts like their founders did years ago.
  Thanks to the tireless efforts of its original members, the 
Pennsylvania State University crew team successfully maintains male and 
female competitive programs for novices, lightweights, and 
heavyweights.
  The team remains committed to creating boats capable of competing at 
the highest possible levels and strives to actively promote the sport 
of rowing within the Penn State and Pennsylvania communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize such an incredible program 
filled with so many passionate students and coaches. I congratulate 
them on 30 years and wish them the best of luck in their spring season 
as they continue representing the Pennsylvania State University, Penn 
State.

                 HAITIAN SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and speak on behalf of so 
many individuals, who do not have the ability to speak, to address a 
crisis in our hemisphere and a significant threat to American regional 
stability, our neighbor to the south and our ally from the inception of 
this country's birth, Haiti.
  The elected government of Haiti collapsed some time ago, leaving 
gangs in control of the capital and raining chaos down upon the Haitian 
people.
  Although Haiti holds the distinction of being the first republic of 
people of African descent and one of the oldest nations in the 
Americas, Haiti faces a significant and ongoing humanitarian crisis, 
overwhelmed by gangs that systematically endanger its democratic 
process.
  Don't be fooled that this does not affect the United States. The 
persistent failed state situation is an open opportunity for America's 
adversaries to destabilize the Caribbean region and undermine the 
security of neighboring nations. We are seeing the outlines of malign 
actors, including those with whom we are in global competition.

  Since President Jovenel Moise's assassination more than 3 years ago, 
gangs seized complete control, creating a humanitarian catastrophe that 
has left more than 12,000 people dead and forced nearly 800,000 from 
their homes. More than 5,000 people in Haiti have been killed by the 
gangs alone this year.
  Just last weekend, more than 180 people were killed in Haiti's 
capital, Port-au-Prince, as part of a multiday slaughter that was the 
result of a gang leader massacring older people and those he believed 
practiced Vodou as a personal vendetta to avenge his son's grave 
illness.
  Without immediate support, the crisis in Haiti will worsen, the 
criminal network will expand, and Americans will suffer the 
consequences.
  Haiti's Caribbean neighbors do not have the infrastructure or the 
capacity to accommodate this continued influx of refugees, which has 
seen hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants at their borders seeking 
a safer place to live.
  The Multinational Security Support Mission, led largely by officers 
from Kenya, has never received the support it needs to make an impact 
in the fight for the security and stability in Haiti. The mission is 
currently undermanned and underfunded. Many of our closest allies are 
not close to meeting their pledged obligations, nor have we in Congress 
given the resources that we said to advance the peace and prosperity of 
that nation.
  In particular, let me single out France. Where is France?
  Haiti has long suffered from the legacy of slavery and colonialism 
and the exploitation of resources by France. Upon winning a revolution, 
France, with our acquiescence, forced Haiti to pay $28 billion as a 
debt for their freedom and lost revenues from slavery. France enslaved 
and trafficked those people, extracted many mountains of wealth from 
Haiti, and kept taking from the Haitian people long after those people 
had achieved their personal emancipation and national freedom from the 
country of France.

                              {time}  1015

  The nation of Haiti, with its past, current, and ongoing humanitarian 
crises, is a testament to the tragedy of that wealth extraction.
  I urge our allies to join us in providing meaningful financial 
support, especially France, to advance stability and allow the people 
of Haiti to prosper. As I said earlier, the instability in Haiti is not 
only of humanitarian crisis, but a threat to our national security.
  Our adversaries have already set their sights on expanding their 
reach to the United States' third border in the Caribbean. The 
continued expansion of Russian and Chinese influence, as well as 
military support in the region, threatens our national security, our 
prosperity, and our democratic values.
  Depending on what Congress does or does not do will be what will 
happen to Haiti. The reauthorization of HOPE/HELP trade preference 
program will keep providing economic opportunities for Haiti.
  The apparel sector is one of the last formal sectors of Haiti's 
economy and represents nearly 80 percent of Haiti's exports. They used 
to have 60,000 jobs in this area which have now dropped to 25,000.
  Congress must act. We as Americans must act, if not just for the 
Haitian people, then for our own security.

                          DEFENDING OUR NATION

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act 
ensures our military focuses on its core mission: defending our Nation, 
not advancing a Green New Deal agenda. This year's NDAA puts an end to 
efforts that prioritize radical environmental policies over military 
readiness and national security.
  Key provisions include: No climate change programs. The NDAA does not 
authorize new climate change programs within the Department of Defense.
  Our Nation's mission is to deter and defeat threats, not to serve as 
a testing ground for expensive climate experiments.
  Zero-emission vehicle prohibition: The NDAA prevents the DOD from 
requiring servicemembers and civilian employees to use zero-emission 
vehicles for official travel. Although it might be usable in some 
phases, zero-emission vehicles can be impractical and unreliable, 
particularly in remote or high-stakes operational environments.
  The weapon system climate preference prohibition: The bill prohibits 
the Department of Defense from issuing rules that prioritize weapons 
systems based on their climate impact instead of their effectiveness in 
combat. Our troops deserve to have the best tools to win wars, not the 
most environmentally friendly ones.
  Defense industrial base greenhouse gas rules: The NDAA blocks the 
Department of Defense from implementing costly new greenhouse gas rules 
that would impose unnecessary burdens on the defense industrial base. 
These rules could stifle innovation, slow production, and drive up 
costs for critical defense equipment.
  The military's role is clear: protect and defend the American people. 
Anything that distracts from that mission puts our Nation at risk.
  Prioritizing climate regulations over combat readiness is a dangerous 
gamble, especially when global adversaries like China and Russia are 
laser focused on advancing their military capabilities.
  Pushing a Green New Deal through the Pentagon threatens to undermine 
our readiness, increase our costs, and weaken the defense industrial 
base at a time when strength is indeed paramount.
  Zero-emission vehicle mandates could leave servicemembers stranded or 
ill-equipped during missions. Climate-focused weapon system rules could 
mean our troops are outmatched on the battlefield because effectiveness 
took a back seat to some ideal of emissions.
  New greenhouse gas rules on defense contractors could drive small 
businesses out of the market, increasing dependence on foreign 
suppliers or a handful of very large ones. We cannot afford that risk 
to prevent innovation either.
  The NDAA reaffirms that national security comes first. It ensures the 
DOD uses its resources to strengthen our Armed Forces, not to chase 
political agendas.
  By blocking these unnecessary climate rules, we are maintaining a 
strong, focused, and effective military and not an idealistic goal.
  The NDAA draws a clear line: The Pentagon is not a climate agency. 
Every dollar and decision at the Department of Defense should 
prioritize mission success and national security.
  Our allies rely on it, and our people of this country rely on it. 
With this bill, we are safeguarding our military's readiness and 
ensuring that America remains the strongest force for peace and 
security in the world.

                       PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TARIFFS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Nickel) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the impact of 
President-elect Donald Trump's proposed 20 to 25 percent tariffs will 
have on raising costs for my constituents in North Carolina.
  I want to be absolutely clear. I find it ridiculous, shortsighted, 
and irresponsible to impose price hikes on working North Carolinians, 
and that is exactly what the Trump plan will do.
  To North Carolinians who are planning to build a home project with 
lumber and other materials: You can expect to pay a whole lot more. 
Remember to thank President-elect Donald Trump.
  To North Carolinians who want to pay to pack healthy school lunches 
for their kids: You can expect to pay a whole lot more. Remember to 
thank President-elect Trump.
  Congress has constitutional authority to raise and lower tariffs, but 
Trump's plan to circumvent Congress is what he would do, and he wants 
to do it himself.
  Why is he doing that?
  It is because he knows that if he asks Congress to pass a law, they 
would tell him that it was a terrible idea.
  I am here to get bipartisan work done, Mr. Speaker, and a 25 percent 
hike on tariffs would never get enough Republicans or Democrats on 
board to pass this Chamber. Trump will abuse his power to get what he 
wants. That is why I cosponsored the Prevent Tariff Abuse Act. I am 
pushing for this legislation to prevent the President-elect from 
abusing emergency powers to impose reckless tariffs.
  Mr. Speaker, 20 to 25 percent tariffs are little more than a national 
sales tax on working families across the country. North Carolina's 
working families can't afford that, and our country can't afford 
Trump's abuse of power.


                         civil nuclear exports

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, this week I am proud to have introduced the 
Civil Nuclear Export Act along with my colleague, Congressman  Jim 
Clyburn of South Carolina.
  Our bill will boost U.S. competitiveness in the global civil nuclear 
exports market and bolster U.S. national security.
  As Russia and China aim to corner the market and exert their 
influence around the world by financing nuclear projects, this 
legislation could not be more timely.
  That situation is intensifying rapidly, and it is time for the U.S. 
to step up.
  The Civil Nuclear Export Act would reduce other countries' dependence 
on Russia and China for technology and financing. This would be a win 
for our national security, a win for economic growth and more jobs, and 
a vital step toward a more sustainable energy future.


                        Hurricane Helene Relief

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because North Carolina working 
families deserve action from their elected leaders. They deserve action 
on needed relief for Hurricane Helene victims. They deserve action on 
lowered grocery costs, childcare costs, and healthcare costs. They 
deserve to have faith and trust in our government systems and to know 
that their leaders are acting in their best interest.
  Unfortunately, North Carolina Republicans in the general assembly are 
not acting in the best interest of North Carolina's working families. 
They are acting to consolidate their own power for personal gain. Under 
the guise of providing relief for Hurricane Helene victims, Republican 
leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly are using disaster aid 
as a smokescreen to push a brazen power grab.
  I am talking about North Carolina Senate Bill 382, a bill which 
weakens our democratic institutions and punishes voters for electing 
Democrats up and down the ballot in North Carolina.
  Despite needing $3.9 billion in the State of North Carolina for 
recovery funds outlined by Governor Cooper earlier this year, 
Republicans are sending just a fraction, 6 percent, of what is needed 
for western North Carolina. What is worse, buried in this 131-page bill 
are provisions designed to strip Governor-elect Josh Stein's control 
over our elections, to restrict Attorney General-elect Jeff Jackson's 
ability to fight to protect consumers and to create judicial positions 
to be handpicked by the legislature instead of elected by the people.
  They are rushing through this bill because North Carolinians just 
elected Democrats to those State offices. They are changing the rules 
to suit themselves, not the people of our State.
  My constituents in North Carolina sent me to Congress because they 
believe in bipartisan work. They want

[[Page H6806]]

legislators who work across the aisle to get things done. Until my term 
ends, I am doing everything I can to restore their trust in our 
systems, to stand up for them against rogue politicians, and to fight 
back against bills like SB 382.
  My constituents deserve better, and the American people deserve 
better.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President-elect.

                          ____________________

                        HONORING VELETER MAZYCK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Brown) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor an individual whose 
service, character, and dedication have left an indelible mark on this 
institution and the people it serves.
  I first met Veleter M.B. Mazyck in 2017 when I was selected to 
participate in the CBC Institute boot camp. I could not have known then 
that 4 years later Veleter would become not only my chief of staff but 
also a trusted adviser, confidante, and unwavering partner in serving 
the people of Ohio's 11th Congressional District.
  A steady hand who had served my predecessor for more than a decade, 
Veleter has been vital to the success of my office ever since.
  As she prepares to retire, I rise to recognize a career defined by 
integrity, selflessness, and an unwavering commitment to public 
service.
  Too often the contributions of congressional staff remain behind the 
scenes, unnoticed by the public but essential to our democracy. Far 
from the cameras, the House Chamber, or the committee dais, staff work 
long hours. They are driven by a deep and abiding sense of duty.
  Veleter Mazyck personifies this culturally, spiritually, and 
professionally. She is known for being both wise and witty, spontaneous 
and strategic, careful and kind, thoughtful and thorough, but, most 
importantly, a loving, loyal, steady, and steadfast steward of our 
Nation. She is a calm and commanding force behind every success.

                              {time}  1030

  Mr. Speaker, I rise to etch the name of Veleter Mazyck into the 
Congressional Record, ensuring her legacy endures for years to come.
  An unsung hero of this institution, Veleter committed herself to 
honing the skills and talents the Lord had blessed her with, to bending 
the moral arc of the universe a little bit closer to justice, and to 
ensuring our government serves its people with respect, dignity, and 
compassion.
  After a celebrated career as a general counsel to large metropolitan 
school districts, Veleter agreed to serve as Congresswoman Fudge's 
chief of staff for 1 year or maybe 2. Yet, a decade later, Veleter was 
still here, a cornerstone of the office, the Congress, and, dare I say, 
the country and the Constitution.
  Through her efforts, legislative priorities were championed with 
purpose and passion; crises were managed with character and charisma; 
and partnerships were forged, both publicly and privately, all with the 
goal of creating a better future for the people of Ohio's 11th 
Congressional District.
  Following my predecessor's appointment to President Joe Biden's 
Cabinet, Veleter skillfully managed the office during the transition, 
ensuring constituents continued to receive the support that they 
needed.
  Upon my swearing in, her wealth of experience and knowledge allowed 
me to competently step into my role. Ever since, Veleter's deep 
understanding of this institution has been invaluable.
  In moments of uncertainty, Veleter was the steady hand navigating 
challenges with poise and resolve. In moments of triumph, she didn't 
celebrate personal accolades but the victories achieved for the people 
of northeast Ohio. In every moment in between, she exemplified the 
highest standards of professionalism and dedication.
  What truly sets Veleter apart is her ability to bring out the best in 
those around her. Whether mentoring young staffers or building 
coalitions with colleagues, she led with patience, humility, and a 
genuine belief in the power of collaboration.
  After 13 years, the countless individuals she has impacted, from 
colleagues to constituents, are a testament to the lasting influence 
she has had on all who have worked with her.
  As Veleter steps away from Capitol Hill, I know that her 
contributions will continue to ripple outward. The legacy she leaves is 
one of progress, integrity, and hope.
  Veleter, throughout her career, has often spoken about the importance 
of getting off the dance floor. It was, as she says, her role as a 
leader to get to the balcony to see the bigger picture.
  As she retires, it is time to leave both the balcony and the dance 
floor behind. Now, the stage is hers to set. Whether it is traveling, 
writing, or pursuing new passions, retirement is her front-row seat to 
a life of her own design.
  I thank Veleter on behalf of a grateful Congress, a grateful 
district, and a grateful Nation. I thank her for her vision, virtue, 
and vigilance. We are better because of her sacrifice and for her 
unwavering commitment to see a nation not for what it was but for what 
it could be.
  We wish Veleter all the best in her well-earned retirement with full 
confidence that her impact on this institution and the Nation it serves 
will live on for generations to come.

            HONORING CLEMENCIA ESTEVIZ ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. De La Cruz) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly remarkable 
woman from Alamo, Texas, Clemencia Esteviz, who recently celebrated her 
100th birthday on November 22.
  From her early days at working in the fields to her dedicated service 
to the Diocese of Brownsville, Clemencia has lived a life filled with 
resilience, hard work, and unwavering devotion to her family and to 
others.
  Her family treasures the warmth that she brings to every Christmas 
gathering, where her tamale-making traditions have created many 
cherished memories for generations. She has extended her nurturing 
spirit beyond her immediate family, raising her niece's child as her 
own.
  I wish Clemencia a happy birthday and congratulate her on this 
incredible milestone.


                             Emergency Aid

  Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm for our 
farmers in south Texas and American food security. South Texas farmers 
are facing a crisis due to the Mexican Government's failure to honor 
its water obligations under the 1944 water treaty. This neglect has 
left over 960,000 acre-feet of water undelivered, devastating our 
agricultural sector.
  The Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers, after 50 years, has shut down, 
taking 500 American jobs with it. Our citrus and our vegetable farmers 
have seen millions in losses, and row crop yields are down 40 percent. 
Without immediate action, more livelihoods will be destroyed.
  Keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, food security is national security. That 
is why I have introduced H.R. 10113, the South Texas Agriculture 
Emergency Assistance Act. This bill provides $280 million in emergency 
aid to our farmers.
  Earlier in 2024, water was selling for around $300 per acre-foot. At 
that amount, the value of the water deficit is about $280 million, the 
amount we are requesting in emergency aid. This does not come close to 
equaling the losses to producers, but it is a starting point for funds 
needed to aid the region.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge leadership to include this legislation in any 
emergency aid bill that comes to the floor.
  Let's stand with our farmers and ensure that they have the resources 
to recover and thrive, which ultimately means American farmers feed 
American citizens and that we do not depend on foreign actors for our 
food.

                          ____________________

                        RECOGNIZING RYAN JARMULA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Pence) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and express my 
gratitude to a long-time trusted adviser for the Pence family.
  Ryan Jarmula, my chief of staff, has been a part of this team since 
the very

[[Page H6807]]

beginning. He counseled my brother, Michael, first, working with him in 
this body and then the Governor's office.
  President Trump saw his incredible value, leading to Ryan's service 
in the Trump-Pence administration Office of Speechwriting, in which he 
helped me in my term here. His future was limitless, but to my good 
fortune, Ryan agreed to join my team when I was elected to office.
  For years, he has been my eyes and ears in the district, giving my 
constituents the support that they deserved while I was here in 
Washington. From scheduling to communications to policy, Ryan can do it 
all.
  Despite Ryan's expertise, he is a humble man. He would never ask 
anyone to do something he isn't willing to do himself. A leader can 
only be respected to the extent he respects others, and Ryan 
exemplifies this principle. Our staff is successful because they are 
led by someone who sees their value, someone who supports them and 
wants the best for their future.
  I would not have been the legislator I am without his wise counsel, 
levelheadedness, and strong spirit.
  As we close this chapter in Congress, I am beyond grateful for Ryan, 
his beautiful family, and his friendship, and I look forward to 
watching his career unfold.
  Mr. Speaker, may God bless Ryan.


                      Recognizing Lani Czarniecki

  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of the most trusted 
advisers and a dear family friend of all the Pences. Since 2001, Lani 
Czarniecki has counseled the Pence family as the longest-serving Pence 
staffer.
  When my brother, Michael, started in the House of Representatives, he 
needed someone he could trust back in the district. He found that in 
Lani.
  When Michael returned to Indiana as Governor, Lani faithfully 
followed him to support our State. In the White House, Lani was one of 
the first people who Michael hired.
  I myself was blessed when Lani agreed to join my office, giving me 
aid and support in a way no one else could.

  Lani knows Indiana and service, but even more so, Lani knows people, 
and everybody knows Lani. He is a people person, someone who never 
meets a stranger. Always a calming presence in the room, everyone who 
meets Lani is immediately drawn to him. They see his kindness and 
character from the very first moment they meet him.
  Lani is a role model for what public service should be. Throughout my 
time in office, I have turned to his counsel time and time again, 
knowing that he will always tell me the truth.
  Indiana and this country are better because of Lani's work, and I am 
a better man because of Lani. I cannot thank him enough for his years 
of service, and I look forward to many more years of friendship to 
come.
  Mr. Speaker, may God bless Lani.


                        Recognizing Misty Hollis

  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a moment to honor a dear 
friend and public servant in Richmond, Indiana, and throughout the 
State of Indiana.
  Any Republican who seeks office in Indiana would do well to consider 
Misty Hollis' trusted counsel. In fact, Misty was one of the first 
calls I placed when I declared myself a candidate for this seat some 7 
years ago.
  Misty has long served as the Sixth District Republican chair and was 
named in 2015 as the Indiana Federation of Republican Women's Woman of 
the Year.
  Misty is the executive director and CEO of the Richmond Family YMCA, 
served two terms on the Richmond Common Council, and served in roles 
for Wayne County and Richmond Community Schools.
  Misty is a true public servant and role model for so many. She gives 
so much of her time, talent, and treasure to better her community. Even 
throughout her recent health struggles, Misty has always put others 
first. I cannot say enough how much we care for and admire Misty and 
her beloved husband, Tim.
  We thank them both for their friendship, and may God bless Misty 
Hollis.

          THE HONORABLE GRACE F. NAPOLITANO'S FAREWELL REMARKS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Napolitano) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in this Chamber one 
last time as a most humble Representative of the 31st District of 
California.
  Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly grateful to the people of San Gabriel 
Valley and southeastern Los Angeles County for the trust that they have 
placed in me for the last 26 years. It has been my distinct pleasure 
and honor to serve them and to work tirelessly with them on issues that 
directly impact our district and our region.
  Born in Brownsville, Texas, to an immigrant mother and a father from 
San Antonio, I have worked since the age of 12 for everything I have 
achieved. I was not expected to succeed with only a high school 
diploma. I believed in myself and was helped and mentored by so many 
people who believed in me.
  I have been extremely fortunate to have made so many dear friends in 
the House, and it has been a great joy to serve alongside them. Past 
and current colleagues from all walks of life have enriched this whole 
experience, been friends and family, and have helped me better serve my 
constituents.
  I especially thank my colleagues in the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Natural Resources 
Committee, Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Youth Challenge Caucus, 
and so many others. I thank them all for their partnership, mentorship, 
and collegiality.
  I express my gratitude to my extraordinary staff, most of whom have 
been with me for the majority of my time in Congress. I have the best 
staff in Washington. They are the most knowledgeable in water, 
transportation, and mental health, led by my wonderful chief of staff, 
Joe Sheehy, Jerry O'Donnell, Joseph Ciccone, Morgan Leonard, Sam 
Schiller, and Daniel Chao, my former chief of staff. They have always 
been accessible, polite, and helpful.
  I also thank my incredible staff on the Subcommittee of Water 
Resources and Environment, Ryan Seiger, Logan Ferree, and Alexa 
Williams, all in the gallery.
  In my district, my staff has always been in the community, meeting 
with residents, local agency staff, and volunteers to improve how the 
Federal Government services and invests in our community. They have 
dealt with hundreds of casework issues every year, getting veterans 
their proper benefits, Medicare recipients their proper care, and 
recent immigrants their proper status in the United States.
  They have been led by my district chief of staff, Perla Hernandez 
Trumkul, Elena Robles, Robert Pence, Carrie Lam, Leandra Berdin, Tracey 
Cooper-Harris, and Irma Elisheva Diaz.
  I thank my current staff and all previous staff in both offices for 
their service to our community and our Nation.
  I also thank the countless hardworking staff who make Congress run 
smoothly. These are the cafeteria workers, custodians, post office 
workers and letter carriers, and so many other employees of the AOC and 
CAO; the always-helpful Democratic Cloakroom staff; stenographers; 
employees of the Clerk, who always assist with legislative business; 
the friendly lady in the Lindy Boggs Reading Room; the incredible 
doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and medical staff in the Office 
of Attending Physician; the many brave Capitol Police officers, who 
protect us all; and so many others.
  Lastly, I am incredibly grateful for my remarkable, supportive, and 
loving family. Each and every one of them has provided the 
encouragement, guidance, and love that has sustained me through my 26 
years of Federal service and 13 years of prior State and local service.

  My husband, Frank, was my rock and my greatest encouragement.
  My children have taken care of many family obligations while I have 
been away in Washington.
  My beautiful grandchildren and 13 fabulous great-grandchildren have 
been my inspiration to make America a better place for future 
generations.
  I thank my son Fred and his family--his wife, Norma, and Freddie, 
Veronica, Elizabeth, Andrea, Niko, Nolan, Brooklyn, my first great-
great-grandchild on the way, and Daniel. I thank my son Edward and his 
family--Kelly, Bryan, Nathaniel, Scott, Nick, and Danielle; my son Mike 
and Lourdes; my daughter Cynthia and her husband, Curt, and

[[Page H6808]]

Jennifer, Tyler, Ethan, Emma Grace, Hayley Joan, Ryan, Jocelyn, Brenna, 
Kinsley, and a great-grandson arriving soon; Dillon and Chelsey; my 
beloved late daughter's family, Christopher, Karina, Christopher Jr., 
Grayson, Michael, and Dominic.
  I thank them all for supporting my service and supporting me 
throughout my career. I am so very proud of them all.
  Once again, I am proud of everything we have accomplished together 
throughout my tenure.
  I also thank my constituents for trusting in me to be their 
Representative. As I have said to both Republican and Democratic 
Presidents alike, my focus has been representing my district first, 
State second, and Nation third.
  I will continue fighting for the San Gabriel Valley through my last 
day in office.
  I wish everybody a merry Christmas, a joyous holy season, and much 
health and happiness in the New Year and beyond. May God bless 
everybody in this House and those who serve in it.

              RECOGNIZING CHIEF WILLIAM C. ``BILL'' MOBLEY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in this hallowed House of our 
Nation's Capitol to recognize and honor a man who has served his 
community well for a long period of time, Chief William ``Bill'' 
Mobley, a remarkable individual whose lifetime of service and 
dedication to his community, his State, and his country have earned him 
the great honor of being inducted into the South Carolina Law 
Enforcement Officers Hall of Fame.
  This agency was formed back in 1797, and it exists today in 2024. In 
227 years, only 400 people have met the standards to be inducted into 
the Hall of Fame in South Carolina.
  Chief Mobley's career is a testament to his unwavering commitment to 
justice and public service. A graduate of the University of South 
Carolina, Chief Mobley distinguished himself early in his law 
enforcement career, earning the JP Strom Award from the South Carolina 
Criminal Justice Academy. This recognition is reserved for the very 
best, and Chief Mobley embodied this excellence throughout his 43-year 
tenure with the York Police Department. From 2000 until his retirement 
in 2010, he served as chief of police, leading with integrity, 
professionalism, and a steadfast commitment to protecting the citizens 
of York.

                              {time}  1045

  Chief Mobley's public service extended beyond his work in law 
enforcement. For 18 years, he volunteered with the York Rescue Squad 
and York Fire Department, demonstrating a willingness to serve whenever 
and wherever his community needed him the most.
  His professional affiliations, including the South Carolina Law 
Enforcement Association, the South Carolina Police Chiefs Association, 
and the York County Fraternal Order of Police, reflect his longtime 
dedication to advancing the law enforcement profession and mentoring 
those who followed in his footsteps.
  Chief Mobley's sense of duty began long before his career in law 
enforcement. He proudly served his country in the United States Marine 
Corps from 1964 to 1970 where he achieved the rank of lance corporal. 
His commitment to the ideals of service, sacrifice, and leadership that 
define the Marine Corps carried over into every aspect of his life.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Chief Mobley has been a 
pillar of his community. He has served as president of the Clover 
Optimist Club, coached Dixie League youth baseball for over 20 years, 
and he has contributed to organizations such as the Catawba Bow Hunters 
Club, the National Rifle Association, and the VFW Post 66. He is a man 
of deep faith, and he is also a devoted member of the Union Baptist 
Church.
  Chief Mobley's life of service is even more extraordinary by the 
unwavering support of his loving wife, Emily. They have been married 
since 1966.
  Together, they have raised four daughters, instilling in their family 
the same values of faith, service, and community that has defined Chief 
Mobley's life.
  Chief Mobley represents the very best of South Carolina. His 
introduction into the South Carolina Law Enforcement Officers Hall of 
Fame is a fitting tribute to a life lived in service to others. His 
legacy of leadership, compassion, and commitment to justice has and 
will continue to inspire generations to come.
  On behalf of the people of South Carolina's Fifth Congressional 
District, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Chief Mobley on this 
well-deserved honor. May his remarkable achievements remind all of us 
the difference one dedicated individual can make.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will join me in saying a big thank you 
to Chief Mobley.

      HOLDING THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO A HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARD

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Casten) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, last week the Speaker of the House and the 
majority leader said that the report into serious allegations of 
misconduct by former Representative Matt Gaetz was ``moot'' because he 
had resigned from Congress.
  I rise today to remind my colleagues of four names and 4 years: 1987, 
Bill Boner; 1990, Don Lukens; 2006, Mark Foley; 2011, Eric Massa.
  Those are four Members of Congress, spanning each of the last four 
decades: two Democrats, two Republicans. All four of them resigned from 
their seats while under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. 
Allegations against these Members included acceptance of bribes; 
sharing inappropriate, sexually explicit images; and sex with a minor 
child.
  In all of those cases, the work of the Ethics Committee continued 
even after their resignation. In three of the four cases, the report of 
the Ethics Committee was released to the public.
  In none of those cases did anyone have the gall to declare those 
reports to be moot.
  Now, in 2024, another Representative has resigned while he was under 
investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations, including 
acceptance of bribes; sharing of inappropriate, sexually explicit 
images; and sex with a minor child. Mr. Gaetz is also alleged to have 
engaged in illicit drug use.
  We all understand that even the allegation of such activities being 
committed by one of us cheapens this whole institution. We also all 
respect the traditions of this House. While they may sometimes need 
reform, we tread carefully before setting any new precedents.
  We find ourselves with a tradition going back at least four decades 
that Members of the House who are under investigation by the Ethics 
Committee for these sorts of allegations cannot prevent that 
information from becoming public simply by resigning from their seat, 
yet that is exactly the precedent that the majority voted to upend last 
week when they voted to kill the resolution to compel the release of 
the Ethics Committee report on Mr. Gaetz.
  Every Member of this body now needs to ask themselves if they believe 
that the precedent of this House holding itself and its Members to a 
higher ethical standard is one worth keeping.
  They need to ask themselves if they believe that even if you resign 
from this body, future employers, whether in the public or private 
sector, should know if you can be trusted to represent their 
institutions with dignity and honor, can be trusted with their 
financial resources, can be trusted around underage children.
  Make no mistake: Everyone who voted against the release of the report 
last week was saying that, no, the time has come for a new precedent 
where the rules no longer apply to us; where from this day forth, the 
Republican majority shall loudly proclaim: What happens in D.C. stays 
in D.C.
  As our friend and former colleague Elijah Cummings would have 
reminded us, we are better than this.
  Upholding precedents and maintaining the integrity of this House is 
not moot.

            RECOGNIZING THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF CARTER NICELY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Cline) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courageous actions 
of 16-year-old Carter Nicely from Alleghany County who heroically saved 
the lives of his family as their home was engulfed in flames earlier 
this year.
  As dawn broke, Carter was awakened by an extraordinary heat. 
Attempting to turn on his bedside lamp, he quickly realized the 
electricity was out. Without hesitation, he sprang into action, rushing 
to warn his parents, Anthony and Kristin Nicely, and his younger 
brother, Brody, of the imminent danger.
  Thanks to Carter's swift actions, his family was able to evacuate 
their home safely, though they tragically lost everything in the fire.
  In recognition of his bravery, the Sharon Fire and Rescue team 
awarded Carter a lifesaving award, a commendation they have only 
bestowed once before.
  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, congratulate Carter Nicely on his quick 
thinking and decisive action which undoubtedly saved lives.


     Celebrating Strasburg Presbyterian Church's 200th Anniversary

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Strasburg 
Presbyterian Church as it proudly celebrates 200 years of service.
  The church was founded in 1824 by a small, dedicated group of 
Christians under the leadership of Reverend Dr. William Henry Foote, a 
Princeton graduate who came to the Shenandoah Valley to provide English 
language services for residents primarily speaking German.
  Notably, Strasburg Presbyterian is the only church in town to 
withstand the Civil War, even serving as a hospital for wounded 
Confederate and Union soldiers after the pivotal battles of Cedar Creek 
and Fisher's Hill.
  Today, under the guidance of Reverend David Howard, the church goes 
beyond traditional worship and Sunday school. It actively participates 
in community initiatives such as blood drives, Bible studies, pancake 
breakfasts, and spaghetti dinners.
  With 90 active members, many of whom are multigenerational families, 
Reverend Howard envisions a bright future for the church, embodying the 
spirit of community service with the belief that ``it is about putting 
your community before yourself.''
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Strasburg Presbyterian Church for its 
unwavering commitment to service and hope the church continues to bless 
our community for another 200 years.


            Celebrating the Roanoke Star's 75th Anniversary

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a beacon of hope 
and community pride in my district: the Roanoke Star. It was on the eve 
of Thanksgiving in 1949 at exactly 8:22 p.m. when a star was 
illuminated for the first time atop the most prominent mountain in the 
heart of the city of Roanoke, Virginia.
  What began as a Christmas decoration, this man-made metal star has 
now become an enduring symbol of our community spirit for 75 glorious 
years.
  Built by Roy Kinsey of the Kinsey Sign Company for $28,000, this 
impressive structure towers 88.5 feet tall, proudly visible from as far 
away as 60 miles. With 2,000 feet of neon tubing ready to shine in red, 
white, and blue, the Roanoke Star is not just any star; it is the 
largest freestanding illuminated star in the world.
  Visitors come from countless places to witness this treasured 
landmark, take in the breathtaking view of the Roanoke Valley, explore 
scenic trails, or enjoy the nearby Mill Mountain Zoo. The Roanoke Star 
is recognized on both the National Register of Historic Places and the 
Virginia Landmarks Register, reminding us of our heritage and 
commitment to preserving our history.
  As we mark this 75th anniversary, let us celebrate the Roanoke Star's 
significance in Virginia's Sixth District, and may it continue to shine 
as a welcoming beacon for all who visit.

   RECOGNIZING EDUCATORS IN THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Meuser). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Lee Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, as a former first grade teacher in 
Houston, I rise to honor remarkable educators from school districts in 
the 18th Congressional District of Texas whose dedication and impact 
inspires students and strengthens our community.
  The Aldine Independent School District, led by Dr. LaTonya M. 
Goffney, serves over 67,000 students.
  Amanda Lee is the Elementary Teacher of the Year from Carmichael 
Elementary. She fosters hands-on learning in an environment where every 
child is empowered to succeed.
  Leticia Vargas is the Secondary Teacher of the Year from Davis High 
School and engages students with culturally relevant lessons and 
provides vital mentorship.
  Rosalind Burns is the Principal of the Year from Jones Primary and 
has transformed her school with innovative programs and enhanced 
student engagement and achievement.
  Next, from the Houston Independent School District, of which I am a 
proud graduate, our largest district in the 18th District, is Jasmine 
Campbell, a leader in digital tools and classroom collaboration. She 
empowers her students and peers through mentorship and innovation.
  Alondra Lachney Mejia, a special education teacher, tirelessly 
supports students with unique differences to help them overcome 
challenges.
  Yusheba Moses is the counseling manager, and she has devoted 20 years 
to guiding students and counselors, driving positive change across the 
district. She reminds me a lot of my favorite guidance counselor, 
Felicia Doyle, who invested in me when I was in high school.
  From the Humble Independent School District that serves 48,000 
students, we have Camron Bradford, the Secondary Teacher of the Year at 
Summer Creek High School, who supports student well-being with 
compassionate lessons like ``it is okay to not be okay.''
  Jasmine Thomas, the Elementary School Teacher of the Year at Autumn 
Creek Elementary, creates a kind and inclusive classroom with 
imaginative storytelling.
  James Linse, a special education teacher at Lakeland Elementary, 
connects lessons to real-world scenarios, empowering his students.
  From the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District, which is led 
by superintendent Dr. Douglas Killian and serves over 118,000 students, 
we have London Martin. London is a fifth-grade teacher at Francone 
Elementary, who achieved 100 percent participation in a district math 
program by fostering strong relationships with her students.
  Jasmine Bookman, a sixth-grade math teacher at Campbell Middle 
School, inspires growth through her dedication to academic and personal 
development.
  William ``Frank'' Patterson, a Navy veteran at the Carpenter Center, 
uplifts students with his unwavering support and generosity, including 
home-cooked meals.
  The Spring Independent School District, led by Dr. Lupita Hinojosa, 
serves over 33,000 students and just this past Monday, renamed its 
Family and Community Engagement Center after my mother, the Honorable 
Sheila Jackson Lee.
  I salute Rosemary Perez, a bilingual teacher at Donna Lewis 
Elementary, who uses innovative strategies to foster growth in her 
bilingual students.
  Dr. Clara Thompson, who is a college counselor at Westfield High 
School, has guided countless students, including many first generation, 
to success over her 31-year career.
  Scott Sims, a government teacher at Westfield High School, enriches 
his students' learning with his background in community service and 
support for many extracurriculars.
  These educators remind us that teaching is not just a profession but 
a calling to shape future generations. Their unwavering commitment to 
excellence deserves our gratitude and continued support.
  I commit my full support to policies that help close the achievement 
gap, support teachers, principals, and students, and help our public 
schools address 21st century needs.

[[Page H6810]]

  Let us not go back to suppressing freedom of speech and ideas that 
help our schools remain true centers of learning.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank these educators for their tireless dedication to 
our children and communities to truly make America the best place to 
be.

                     AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this Congress is about to vote to pass 
another obscene military budget when the Pentagon just failed its 
seventh audit in a row. That is nearly a trillion dollars going to 
weapons and war.
  When it comes to the Pentagon budget, not a single one of my 
colleagues asks: How are we going to pay for it?
  Why is it, then, when it comes to addressing critical issues here 
like hunger, poverty, our broken healthcare system, or clean water, 
they tell me that we don't have the money.
  However, even more disturbing for many of my residents and the 
American people is that many of my colleagues in this Chamber are 
profiting personally, financially when they vote to pass more funding 
for war.
  I introduced the Stop Politicians Profiting from War Act, which bans 
Members of Congress and their families from owning defense stocks. My 
colleagues should not be able to use their positions of power to get 
rich from defense contractors while voting to pass more funding for 
war. Our elected officials should not be able to profit off of death. 
The American people deserve better.


                          Fight Against Hunger

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this holiday season, too many of our children 
are going to bed hungry while colleagues vote to pass nearly a trillion 
dollars for war. In the richest country in the world, millions of our 
children live in poverty, lacking access to necessities like food, 
shelter, and healthcare.
  More than 44 million people across our Nation face hunger, including 
15 percent in our Wayne County community in the 12th Congressional 
District.
  SNAP is a key tool in combating hunger. It has been very successful 
in helping vulnerable communities like ours, and it remains the most 
vital line of defense against hunger. However, many of my Republican 
colleagues want to continue to cut this essential program.
  We must protect and expand the social safety net and increase funding 
for SNAP and other programs to combat hunger. Working families in our 
country should not have to worry about where their next meal is coming 
from. Children cannot learn, Mr. Speaker, when they are hungry.
  By investing in universal school meals, we can ensure every child has 
access to resources needed to thrive at school. SNAP families only 
receive an average of about $6 a day per person. That is it. We must 
not only protect this incredibly important food assistance program, but 
expand it to make sure it actually covers the growing cost of 
groceries.
  We know that our families are getting price gouged every single day 
at the grocery store. If this body has money for endless wars, we must 
surely find the resources to end child hunger in our country.


                      Amnesty International Report

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I will read into the Record something from a 
recent report. It said: ``Israel has forcibly displaced 90 percent of 
Gaza's 2.2 million inhabitants, many of them multiple times, into ever-
shrinking, ever-changing pockets of land that lacked basic 
infrastructure, forcing people to live in conditions that exposed them 
to slow and calculated death. It has deliberately obstructed or denied 
the import and delivery of lifesaving goods and humanitarian aid. It 
has restricted power supplies that, together with damage and 
destruction, led to the collapse of the water, sanitation, and 
healthcare systems.''
  Mr. Speaker, I just quoted from Amnesty International's 296-page 
report concluding that Israel's Government is committing genocide 
against Palestinians in Gaza, as defined in international law by the 
Genocide Convention.
  Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record a hyperlink to Amnesty 
International's `` `You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel's Genocide 
Against Palestinians in Gaza.'' This report confirms what we have known 
for months. My colleagues can no longer deny this is genocide.
  The hyperlink is: Https://<a href='http://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/8668/
2024/en'>www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/8668/

RECOGNIZING OFFICERS IN THE ALTOONA POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THEIR CAPTURE 
                           OF LUIGI MANGIONE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DesJarlais). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
officers of the Altoona Police Department for their professionalism, 
their bravery, and their quick response that led to the arrest and the 
capture of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of 
UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson.
  When a call came from the McDonald's restaurant on Plank Road in 
Altoona, Officers Tyler Frye and Joseph Detwiler immediately moved into 
action, working quickly to apprehend the suspect before he could flee. 
It was their questioning and their police work that ultimately led to 
his arrest, putting to rest a national manhunt.
  With only 6 months on the job, Officer Tyler Frye's career is off to 
a significant start, and I am grateful to him and for all 66 officers 
of the Altoona Police Department that is led by Chief of Police, Joe 
Merrill.

                              {time}  1100

  While high-profile, this arrest is just a small part of the 
incredible work that these officers do each and every day to protect 
the community.
  Whether it is patrolling our streets, working to stop the flow of 
fentanyl and other illicit drugs into our communities, or doing 
outreach at our schools, the officers of the Altoona Police Department 
are a strong example of what is best about our community.
  On behalf of everyone in Blair County and throughout Pennsylvania's 
13th Congressional District, I thank the officers of the Altoona Police 
Department for their commitment to protect and serve the community.

                          ____________________

                  NDAA REFLECTS REPUBLICAN PRIORITIES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, today I--I think we will--rise in strong 
support for the fiscal year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, 
known as the NDAA.
  The world, Mr. Speaker, is an increasingly dangerous place, and the 
threats we are facing continue to evolve. Over the past 4 years, we 
have witnessed Ukraine under siege, Taiwan under constant pressure from 
China, and on that fateful day, October 7, Israel was attacked--
devastated, massacred, brutalized--by Iran and its proxies, and they 
responded. We have also witnessed the persistent threat of terrorism, 
Mr. Speaker, in Africa and the drug cartels creating continued danger 
and death closer to home.
  These are not just far-off challenges, Mr. Speaker. They directly 
impact our national security, economic stability around the world, and 
the safety of the American people.
  This bill is about making the necessary investments to ensure that 
the United States remains the most powerful military in the world. It 
supports our troops and ensures they have the resources they need to 
carry out their missions safely and effectively. It provides for 
weapons upgrades, the development of cutting-edge technologies, and 
revitalization of the defense industrial base, ensuring our readiness 
to face all adversaries.
  Too often, we hear stories of military families struggling to make 
ends meet, and that is simply unacceptable. This bill takes a stand for 
them, providing better pay and support so that no servicemember ever 
has to rely upon food stamps to feed their family.
  Let's address those who oppose this bill because it doesn't include 
more social engineering or ideological experiments. The United States 
military is not a social engineering experiment. It

[[Page H6811]]

is a fighting force designed to protect our Nation and ensure global 
stability.
  The American people as well should be confident that with Pete 
Hegseth, President Trump's pick for Secretary of Defense, at the helm 
we can trust that the Department of Defense will prioritize ending 
divisive ideologies and enhancing military readiness.
  As well, there are some who argue we could cut more from defense 
spending. This bill represents a modest 1 percent increase over last 
year's budget, but it is a critical investment in our safety and 
future.
  Do we need more efficiency measures? Yes, we DOGE.
  Next year, with the new administration, we will make our defense 
spending leaner, sharper, and more effective and always putting America 
first.
  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about prioritizing what truly 
matters: military readiness, modernization, and the security of the 
American people rather than a social and ideological agenda.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill and in 
supporting our troops.


                 2025 NDAA Delivers Critical Resources

  Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, supporting our servicemembers and their 
families is absolutely essential to ensuring our military readiness and 
ensuring the United States has the greatest fighting force in the 
world. That is why I and many are urging all our colleagues to support 
the NDAA, which we will be voting on tonight, which prioritizes the 
well-being of those who defend our freedom.
  This bill delivers critical resources: improved housing through 
investments aimed at upgrading military facilities, better health 
coverage for servicemembers and their families, expanded accessibility 
of childcare and enhanced support for military spouses, including 
professional licensing portability programs.
  It also authorizes a significant pay raise for servicemembers, with a 
14.5 percent increase for junior enlisted personnel and a 4.5 percent 
for all other ranks. This will provide the recognition and compensation 
they have earned and deserve. As well, this legislation tackles 
pressing challenges facing our Nation, strengthens our southern border 
by allocating funding for advanced surveillance technology and 
additional personnel, counters rising aggression from China by 
supporting increased funding for Indo-Pacific defense initiatives, and 
reaffirms our unwavering commitment to Israel by authorizing continued 
funding for missile defense systems like the Iron Dome.
  House Republicans are committed to cutting wasteful spending, 
slashing the so-called military bureaucracy, and standing with those 
who fight for our country. This NDAA reflects that commitment by 
ensuring our Armed Forces have the resources they need, whether on the 
front lines or here at home.
  By passing this bill, we are making sure our military is prepared to 
meet today's challenges while safeguarding the freedoms of tomorrow.

                        HONORING NIKKI GIOVANNI

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. McClellan) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker:

     I was born in the congo
     I walked to the fertile crescent and built the sphinx
     I designed a pyramid so tough that a star that only glows 
           every one hundred years falls into the center giving 
           divine perfect light
     I am bad

     I sat on the throne drinking nectar with allah
     I got hot and sent an ice age to europe to cool my thirst
     My oldest daughter is Nefertiti the tears from my birth pains 
           created the nile
     I am a beautiful woman

     I gazed on the forest and burned out the sahara desert with a 
           packet of goat's meat and a change of clothes
     I crossed it in two hours
     I am a gazelle so swift so swift you can't catch me

     For a birthday present when he was three I gave my son 
           hannibal an elephant
     He gave me rome for mother's day
     My strength flows ever on

     My son noah built new/ark and I stood proudly at the helm as 
           we sailed on a soft summer day

     I turned myself into myself and was jesus
     men intone my loving name

     All praises All praises
     I am the one who would save

     I sowed diamonds in my back yard
     My bowels deliver uranium the filings from my fingernails are 
           semi-precious jewels
     On a trip north
     I caught a cold and blew
     My nose giving oil to the arab world
     I am so hip even my errors are correct
     I sailed west to reach east and had to round off the earth as 
           I went
     The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid across three 
           continents

     I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
     I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

     I mean . . . I . . . can fly like a bird in the sky . . .

  Mr. Speaker, this poem, ``ego-tripping,'' sparked my interest as a 
child, growing up in the South from my favorite poet, Nikki Giovanni, 
who passed earlier this week.
  Nikki was one of the leading voices of the 1960s Black arts movement, 
with one writer naming her the ``poet of the Black revolution.'' Her 
work focused on race, gender, politics, love, and joy. Through poetry, 
children and nonfiction books, and spoken word albums, she celebrated 
Black America and Black liberation. As a young girl, I could see myself 
reflected in her work.
  She dedicated herself to uplifting and empowering other Black women 
writers, publishing an anthology of poetry written by Black women.
  Nikki was a fierce voting rights advocate and fought to ensure 
everyone could make their voices heard at the ballot box.
  She taught at several universities, culminating for 35 years at 
Virginia Tech, where she retired in 2022 as a distinguished professor 
of English. She received countless awards and accolades and was a 
groundbreaking literary giant.
  When the Virginia Tech community mourned the lives of 32 people 
killed by a gunman in 2007, she honored them with a poem entitled, ``We 
are Virginia Tech,'' in which she said:

     We are sad today, and we will be sad for quite a while.
     We are not moving on, we are embracing our mourning.
     We are strong enough to stand tall tearlessly, we are brave 
           enough to bend to cry, and we are sad enough to know 
           that we must laugh again.

  Nikki Giovanni has flown away home, and we will be sad for quite a 
while, but her words leave a lasting legacy that will continue to 
inspire generations to come.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL HOWARD BRADLEY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
Daniel Howard Bradley of Savannah, Georgia.
  Mr. Bradley sadly passed away on December 3 in the presence of his 
family. Born at the old Telfair Hospital in Savannah, Mr. Bradley was a 
lifelong resident of Savannah. He attended local schools and earned his 
degree in industrial management from the Georgia Institute of 
Technology.
  Mr. Bradley was an extremely hardworking individual, serving as the 
president of the Dixie Plywood Company for over 56 years.
  Mr. Bradley also remained active in the Georgia Tech community for 
many years. He served as a trustee of the Georgia Tech National Alumni 
Association, a member of the Georgia Tech National Advisory Board, and 
a member of the Georgia Tech Regional Engineering Program, and several 
others.
  For over 76 years, Mr. Bradley was an active member of the Wesley 
Monumental United Methodist Church, serving on several boards within 
the community. It is here that I met Mr. Bradley, and I will tell you, 
he was one of the finest men I have ever met. He also served on the 
advisory board of the Salvation Army for two decades.
  Mr. Bradley was a generous, faithful man, known by all for his 
integrity and loyalty. He will be greatly missed, and my heart goes out 
to his friends and family.


         Congratulating Effingham County Middle School Students

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate five 
Effingham County Middle School students on their selection for the 
REACH Georgia scholarship.

[[Page H6812]]

  The recipients of this scholarship are Grace Mouhon of Effingham 
County Middle School, Armon'e Burt and Kellan Langford of Ebenezer 
Middle School, and Joel Barrera and Ryder English of South Effingham 
Middle School.
  At the end of November, all five students signed their REACH Georgia 
scholarship contracts alongside each other. Due to their stellar 
academic performance and outstanding attendance and behavior, these 
students will graduate high school with a $10,000 scholarship that is 
eligible for use at HOPE institutions.
  Each student must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5, work with mentors, 
and remain drug- and alcohol-free throughout high school.
  Our district is incredibly proud of these hardworking, accomplished 
students. I look forward to the opportunity to follow the future 
successes of these students, and I wish them the very best along their 
academic journey.


                          Honoring Dan Wright

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
Dan Wright.
  Mr. Wright, nicknamed ``Skip,'' acquired the name from his father, 
who enlisted in the Army as a captain after his graduation from dental 
school.
  Mr. Wright was an excellent athlete throughout his life. He showcased 
his athletic prowess as an outstanding football player and a black-
diamond skier.
  Mr. Wright attended school at the Citadel prior to being drafted into 
the Vietnam war, where he received a Bronze Star for his service to his 
beloved country.
  Upon his return home, Mr. Wright finished school at East Carolina 
State with a degree in business and finance, which propelled him into 
his impressive career as a mortgage banker in both Atlanta and St. 
Simons until his retirement. He was a dedicated member of both Christ 
Church Frederica and his cherished golf club, Sea Island.
  Mr. Wright was preceded in death by his two sons, Dan and Thomas, and 
his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Wright.
  Mr. Wright will be greatly missed by his friends, family, and golf 
partners. My heart goes out to all of them.

                    IN MEMORY OF SENATOR FRED HARRIS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Fred Harris, a Senator, civil rights and Tribal advocate, Presidential 
candidate, chairman, professor, and so much more to the people lucky 
enough to have known him.
  The title that I love best for my dear friend is ``radical 
optimist.'' In times when we might despair, like the time we find 
ourselves in now, Fred never gave in to fatalism. Instead, Fred asked 
each of us to charge ahead with commitment and courage. His radical 
optimism was not passive but proactive.
  He called upon us to each act with purpose and passion, to find the 
unique places where each of us could lend our action to change the 
direction of the world to better. He called upon us to act collectively 
in the joy that comes from working together with friends and colleagues 
on a cause.
  I first met Senator Harris as a young attorney working on Tribal 
issues in New Mexico. He shared stories of his work together with 
LaDonna Harris, his former wife, elevating Native American issues 
across this country.

  Senator Harris sponsored the landmark bill to restore sacred Blue 
Lake to Taos Pueblo. He created the bipartisan alliance that led to 
President Richard Nixon signing that bill into law in 1970. Blue Lake 
became the touchstone and spark for the return of sacred lands to 
Tribal nations across this country.
  Senator Harris and his beautiful wife, Margaret Elliston, herself a 
democracy hero, then became good friends as I myself ran for office. 
His deep laughter and inexhaustible supply of stories to illustrate a 
path forward helped me immensely over the last 5 years.
  Harris' career included serving in Oklahoma and the United States 
Senate as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Throughout his 
career and his many roles, he always led and listened with courage and 
empathy.
  He was a strong supporter of and voted for--imagine this--the Voting 
Rights Act in 1965 during his first year in the United States Senate 
and continued to advocate until this year.
  At the University of New Mexico, he founded the Fred Harris 
Internship Program. Since 2006, Congress has welcomed smart, dedicated 
New Mexicans to serve in our delegation offices. I have hosted and then 
hired Fred Harris interns because they bring with them the same radical 
optimism as their sponsor.
  I hope his family takes solace in the fact that every intern and 
person whose life he touched will keep his spirit alive as they also 
bring his love of country, community, and service to their own life 
work.
  Senator Harris' legacy will ring through history in the laughter and 
radical optimism he left us.


          Recognizing Santa Fe New Mexican's 175th Anniversary

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my 
hometown newspaper, the Santa Fe New Mexican, on its 175th anniversary. 
The first issue of the paper was printed in 1849.
  The New Mexican has brought stories to life about gold strikes, 
floods, votes on prohibition, and debates on statehood and whether 
women should have the right to vote. It has shared stories of the 
struggles and strengths of the survivors of wildfires, informed voters 
about their local candidates, and anointed the best chili in the city.
  To keep democracy strong, it made sure voters understood the 
positions and perspectives of local, Senate, Federal, and national 
candidates for office.
  I myself like this one page from 1938 that juxtaposes the rise of 
fascism in Europe with Santa Fe's burning of old man gloom. My local 
newspaper was ahead of the curve. It took The New York Times 80 years 
before they reported on Zozobra.
  Santa Feans, as the New Mexican has shown, have been choosing joy 
over fascism for over 100 years.
  Stories matter, and who tells them matters just as much. That is why 
it is important that an independent paper with integrity, like the New 
Mexican, has been telling stories about our communities since it was 
founded. Papers like the New Mexican keep us well-informed and active 
citizens.
  In this time of democracy at risk, we need papers like the New 
Mexican, and I am so happy to be on this floor to celebrate its 
anniversary.

                        MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. Mann) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, for 4 years, the Biden administration's weak 
foreign policies allowed Communist China, Russia, Iran, and other 
adversaries to take full advantage of America. This weakness has put 
Americans in danger, made America less secure, and hurt America's 
reputation with our longstanding allies and friends.
  When President Biden campaigned for President, he promised Americans 
that he would be a unifying figure. Rather than sticking to his word, 
he spent much of his tenure undoing President Trump's popular policies, 
foreign and domestic, regardless of their effectiveness.
  This stubbornness and pure partisanship have backfired and made 
America less secure than it was just 4 years ago. For example, 
President Biden orchestrated the largest botched withdrawal of American 
troops of our generation when he abandoned vulnerable Americans in 
Afghanistan and allowed the Taliban to regain control and diminish the 
freedoms our country worked so hard to preserve.
  When President Trump worked on the Doha agreement, he required the 
Taliban to curb terrorist activity in Afghanistan and the region. 
President Biden, on the other hand, never required the Taliban to agree 
to those same conditions, withdrew without a long-term strategy, and 
allowed terrorists to make themselves at home in Afghanistan once 
again.
  President Biden's weakness on the world stage continues to be on full 
display in the Middle East in his appeasement strategy with the Iranian 
regime.

[[Page H6813]]

Iran is not America's friend. We all know that, yet President Biden 
ignores Iran's bad intentions and Iran's possession of resources that 
pose a great threat to our allies, including Israel.
  While President Trump applied a maximum-pressure strategy that 
constrained Tehran financially, President Biden was at the helm as 
Iranian-backed militias attacked our troops more than 170 times without 
consequence. President Biden's so-called strategy only emboldened Hamas 
and other Iran-backed proxies to attack our ally Israel, launching the 
deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
  Other adversaries are closely watching. China continues planning its 
invasion of Taiwan and increases its influence in America's absence. 
Just this week, several of my colleagues joined me in expressing 
concerns to President Biden about Communist China's growing influence 
at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. A recent 
proposal from the current FAO director-general and former Chinese Vice 
Minister would extend the director-general's tenure from 8 years to a 
decade, increase his already $300,000 salary, and give Communist China 
more control of the U.S.-led World Food Program.

  America cannot afford to sit by idly, even during our time of 
political transition, while China positions itself to expand its 
influence.
  I have been blessed to grow up in a world where the United States has 
led the free world. I want my children, their children, and future 
generations to grow up in a similar world, but I understand that 
leadership didn't come from being passive or trying to tap dance around 
communism.
  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, one of Kansas' favorite sons, 
military hero, and our 34th United States President, dedicated his 
entire career to promoting freedom and waging peace. He helped shape 
the global U.S. leadership many of us know today. In his inaugural 
address, he said: ``History does not long entrust the care of freedom 
to the weak or the timid.''
  Unfortunately, the Biden administration has chosen timidness and 
tiptoed approaches to foreign policy to placate far-left activists. 
Luckily, Mr. Speaker, this will soon be over. I would say to America 
that we got it right. President Trump is committed to securing American 
peace through strength and making it clear to our enemies that we will 
not tolerate any nonsense.
  It is a new day in America, and the days of American weakness are 
gone. I look forward to working with President Trump and the incoming 
House and Senate Republican majorities to restore America's leadership 
and make the country safe again. Our brightest days are yet to come.

            NYC SUBWAY CHOKING DEATH IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Jackson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise because one of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle has introduced legislation to 
award the Congressional Gold Medal for heroism to Mr. Daniel Penny for 
choking a man to death on the New York City subway.
  Just the other day, a New York City jury found Daniel Penny not 
guilty of the choke-hold death of Jordan Neely.
  To think that Members of this body would consider the circumstances 
of this case to be anything other than a complete tragedy for everyone 
is cruel.
  When a young man is suffering from a mental health breakdown and 
loses his life at the hands of a 24-year-old veteran, who is probably 
also suffering from a particular set of challenges, there is absolutely 
nothing to celebrate here.

                              {time}  1130

  I say this, Mr. Speaker, because even the prosecutor said that Mr. 
Penny went too far. Mr. Neely was not just a Michael Jackson 
impersonator who was crying out, both hungry and thirsty. Mr. Neely was 
not a distressed person on a train or some kind of public nuance, as 
was described. He was someone's son, he was somebody's friend, and he 
was no less a part of the fabric of this American mosaic as any one of 
us who rightfully stands here today.
  Yes, no one could deny that Jordan Neely had challenges, but who 
among us does not have people in our districts who are suffering from 
all kinds of struggles and setbacks. Each and every one of us represent 
people who are wrestling with the vicissitudes of life each and every 
day.
  Yes, like millions of Americans, Jordan Neely was homeless. He 
struggled from mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007. In 
spite of all of his challenges, Mr. Neely was a human being. He was as 
much a person worthy of respect as anybody and no less deserving of 
compassion and de-escalation as any of us in this Chamber.
  When he got on the train that day, he had no weapon, he had not 
touched anyone, and more importantly, he was asking for help. Instead 
of encountering kindness, he was choked to death.
  Rather than being seen as a brother and a sister, we have become so 
heartless that we see each other as combatants in a war that none of us 
can win as long as we are committed to fighting each other.
  I wonder today: Have we become so desensitized to cruelty that we 
would dare to celebrate savagery in this Chamber without regard for the 
tragic loss of life?
  When a jury cannot determine that a man should not be executed for 
having a mental outburst, one wonders is this the future of justice in 
America for people who are not well, for people who are not rich, for 
people not living in a home with locked doors and carpeted hallways?
  There are over 110 billionaires who live in New York City, but Jordan 
was not one of those persons. The greatest amalgamation of wealth in 
the history of the world congregates in the city of New York, but 
Jordan Neely was not a part of it. Yet, he was as American as any of 
the captains of industry who work on Wall Street, who fly off to the 
Hamptons in order to enjoy their weekend pursuits.
  All over the city of Chicago, people are wondering: If the racial 
roles were reversed, would Mr. Penny have been allowed to walk away 
without any accountability?
  I find the jury decision to be appalling on many levels and not the 
least of which because all life is sacred. As long as one of us is 
disposable, then all of us are in the candidacy to fall victim to the 
reaffirming silence that allows evil to flourish.
  The denunciation of cruelty should not be a partisan issue. We should 
not be so eager to run to our partisan corners when it comes to mental 
illness and the tragic loss of life.
  I say to my colleagues and to the American people: There should be no 
medals for this act. There should be no knee-jerk partisan celebration 
that degrades the life of a man suffering from mental illness by making 
a mockery of his death.
  I hope in the days to come, all of us will do what we can to inspire 
our constituents to find a more excellent way.
  I pray that in the weeks to come, we will resist the temptation to 
give in to the darker impulses that live in the shadows of our great 
democratic experiment. We will, in the best of our ability, work to 
ensure life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all who make 
this country their home.

                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:

[[Page H6814]]

  Lord, You have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. 
Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, 
from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.
  And so we pause in this place to acknowledge Your hand in the 
governing of our Nation. We give thanks to You that from generation to 
generation, and Congress to Congress, You have called men and women to 
serve in this House, upholding the values of freedom and liberty on 
which our country was founded. We honor their continued defense of the 
rights and welfare of the people and communities who make up these 
United States.
  Call us this day and every day, in office or out, to acknowledge the 
higher calling to which You call each of us, wherever You call each of 
us.
  May we ever live as agents of Your love, instruments of Your peace, 
and advocates of the hope You set before us. In Your most holy name we 
pray.
  Amen.


                          Pledge of Allegiance

  The Honorable Donna Edwards led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows:

       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of 
     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation 
     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

  Ms. EDWARDS. At this time the Chair recognizes Former Members of 
Congress President, the Honorable Barbara Comstock, for remarks.
  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Donna. It is always a great honor and 
distinct pleasure to return to this wonderful Chamber, especially when 
being able to do so with so many friends and former colleagues.
  Let me begin by thanking Speaker Johnson for inviting our association 
into the House Chamber for our annual report.
  Like most of us, I consider my service in Congress one of the most 
important and impactful chapters of my professional life. The memories 
of this Chamber are among the highlights of my work.
  I cherish the relationships I was able to forge with fellow Members, 
and I am proud of the legislation I was part of, both as a Member and 
as a staffer before I ran for Congress.
  What makes FMC, the Former Members of Congress Association, so 
special is that it empowers those of us who had this experience to 
continue giving back. We do so by involving both Senators and 
Representatives. More importantly, we do so in a completely bipartisan 
manner.
  FMC is 100 percent bipartisan, was founded in 1970, received its 
congressional charter in 1983, and functions as a standalone 501(c)(3) 
nonprofit charitable organization.
  Though chartered by Congress, no taxpayer dollars are earmarked for 
our work. Everything we do is funded through foundation grants and 
contributions, and all of our former Members donate their time pro 
bono. We don't pay any fee or honorarium for the many programs we are 
about to describe.
  Today my colleagues and I will focus on the two types of programs 
that help us accomplish FMC's mission of strengthening democracy, our 
international projects, most notably the Congressional Study Groups, 
and our domestic work like Congress to Campus.
  As you hear more about the work former Members are engaged in, you 
will see that everything we do fits neatly into the mission of 
strengthening representative democracy. An important part of 
accomplishing that mission is to support current Members and Congress 
as an institution. No work better illustrates that aspect of FMC than 
our partnership with the House Administration Subcommittee on 
Modernization.
  We were privileged to work with Derek Kilmer of Washington and 
William Timmons of South Carolina when this was a select committee, and 
we are equally proud of our partnership with Chairwoman Bice as she 
leads this newly created House Administration subcommittee.
  Ms. EDWARDS. At this time the chair recognizes the Honorable Speaker  
 Mike Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being here.
  The SPEAKER. You know what, I am going to stand right in the middle. 
How about that.
  I am so grateful to all of you.
  Barbara, good to see you.
  Donna, thank you, and Cheri, and everybody who does so much good work 
for this organization.
  This has been a wild week for us. They are all wild weeks now. We 
keep making history. I keep saying to Stephanie that we don't want to 
make history. We just want a normal Congress. Nobody knows what that 
looks like anymore.
  It has been an interesting week. Monday night, I was in here. I was 
doing a late-night tour. I don't get to do those anymore.
  My son was here, Barbara. He is a freshman at the U.S. Naval Academy. 
He brought 40 midshipmen, his classmates. They came in full uniform. It 
is such a proud thing to see them here. Half the group had never been 
to the Capitol before. They are just in Annapolis, but they come from 
all over the country.
  They came in here, and they were seated right here. I let them walk 
in, as we do, for late-night tours. You have all done it. Everybody 
just takes their seat. I said, you guys are all on the Democrat side. 
It was fun.
  I shared with them some of the neat features of our Chamber here. 
What was really moving to me was the awe that was on their faces. Now 
these are young people who have signed up to serve our country, and 
they really believe in this grand experiment in self-governance like we 
all do. To see the wonder, almost childlike wonder on the faces of 
these midshipmen, was so moving to me because sometimes we get sort of 
numb to it because of all the craziness every day. It is the 
relationships here that help us through all these crazy times. I loved 
seeing that on their faces.
  I kept them for like 1\1/2\ hours. We took them in and I showed them 
everything I could, every little secret spot and the Lincoln burial 
tunnel and all that stuff.
  Then yesterday was another stirring event. It really moved me. It is 
hard to get moved these days because there is so much crazy stuff going 
on, but we gave out the John W. McCormack Award, which is named after 
Speaker McCormack who, I think, served 9 years as Speaker, but served a 
total of 43 years in the House all the way through his career. This 
award is given to a staff member, the highest award we give to the 
House staff, for dedication, service, and bipartisanship.
  We gave the award to two very worthy recipients yesterday. One of 
them has been serving the House for 44 years. In fact, I brought the 
names of both of these guys because you will know them.
  You all probably know Ted Daniel. He finally got the award. He served 
a year longer than John W. McCormack for whom this award is named, 
which is pretty awesome.
  Then Dan Turton, who tragically passed away last year. His wife and 
his five children were there, his widow. It was very moving. The 
remarks that both of those people gave about this institution, about 
the people they served under and with, about Members who had come and 
gone on to other things in their careers and some who had passed away, 
it was so moving to just see that living history, somebody who has been 
witness to it--who has served under almost all of you--and to see the 
reverence that he has for this place and how important it is.
  So what you do as the Former Members of Congress Association is carry 
on this grand institution. It is such as awesome thing. We are the 
stewards of this grand experiment in self-governance now. Current 
Members, former Members, we have held that and carried it along. For 
the younger folks here, you are not former Members, though I am glad 
you are here.
  I always remind younger people and remind myself that there is no 
guarantee that this grand experiment in self-governance is going to 
last. This still is an experiment. We are almost 250 years into it. It 
falls to us, all of us, current Members and former Members, to help 
carry that banner and people who will take it after us. It is an 
awesome thing to consider.
  I love me some Stephanie Bice. Can I say that? She is so worthy of 
this award. She truly is because she exemplifies public service, a 
servant's heart. She is an influencer because she has such integrity, 
and there are not enough things that I could appoint her

[[Page H6815]]

to or ask her to do. The problem is she will say yes to all of it, and 
I don't want to wear her out.
  There is no more worthy recipient.
  So thank you all for your service to the country and what you do and 
for carrying on this grand tradition. It means so much to all of us.
  Sorry to interrupt. I would never interrupt.
  Ms. EDWARDS. It is a great honor, your being here.
  The SPEAKER. No, I am happy to do it. We have some new Members. Now 
you are joining the real esteemed group.
  I am grateful to all of you. Thank you so much. Sorry to interrupt.
  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
  I know it is like being a grandparent, Brandon. It is all the fun 
without the responsibility.
  This weekend, I was privileged to be able to bring some college 
friends who were political science graduates like myself. They always 
have that awe of being here.
  So thank you all, and thank you, Mr. Speaker.
  So much has been accomplished by FMC thanks to the commitment of 
these Members, like Congressman Kilmer and Bill Timmons, who take a 
close, hard look at how Congress operates as an institution and what 
reforms can be made to empower Members and congressional staff.
  I am pleased to announce that Derek Kilmer, once he becomes a former 
Member in a couple of weeks, will join the FMC board and will continue 
to be a partner to Chairwoman Bice in that capacity.
  I am also pleased to welcome Chairwoman Bice to the House Chamber 
this morning so that we can properly recognize her exceptional 
leadership in this space. I would ask Chairwoman Bice to join me at the 
dais.
  FMC is incredibly pleased to present our 2024 Distinguished Service 
Award to the chair of the House Administration Subcommittee on 
Modernization, Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma.
  Thanks to your leadership, there have been remarkable strides in 
fostering collaboration across party lines, proving that Congress can 
work together for the common good.
  Under your leadership, the subcommittee has made critical 
recommendations that will have a lasting impact on the functionality 
and effectiveness of Congress. From ensuring access to legislative 
data, to improving accessibility to the Nation's Capital, and promoting 
the use of modern technology to streamline operations, your work has 
been tireless and exemplary.
  Your former colleagues are, therefore, extremely pleased to recognize 
you with our annual award.
  In addition, we believe you will find this book, ``The First 
Congress: How James Madison, George Washington, and a Group of 
Extraordinary Men Invented the Government'' by historian Fergus 
Bordewich, extremely interesting. The author was kind enough to include 
a personal inscription for you.
  Now we would welcome your remarks.
  Mrs. BICE. Thank you very much.
  First of all, thank you, Barbara, and to the former Members for 
honoring me. It is truly an incredible honor for me to receive this.
  I think it would be wise for me to share with all of you how I got 
here because it is sort of a fun story.
  When I came to Congress, it was 2021. COVID was rampant. Being a 
freshman and going through orientation was challenging for a lot of 
reasons. I had served in the State legislature prior, and I had done a 
sort of mentor program. As I did orientation here in Washington, there 
were some things that I thought should be different.
  The Speaker talked about coming on the House floor with the 
midshipmen last night. When I was a Member-elect, I walked onto this 
floor after about 3 days of orientation, and I thought to myself: Why 
did it take so long?
  When you have that first moment on this House floor, there is no 
greater moment. You have worked so hard to get here. You never forget 
it.
  I wanted that opportunity to be the first thing that happened on 
orientation. When you got to D.C., it should be at night. It should be 
quiet. You should get to come and sit in these chairs, where only a few 
thousand people before us have sat, and take this moment in.
  I decided to take it upon myself to make a suggestion to the Speaker, 
the leader at the time, on what should be different, should we be in 
the majority and be able to sort of decide how orientation goes.
  Fast-forward a year, I landed in D.C. from the Marshall Scholars 
trip. I got a call from the Speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, who 
said: I have some great news for you. I am going to put you on the 
House Administration Committee, and you are going to be the chairwoman 
of the House Administration Subcommittee on Modernization.
  I didn't call him ``Mr. Speaker'' for a reason that you will 
understand in a second. I said: Kevin, you have waived me onto the 
House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. I am now the 
designee to Budget from Appropriations. I am an appropriator, and now 
you have put me on House Administration.
  His response was: It is going to be great.
  Mr. UPTON. It is better than the House Committee on Ethics.
  Mrs. BICE. It is true, Mr. Upton. It is better than the House 
Committee on Ethics.
  For those Members that have been around for a while, I tell you that 
to say that I was in for a challenge. As the Members know, being on 
four committees is not an easy task.
  The coolest part of that experience, though, is I had just landed and 
had just spent 4 days with Derek Kilmer, who I did not know until that 
trip. I think it was serendipitous that I was given this opportunity.
  It has been a great pleasure. It has taken a lot of work because I 
was not on the select committee to be able to understand what had been 
done the 4 years prior.
  I feel honored and privileged to be in this role. I hope that I am 
making the former Members proud, and I hope that I am making this 
institution better for the long term.
  I could not do this job, this role, without staff. I see Derek Harley 
sitting over here, who, sadly, is leaving me soon. I couldn't do it 
without an incredible staff on the Committee on House Administration 
team, so thank you to Derek and Marian and all of those who have been a 
part of this.
  My personal office staff, Robert Sar, Wesley Harkins, my deputy 
chief, Jett Thompson, these individuals have all been a tremendous part 
of making sure that I am successful in this role. I couldn't do this 
without them.
  I want to say thank you. Thank you for this great opportunity and for 
this honor to be recognized today.
  Ms. EDWARDS. The Chair thanks and congratulates Chairwoman Bice.
  The Chair now invites two former Members, Dennis Ross of Florida and 
Cheri Bustos of Illinois, to offer remarks.
  Mr. ROSS. I thank the Chair, and it is good to see the Chair in the 
chair. It is a pleasure, my friend.
  I also want to congratulate Representative Bice on her exceptional 
leadership to the House Administration Subcommittee on Modernization.
  It is my pleasure to report on FMC's Congressional Study Groups on 
Germany, Japan, Europe, and Korea. In keeping with our mission to 
support the Congress, FMC has established itself as a premier convener 
of bipartisan, non-advocacy, and candid discussion on timely issues at 
home and abroad.
  By connecting Congress at the Member and staff levels with their 
international counterparts, the diplomatic community, academia, and the 
business community, we foster the mutual understanding, 
personal relationships, and continued presence that is essential for 
the productive functioning of this body for the American people.

  All this important activity is accomplished through international 
Member and staff delegations overseas and roundtable programs here in 
Washington as well as in regional settings.
  Together, the study groups are proud to count almost 200 current 
Representatives and Senators as members. Each study group is led by a 
bipartisan, bicameral group of four co-chairs. These dedicated co-
chairs embody the study groups' commitment to meaningful and dynamic 
engagement and take the mission to heart by donating their valuable 
time and energy to support FMC's programming.

[[Page H6816]]

  Beyond their contributions at official study group events, they 
actively collaborate with embassies and external organizations, 
participate in panels, attend roundtables, and meet with numerous 
visiting delegations to advance the objectives of their respective 
study groups and strengthen the international relationships they 
foster.
  This year, we welcome my friend, Representative   Andy Barr of 
Kentucky, who has become co-chair of the Congressional Study Group on 
Japan, and look forward to continuing to work with his predecessor, 
Larry Bucshon of Indiana, who will remain active in FMC as part of our 
board of directors following his retirement from elected office.
  The work of the study groups would not be possible without the 
generous support of committed individuals, organizations, and Business 
Advisory Council members. In particular, I would like to recognize Dr. 
Satohiro Akimoto of Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, Thomas Byrne of The 
Korea Society, Sung Won Bae of the Korea Foundation USA, as well as the 
German Marshall Fund of the United States and the Japan-U.S. Friendship 
Commission.
  I include in the Record a list of the FMC's Business Advisory Council 
members.

                        APPRECIATING JJ JACKSON

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
2024 Army Congressional Fellow, Major ``JJ'' Joshua Jackson, for his 
service to the country and the Second District of South Carolina.
  Throughout his congressional tenure, JJ has been a valued team member 
working on military and veterans' issues, including today, the NDAA, 
the National Defense Authorization Act.
  As an air defense artillery officer, JJ has held numerous positions 
with a distinguished career, including tours in valued allies, Saudi 
Arabia and Jordan. He most recently served the Pentagon as a 
legislative liaison with the Department of the Army.
  A Georgia native, JJ graduated from West Point where he was a starter 
on the Army football team.
  We wish JJ and his young daughters, Amaya and Noah, the best of 
continued success.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent as warned by the FBI. Donald Trump will 
reinstitute existing laws to protect American families with peace 
through strength.
  America celebrates its first ally, France, with yesterday the 
historic 200th anniversary of the address to Congress by the Marquis de 
Lafayette with his portrait here in the Chamber along with the portrait 
of George Washington, the only two portraits here in the Chamber.

                             SHOES FOR KIDS

  (Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 35th 
anniversary of a remarkable event in my district. Shoes for Kids began 
with a simple donation of just 50 pairs of shoes and has now grown into 
a movement, making sure no child in Houston faces the challenges of not 
having shoes to wear.
  Mr. Speaker, these shoes are more than just footwear, Mr. Speaker. 
They protect little feet, yes; but they also boost confidence, support 
proper posture, and encourage physical activity.
  The founder of this event, Yolanda Black Navarro, was a dear friend. 
Although she is no longer with us, her vision lives on.
  By partnering with schools and community centers, Shoes for Kids also 
addresses critical challenges in children's lives starting, quite 
literally, from the ground up.
  By supporting our children, we are putting the right foot forward, 
and we are putting children over politics.

address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
Bellefonte Area High School's Concert Choir milestone event, performing 
ahead of the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall.
  On Monday, December 16, 32 students from Bellefonte Area High School

Christmas Spectacular in New York City.
  The Bellefonte Area High School Concert Choir was selected to

program that allows groups to apply to perform as openers for the 
Christmas Spectacular.
  For their 5-minute holiday-themed a cappella performance, BAHS will 
perform two pieces: ``Noel Nouvelet,'' a setting of a French carol, and 
a vocal jazz setting of ``It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.''
  Mr. Speaker, the Rockettes' Radio City Christmas Spectacular is a 
cherished tradition that brings the spirit of Christmas to life for 
audiences from around the world.
  Congratulations to the Bellefonte Area High School Concert Choir for 
their dedication, hard work, and their contributions to the iconic 
Christmas Spectacular.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  Sovereign God, You and You alone know the plans You have for each one 
of us, for this body, and for this Nation. In Your mercy, You have 
promised that what You have designed for us is for our welfare and not 
for our harm, to give us a future with hope.
  We call upon You then and pray to You, trusting in Your divine 
provision, claiming what You have promised, even when Your will is not 
always clear to us, even when the problems of the present prevent us 
from imagining the favorable future You have foretold.
  In the concerns and confusions that clutter our lives, we search for 
You. We seek You with our whole hearts. Lord, let us find You.
  Restore to us the fortune of faith: the assuredness, the confidence, 
and the conviction that is ours when we acknowledge Your divine hand in 
our lives and Your favor upon us. It is in Your merciful name we dare 
to pray.
  Amen.

   RECOGNIZING THE EXEMPLARY SERVICE OF RALEIGH POLICE CHIEF ESTELLA 
                               PATTERSON

  (Ms. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary 
service of

[[Page H6821]]

Raleigh Police Chief Estella Patterson, who recently announced that she 
will retire next year.
  Since Chief Patterson joined the Raleigh Police Department in 2021, I 
have been proud to have worked with her on many issues. She has led the 
charge to lower crime rates, address gun violence, recognize mental 
health issues, and more. Chief Patterson offered vital input on my 
legislation, the Supporting Women COPS, which would incentivize more 
women to join law enforcement.
  She has continued to prioritize a police force that represents the 
community it serves. Chief Patterson also led our community through one 
of its darkest times, the Hedingham shooting that stole five precious 
lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chief Patterson for all she has done for our 
community. I wish her good luck in her retirement and her future 
endeavors.

                     ADDRESSING THE WILDFIRE CRISIS

  (Mr. HARDER of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
passage of the bipartisan Disaster Management Costs Modernization Act.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On December 11, 2024, page H6821, in the third column, the 
following appeared: (Mr HARDER asked and was given permission to

  The online version has been corrected to read: (Mr. HARDER of 
California asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.) Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  This bill is one pillar of my landmark, comprehensive legislation to 
address the worsening wildfire crisis. It transforms our fight against 
wildfires, moving us from our current reactive approach to a proactive 
plan to prevent mega fires.
  For too long, we have been playing catch-up with wildfires instead of 
preventing them. This bill flips the script, cutting red tape so 
communities like mine can tap into existing disaster funds before those 
flames threaten our homes. It means communities can rebuild faster, 
strengthen their defenses, and avoid devastating losses down the road.
  We know wildfire prevention will cost $6 billion each year, and this 
proactive approach is more cost effective, and it is the best way to 
protect our neighbors, keep our firefighters safe, and speed up help 
when families need it.
  The passage of this bill is a major step forward, and I look forward 
to the full passage of my full wildfire modernization process package 
as soon as possible now and for the future.

       ESCALATING CRISIS OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN BANGLADESH

  (Mr. THANEDAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness of the 
human rights violations in Bangladesh against the minority Hindus.
  Since 1971 when Bangladesh got its freedom from Pakistan, there has 
been numerous occasions where minority Hindus have been attacked. More 
recently we have seen a Hindu priest being arrested and his lawyer was 
murdered.
  The crowds of the majority have destroyed Hindu temples, Hindu 
deities, and Hindus who are practicing their religion in peace. The 
time has now come for the United States Congress to act and the U.S. 
Government to act. It is important whether we use humanitarian issues, 
economic sanctions, every possible tool in our hands needs to be used 
to ensure that such atrocities in Bangladesh against the Hindus stop 
right away.

  (Mr. MILLER of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Cleveland Museum of Natural History ahead of their grand reopening.
  The Cleveland Museum of Natural History has been teaching people from 
all over America about the natural world for more than a century, and 
it has been a global leader in scientific research, science education, 
and conservation.
  The museum serves over 300,000 people each year, including 30,000 
students. The museum's collection encompasses approximately 5 million 
specimens, and its Natural Areas Program protects more than 12,000 
acres of natural habitats in northeast Ohio.
  This week's opening of the new 50,000-square-foot expansion of the 
Cleveland Museum of Natural History will launch a new era for the 
museum which will share science and the wonders of discovery for 
generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the museum on this momentous occasion, 
and I look forward to its next century of success.

                  RECOGNIZING SHANELLE SCALES-PRESTON

  (Mr. DeSAULNIER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shanelle 
Scales-Preston for her decades of service to the House of 
Representatives.
  Shanelle has lived in and served in Contra Costa County in northern 
California her whole life. Since 2001, she has worked diligently on 
behalf of district residents, first for my predecessor, Congressman 
George Miller, who served in this House for 40 years, and now for my 
office. As our district director, she has helped lead our efforts in 
the district to provide outstanding service to our constituents.
  Shanelle has also shown unwavering devotion to her hometown of 
Pittsburg, California, where she resides with her husband, Damon, and 
their sons, Jaden and Ashton. She has served on the Pittsburg City 
Council serving as mayor and council member since 2018, working 
tirelessly to foster a strong and diverse community throughout 
Pittsburg, California.
  Shanelle was chosen by the voters to serve as the next Contra Costa 
County supervisor for District 5. While I am very sad to see her go 
from our team, I am confident that in this role she will continue to be 
an effective and wonderful leader for our community, for our county, 
and for our country.
  It has been a joy to work with Shanelle throughout the years, and I 
am incredibly grateful and proud for her service.

                         HONORING HOWARD HAWKS

  (Mr. FLOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the incredible life 
and legacy of Nebraska's own, Howard Hawks.
  Howard was a generational leader who lived the American Dream, 
cofounding an energy company called Tenaska. Since founding the company 
in 1987, he helped grow it into one of the largest privately held 
companies in America.
  Mr. Speaker, if you know Howard Hawks, then you know that if he got 
involved in a project, people in a five-State area knew exactly what 
was going on, and it would get done.
  One of his greatest investments was at the University of Nebraska 
where he gave both his time and his treasure. He served almost two 
decades as a regent and helped strengthen our Husker athletic program 
as a booster.
  In recent years, he has provided the lead gift that helped build the 
University of Nebraska Lincoln Business School. This is just another 
example of his philanthropic projects that he took on throughout the 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, Howard will be missed. Our hearts and prayers go out to 
Rhonda and the entire Hawks family as we all mourn his loss.

            SINGLE, UNIQUE ZIP CODES FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill

[[Page H6822]]

(H.R. 8753) to direct the United States Postal Service to designate 
single, unique ZIP Codes for certain communities, and for other 
purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 8753

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. Boebert) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.


                             General Leave

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Colorado?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 8753, to direct the 
United States Postal Service to designate single, unique ZIP Codes 
within their system for certain communities throughout the country.
  While all the communities in this bill typically utilize some sort of 
ZIP Code already, the ones we are discussing today do not have a ZIP 
Code that is unique to their city or town in the Postal Service system, 
and this does have some very serious consequences.
  Communities that do not have a unique ZIP Code within the Postal 
Service system often experience associated problems that include loss 
of economic development, loss of sales tax, unjustifiably high 
insurance rates, tax remittance and commercial licensing issues, 
diminished public safety and reduced emergency response times, identity 
issues, and efficiency issues.
  For example, first responders often go to the wrong streets of people 
needing help. They are experiencing delays due to these ZIP Code issues 
that would be addressed by my legislation.
  It is estimated that the city of Lone Tree, in my new district in 
Colorado, is losing about $5 million in sales tax revenue each year 
because of this ZIP Code issue.
  H.R. 8753 requires the Postal Service to formally establish unique 
ZIP Codes for these communities across the Nation within their system. 
This bill is a product of various House Members' advocacy for their 
districts and requires the Postal Service to formally recognize 51 
communities within their system.
  As a sponsor of this bill, I am proud that this bill would help 
communities in my home State of Colorado, including the communities of 
Silver Cliff, which really got me passionate about this issue to begin 
with, Lone Tree, Castle Pines, Centennial, Severance, Greenwood 
Village, Superior, and Sterling Ranch.
  The current process allows small towns and cities to petition the 
Postal Service for a unique ZIP Code, but it is rarely approved. If it 
is denied, they cannot appeal this decision for up to 10 years.
  Congress has intervened on these matters in the past and passed laws 
enacting four unique ZIP Codes through the Postal Accountability and 
Enhancement Act of 2006, so there is a precedent for this type of 
legislation.
  My bipartisan bill has support from communities and Members 
throughout our great country. While this may seem like a niche issue to 
some, it is very and extremely important to these cities and towns that 
asked for this bill to be put forward on their behalf.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bipartisan bill to support small 
cities and towns throughout America, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. 
Boebert), my friend, for bringing forward H.R. 8753.
  This bill would require the U.S. Postal Service to designate unique 
ZIP Codes for more than 50 different communities across America. The 
legislation actually combines multiple bills that have been introduced 
in this Congress by both Republicans and Democrats that aim to address 
specific community concerns expressed over a long period of time about 
disrupted mail delivery, undeliverable and lost mail, and geographic 
confusion.
  I commend Representative Boebert for her very creative and undaunted 
work on this issue, which has been a chronic headache for residents of 
dozens of small communities across the land.
  For example, Scotland, Connecticut, is a municipality with only 600 
addresses, and it is broken up into six different ZIP Codes. The town 
has reported multiple instances of disruptions in mail delivery, 
including absentee ballots in recent elections. The town has already 
sought the assistance of the Postal Service, which operates a ZIP Code 
Boundary Review Process, and even sent an appeal after their initial 
petition was denied.
  The process has been protracted and a tough task for them, as well as 
for other communities covered by Ms. Boebert's legislation. The 
distinguished gentlewoman's bill operates as a last resort for towns to 
get the resources and the attention that they deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to support this legislation. Congress has 
designated new ZIP Codes via legislation in the past. I found the 
Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, enacted in 2006, required 
the designation of unique ZIP Codes for four different towns. This one 
is far more comprehensive.
  Mr. Speaker, we are delighted to endorse the legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Kim).
  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8753, which directs the 
U.S. Postal Service to designate unique ZIP Codes for certain 
communities, including North Tustin in my district.
  North Tustin is a longtime community and census designated place, but 
its status as an unincorporated area has caused confusion. Simply put, 
a unique ZIP Code is common sense, and it will help residents with 
postal delivery and taxation issues.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Griffith), my good friend.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bill. It is an 
important bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I represent the community of Fairlawn, Virginia. 
Fairlawn is in Pulaski County, but it has a Radford City ZIP Code.
  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues may say that is not such a big deal 
because, in most of the 50 States, the cities are within a county. In 
Virginia, the cities are completely independent.
  All the tax money of the numerous businesses in Fairlawn often gets 
sent mistakenly to the city of Radford, which is completely independent 
of Pulaski County, thus denying Pulaski County or making it a hassle 
for them to track down the accurate amounts of money that they are 
supposed to receive on the local part of the Virginia sales tax.
  Further, this confusion can create other problems. Recently, our area 
was hit with Hurricane Helene. Pulaski County got its designation 
early.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from Virginia.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Helene hit, the County of 
Pulaski was designated a couple of days before the city of Radford for 
FEMA assistance, and the people of Fairlawn were told that they were 
not in Pulaski but in Radford, so they couldn't get assistance.
  Mr. Speaker, this is why we need the bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Lopez), who represents the Fourth Congressional District.
  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Congresswoman 
Boebert's bill. She will be taking over for my district during the 
119th Congress, so it is an honor to be here to support this.
  For too long, this issue has been plaguing small communities. As a 
former mayor of Parker, Colorado, I know firsthand the challenges that 
residents have when they are not able to receive the mail on time and 
when they are not able to actually get emergency services.
  I believe that this is commonsense legislation. I am glad to see that 
our colleagues are supportive of it.
  Mr. Speaker, I champion this, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
unanimously behind this bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Langworthy).
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 
to H.R. 8753, Ms. Boebert's bill. I am very grateful for the 
gentlewoman bringing this forward.
  My amendment would designate a new ZIP Code for Pendleton, New York. 
Pendleton is a growing community that has long been overlooked in our 
postal infrastructure.
  Mail delays can cause serious consequences, especially for our 
seniors relying on timely medication or for local businesses depending 
on consistent shipping to serve their customers.
  This simple change would improve the quality of life for Pendleton 
residents by ensuring reliable access to essential goods and services 
by mail and providing a distinct geographic identity for our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, we have many colleagues who are excited 
about this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Nehls).
  Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8753, 
which directs the United States Postal Service to designate single, 
unique ZIP Codes for communities across the country that currently do 
not have one.
  These communities, including Sargent, Texas, in my district, and 
others, such as Somers, Wisconsin, do not have their own unique ZIP 
Codes and can experience a wide variety of associated problems. They 
include inconsistent postal deliveries, longer emergency response 
times, loss of economic development, and loss of sales tax, just to 
name a few.
  This legislation is a simple, essential, and commonsense solution to 
help our cities and towns across the country that currently do not have 
unique ZIP Codes.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, before I start on the content 
of this legislation, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. 
Boebert), the sponsor of this legislation. I also thank Chairman Comer 
and Mr. Raskin for working together.
  Mr. Speaker, that is the only nice thing I am going to say because I 
am frustrated that we are here. We have the greatest country in the 
world, and we can't even figure out how to do ZIP Codes. This is 
something the post office should just do on their own.
  The fact that we have to do legislation to fix this is frustrating, 
but I do thank my friends because my friends have refused to let the 
bureaucracy sit here and stew, leaving these ridiculous conditions in 
place. They have come in and proposed a solution on a bipartisan basis.
  Particularly in my district in south Louisiana, the community of 
Montz, in St. Charles Parish, has a mess of a ZIP Code, so this 
actually ensures that they are going to have their own ZIP Code.
  Then, of course, the greatest university in the Nation--I will let it 
come to mind; that is right, LSU, and I hope you got it right--
Louisiana State University has a broken up, bifurcated ZIP Code system. 
This bill fixes that, as well.
  Again, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert), Mr. 
Raskin, and Chairman Comer for working together. I thank them for 
fixing these issues.
  Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: Post offices should be able to do 
this on their own. I hate that we have to spend time in Congress doing 
this. This is just red tape that should be able to be fixed on its own. 
I thank the sponsors of this bill for not putting up with it. I 
appreciate their leadership in working together.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) for 
his very thoughtful and insightful remarks on this. We had the 
Postmaster General with us yesterday in the Oversight Committee, and we 
are facing a crisis in lots of parts of the country in terms of 
undelivered mail, late mail, and inefficient delivery taking place. In 
the meantime, the costs are going up and up.

                              {time}  1230

  There is a lot of work that needs to be done in the post office. The 
post office is really the only Federal department that is defined by 
the Constitution itself. It is in Article I of the Constitution. The 
post office created the national transportation network, the postal 
roads. It created the national information network. Benjamin Franklin 
was the first Postmaster General.
  We have got to bring the post office back to a point where we can 
rely on it to do the basic things that are so essential to our economy 
and to our society, and one of them is lining up the ZIP Codes 
properly.
  Again, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado for her 
initiative, which is truly bipartisan, to loop together all of the 
communities that have been very frustrated and disappointed in this 
process to say that Congress will, indeed, act.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I associate my remarks with the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. Graves). This is a very frustrating thing that we have to be in 
Congress debating and issuing legislation on.
  I am so proud to be here and have a part in that, but this is 
something that should have been done. Many of these

[[Page H6824]]

cities, many of these communities have requested the United States 
Postal Service to give them a unique ZIP Code, and they have been 
denied.
  This started for me with the town of Silver Cliff in Colorado. It is 
one of the most beautiful towns right next to Westcliffe, Colorado in 
Custer County. In my first term, I represented Custer County before 
redistricting. They were taken away from me, but this was one of the 
very first issues that I learned of as their Representative.
  It was not the first time this issue was brought to a Member of 
Congress. Two Members of Congress prior to me had heard about this 
issue, had legislation on this issue, and the legislation did not go 
forward.
  In the Oversight Committee, we do have jurisdiction over the United 
States Postal Service, and I am so grateful for Chairman Comer and 
Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, who have worked so diligently alongside of 
me to get this legislation through committee with complete and full 
support of every Member, and now I am looking forward to this 
bipartisan legislation passing the House, going to the Senate, and 
hopefully being signed into law.
  I thank Senator Bennet for also being passionate about the cities who 
need unique ZIP Codes in Colorado, but hopefully we don't need 
legislation in the future to designate these ZIP Codes, to get the 
people what they deserve. Hopefully, this sets a precedent for the 
United States Postal Service to approve these communities' requests, 
and it won't take an act of Congress to do the right thing.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8753 to 
designate single, unique ZIP Codes for communities across the United 
States.
  Madam Speaker, communities lacking a unique ZIP Code often experience 
a host of issues that extend beyond just the delivery of mail and can 
impact everything from economic development to emergency response.
  This is no exception for the community of Mills, Wyoming, whose 
existing designation has caused issues with residential mail delivery, 
loss of property tax revenue and franchise fees, and incorrect census 
accounts.
  Each of these issues poses significant challenges for Mills as it 
continues to grow, develop, and attract new residents across Wyoming 
and beyond.
  Passage of this bill will go a long way to correct this oversight, 
not only for Mills, but for other communities nationwide.
  I am grateful to the city of Mills and their advocacy on this 
legislation, and I am proud to be one of its cosponsors.
  I will also mirror what Representative Boebert was saying about the 
importance of mail delivery in our communities. Coming from the least 
populated State in the Nation and one of the largest landwise, I can 
assure you that having consistent and reliable mail delivery is 
absolutely critically important, not only for the delivery of 
medication to our veterans, but to make sure that we are able to comply 
with a variety of laws.
  I thank Representative Boebert and Chairman Comer for their 
leadership on this critically important issue and I support this 
legislation to resolve these issues for my constituents in Mills.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 8753.
  Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I thank everyone, once again, all of the 
cosponsors, all of my colleagues who have supported this legislation, 
Ranking Member Raskin, and Chairman Comer.
  This has been an amazing effort that we have come together to 
designate these unique ZIP Codes to recognize these cities.
  I want the people to understand we know there are more cities and 
towns throughout each and every State that are facing this issue and, 
hopefully, the United States Postal Service will do the right thing in 
the future once they see what we can do by passing a bill like H.R. 
8753 and providing these cities and towns with the identity that they 
deserve.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  Madam Speaker, I understand we have a few moments before our friends 
arrive for the next discussion.
  I, again, commend the distinguished and passionate gentlewoman from 
Colorado for her really creative work on this legislation.
  I know it means a lot to thousands and thousands of people across the 
country. It is going to make people's lives a lot simpler. The post 
office should be something that facilitates our work in small business, 
our work sending out bills or checks and receiving them, and the post 
office should not be something that gets in the way.
  This legislation will definitely ameliorate a problem that exists, 
and we hope it will facilitate life, commerce, and social action taking 
place in lots of parts of the country.
  This also gives me the opportunity to thank my colleague for engaging 
in this legislative endeavor in a totally bipartisan way. We live in a 
time where partisan feelings are intense and ferocious and, of course, 
that is not historically novel.
  There have been partisan tempers flaring basically since the 
Federalists and the Democratic Republicans went at it in the election 
of the 1800s. I suppose George Washington was the last President who 
actually won a unanimous verdict in the electoral college. He got all 
the electoral college votes. Everybody loved Washington.
  After that, we formed political parties. There is nothing evil about 
political parties. The alternative of having political parties, I 
suppose, is a one-party system something like is developed in China 
with the Communist Party there or in Russia under Vladimir Putin or 
what Orban is working on with illiberal democracy in Hungary.
  There is an easy way to get rid of partisanship if partisanship is 
the problem and that is you get rid of political parties. We can't do 
that because political parties are a sign of health in a society 
because people have different views about things and political parties 
are a great way to articulate different agendas and programs, bring 
them to the electorate, bring them to the voters, and to express 
conflict in a civil and nonviolent way.
  The problem, of course, is when we elevate our devotion to party 
above our devotion to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the 
country as a whole. All of us who aspire and attained a public office 
are nothing but the servants of the people, all the people.
  We might get elected with a little ``R'' next to our name or a ``D'' 
next to our name or an ``I'' next to our name, but once we swear our 
oath of office, we are there to uphold the Constitution for everyone 
and we are there to serve all of the people. That is our job.
  If you say that sounds romantic or that sounds idealistic, actually, 
that is how we conduct most of our lives as politicians. If you come to 
my district office out in beautiful Rockville, Maryland, in the 
beautiful Eighth Congressional District, and you have a problem, let's 
say, with Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid or the post office or 
PPP loans, whatever it is, we will go to bat for you. We will go to 
work for you to help you navigate the twists and turns of the public 
system and Federal bureaucracy.
  We never ask, are you a Democrat? Are you a Republican? Are you an 
Independent? If you are my constituent, we will go to bat for you. I 
know that is true of my friend from Colorado, too. She is there to 
serve everybody: Republicans, Democrats, Independents, others, and 
people who hate all the political parties.
  All of those people are Americans and deserve the programs and the 
services of the government at the very least and certainly all of the 
rights and the freedoms that they are entitled to as Americans under 
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. We have the honor and the 
privilege to serve the people, to serve all America, and to serve the 
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
  We are not the masters of the people. Anybody who occupies public 
office, no matter how high or how low, is nothing but a servant of the 
people. That is

[[Page H6825]]

why the Founders created a system where if people begin to act like 
kings and queens and lords over the people, that is when we throw them 
out through elections or we evict, we eject, we reject, we impeach, we 
convict if we have to do that, but the Constitution has an electoral 
system to keep the process moving.
  All of us are just servants of the people. Just like we are there to 
serve the people, the Federal departments we set up, like the post 
office, which I think still, even with all of the problems, is our most 
popular Federal function. With hundreds of thousands of hardworking, 
devoted people working in the post office, all of them work for the 
government, work for the Congress, which works for the people.
  The three most important words in our Constitution are the three most 
important words in our country, we the people, and we reject every form 
of despotism and dictatorship and anybody who would try to overthrow 
rule by the people.
  In this bill, which may be deceptively simple and may apply only to 
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people in the country, 
what we see is a democratic representative government in action. When 
we are trying to live up to our oaths, we can act in a bipartisan way. 
We can remember where the word ``party'' comes from. It comes from the 
French word ``partie'', which means a part. Each of our parties is 
nothing but a part of the whole.
  When we are doing our jobs right, as Ms. Boebert is today, then we 
are acting in the interest of the whole without regard to political 
party or sect. I am proud to be a part of this legislation, I am proud 
to support it, and I am very hopeful that our friends in the Senate 
will pick it up quickly and we can move it through this Congress.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Miller of Illinois). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert) that 
the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8753, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________

                    INCREASING BASELINE UPDATES ACT

  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 9716) to amend the Congressional Budget and 
Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to require the Congressional Budget 
Office to provide baseline updates, and for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 9716

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing Baseline Updates 
     Act''.

     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE UPDATES TO BASELINE.

       Section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
     Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 602(e)) is amended by adding at 
     the end the following:
       ``(4)(A) The Director shall, to the extent practicable, 
     submit to the Committees on the Budget of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate at least two updates to the 
     baseline submitted under paragraph (1). At least one of the 
     updates shall include economic data used by the Director to 
     calculate such update.
       ``(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit 
     the Director from providing any other update to the baseline 
     during such year.''.

     SEC. 3. ANNUAL TECHNICAL BUDGET DATA SUBMISSION BY THE 
                   PRESIDENT.

       Section 1106 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by 
     adding at the end the following:
       ``(d) On or before February 1 of each calendar year, the 
     President shall submit to Congress technical budget data for 
     the fiscal year beginning in the ensuing calendar year, which 
     shall include up-to-date estimates for current year and prior 
     year data and credit reestimates for the current year (as 
     included in the Federal credit supplement of such budget).''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. Moore) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Boyle) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.

                              {time}  1245


                             General Leave

  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 9716.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Utah?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise today in support of my bill, the Increasing Baseline Updates 
Act.
  I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi) for co-leading this 
effort.
  The Increasing Baseline Updates Act would require CBO to produce at 
least two baseline updates per year, including at least one with 
economic data. Currently, under the Budget Act, CBO is required to 
publish its baseline before February 15 of each year, but a specific 
number of baseline updates is not statutorily required.
  As a result, in recent years, CBO has not published updates to the 
baseline later in the calendar year. The last time CBO published a 
baseline update after July was in 2020, and the Office has not 
published three baseline updates in a calendar year since 2019.
  By requiring these two additional baseline updates each year, the 
Increasing Baseline Updates Act will ensure Congress has updated 
information on the most relevant budget and economic figures to better 
inform the appropriations process and other legislative proposals we 
consider later in any given calendar year.
  The bill also ensures CBO will receive the relevant technical data 
from the executive branch by February 1 of each year so CBO can 
complete their baseline in a timely manner.
  I was proud that this bill unanimously passed the Budget Committee 
this past September, with the help of the ranking member from 
Pennsylvania.
  During the 118th Congress, the Budget Committee has been laser 
focused on sounding the alarm about the threat posed to our Nation by 
the debt and deficit crisis in which we find ourselves. This has 
included bipartisan efforts with our Democratic colleagues on reforms 
to bolster improper payment accountability, improve the budget process, 
and shore up our long-term fiscal solvency.
  Critical to our efforts to rein in the Federal debt and deficit is 
providing oversight of CBO to ensure this office is providing Congress 
the most accurate and timely information possible to inform legislative 
efforts.
  There is a sincere desire in a bipartisan way to get after the fiscal 
state of this Nation, and we have seen several proposals emerge. Not 
all of them have passed, but a lot of them have been worked on together 
with my Democratic colleagues on the Budget Committee to accomplish 
things to improve this process. That is what the Increasing Baseline 
Updates Act aims to accomplish.
  We know we have a lot more work to do. We are $36 trillion in debt, 
and we had a staggering $1.8 trillion deficit last fiscal year. We are 
paying more just to service the debt than on our national defense for 
the first time. It is unacceptable, and we must reverse our debt 
culture.
  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 
new Congress on efforts to grow the economy, cut spending, and 
eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. The 
Increasing Baseline Updates Act is a commonsense reform solidifying a 
total of three baseline updates per year to provide Congress with a 
better and more up-to-date sense of fiscal and economic developments, 
while paving the way for a return to regular order.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 9716, the Increasing Baseline Updates Act, a bipartisan measure to 
ensure Congress has the accurate and timely information we need to 
govern responsibly.
  This bill is fairly straightforward. It requires that the 
Congressional Budget

[[Page H6826]]

Office, or CBO, to provide at least two updates to its annual budget 
baseline each year, with one update including the underlying economic 
data. It also ensures the President submits technical budget data to 
Congress by February 1, giving the CBO the tools it needs to fulfill 
its critical role.
  CBO's baseline projections are the foundation for evaluating proposed 
policies. They are the measuring stick for determining how legislation 
will impact our budget and economy. Regular updates ensure we aren't 
working with outdated information.
  Let me emphasize something else. The CBO is nonpartisan. Its mission 
is not Democratic nor Republican. It is simply to provide Congress 
with unbiased, fact-based analysis. For decades--indeed, 50 years, to 
be exact--it has done an outstanding job, consistently delivering 
reliable and transparent baseline updates. However, we cannot ignore 
the fact that some on the other side of the aisle are working to 
undermine this institution.

  Madam Speaker, the numbers don't lie. We may not like CBO reports 
from time to time, but the numbers are the numbers. Instead of facing 
these facts, some, instead, would rather attack the messenger. That is 
wrong, and we can't let that happen. CBO's credibility and independence 
are essential. It must be able to continue to operate free from 
political interference.
  Now, this bill highlights what we can achieve when we work together. 
On the Budget Committee this year, working alongside my friend, 
Chairman Arrington, we have had unprecedented support from the minority 
party to make sure we could achieve bipartisan reforms. This bill is 
further evidence of that. Through real bipartisan collaboration, we 
found a solution. That is why every single member of the Budget 
Committee, all 32 of us, voted to advance the gentleman from Utah's 
bill.
  I thank my colleague, Mr. Moore, for introducing this bill. I, again, 
thank my Republican colleagues. Especially Messrs. Arrington, Estes, 
and Norman, for working with us, and I thank my Democrat colleague, 
Congressman  Tom Suozzi, for his contributions to this effort.
  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 9716, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters and 
statements of support from various organizations and individuals as 
part of H.R. 9716. These include the Economic Policy Innovation Center 
and National Taxpayers Union Foundation.

                            Economic Policy Innovation Center,

                                                December 10, 2024.
     Hon. Jodey Arrington,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Brendan Boyle,
     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Chairman Arrington and Ranking Member Boyle: The 
     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on 
     Taxation (JCT) serve Congress by providing non-partisan 
     analysis. To accomplish this mission, it is essential that 
     Congress and the public have faith in the methodology by 
     which the CBO and the JCT produce their estimates and 
     reports. An important way to improve trust in the 
     Congressional scorekeepers is by increasing transparency 
     through more frequent updates to the baseline and regular 
     releases of economic data.
       H.R. 9716, the Increasing Baseline Updates Act, introduced 
     by Congressman Blake Moore (R-UT-01) would improve the CBO's 
     ability to access data from the Executive Branch. It would 
     also ensure Congress has updated information to use when 
     legislating.
       The bill requires the CBO to submit to Congress at least 
     two updates to the budget and economic baseline each year. 
     The bill further stipulates that the President must submit 
     technical data necessary for the CBO's estimates to Congress 
     ``on or before February 1 of each calendar year.''
       The federal budget process must evolve to confront the 
     serious fiscal challenges of today and tomorrow. The proposed 
     bill ensures access to the accurate and timely information 
     necessary for lawmakers to do their work for the American 
     people.
       We at EPIC applaud your work in improving the federal 
     budget process to enable Congress and the public to be better 
     informed about the true impact of legislation under 
     consideration.
           Sincerely,
                                               Paul Winfree, Ph.D,
     President and CEO.

                                                National Taxpayers


                                             Union Foundation,

                                                December 10, 2024.
       This week, the House of Representatives is poised to take 
     up the Increasing Baseline Updates Act (H.R. 9716) introduced 
     by Rep. Blake Moore (R-UT) and cosponsored by Reps. Thomas 
     Suozzi (D-NY), Ron Estes (R-KS), and Ralph Norman (R-SC). The 
     bill will be considered under suspension on Wednesday. This 
     bipartisan legislation aims to enhance the ability of the 
     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to produce and update its 
     annual budget baseline. Specifically, the bill mandates that 
     the executive branch provide critical data to CBO by February 
     1 and requires CBO to produce at least two updates to its 
     baseline each year. These reforms would ensure lawmakers have 
     access to more timely and accurate fiscal data.


                         what the bill would do

       CBO's annual baseline, a ten-year projection of the budget 
     and economy based largely on current law, is generally 
     published in January or February. It serves as a critical 
     benchmark for evaluating the fiscal impact of legislative 
     proposals. Updates are released in the spring and late summer 
     to reflect changes in enacted laws and economic conditions.
       The baseline is often delayed because Congress and the 
     President do not complete work on the budget in a timely 
     manner. However, it can also be delayed because the White 
     House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not 
     provide key data to CBO as soon as it could. OMB manages and 
     produces the President's annual budget request based on data 
     from across the federal departments and agencies. This data 
     is only made available to CBO at the same time the budget is 
     released to the public.
       The Increasing Baseline Updates Act addresses this issue by 
     requiring OMB to provide relevant technical data to CBO by 
     February 1 each year. This will enable CBO to finalize its 
     budget baseline more quickly. It would also require CBO, to 
     the extent practicable, to provide at least two baseline 
     updates to Congress. In most years, CBO will produce one or 
     two updates, but, under the Increasing Baseline Updates Act, 
     this would become the minimum. More frequent baseline updates 
     would also improve the accuracy of legislative cost 
     estimates, which are measured against the most recent 
     baseline.


               bipartisan support for better budget data

       This bipartisan reform to provide for more timely CBO 
     budget baselines and updates was passed in September by the 
     House Budget Committee with a vote of 32-0. This reform 
     builds on a pair of bills enacted by Congress this fall. The 
     CBO Data Sharing Act (H.R. 7032), introduced by the Budget 
     Committee's Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) and Ranking 
     Member Brendan Boyle (D-PA) and the CBO Data Access Act (S. 
     1549), introduced by Senators Gary Peters (D-MI) and Susan 
     Collins (R-ME). These bills made it easier for CBO to get the 
     budgetary data it needs from federal agencies without 
     needless delays, so that it can produce legislative cost 
     estimates on a shorter timeline.


                               conclusion

       The Increasing Baseline Updates Act is a pragmatic, 
     bipartisan reform that strengthens CBO's ability to provide 
     timely and accurate fiscal data to lawmakers. By expediting 
     the availability of critical technical data and codifying 
     baseline update requirements, this legislation ensures that 
     Congress has the tools it needs to make informed budgetary 
     decisions. As the national debt continues to grow, reforms 
     for improved baselines and cost estimates will help lawmakers 
     make progress towards sound fiscal management and 
     accountability in government.

                                       Vice President of Research.

  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this 
time, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time to close.
  I was waiting for one other speaker, but seeing that he is not here, 
I will conclude this brief discussion.
  I, again, thank everyone who worked tirelessly to make this bill a 
reality. Once again, I extend my gratitude to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. Moore), and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important 
legislation.
  Again, let this be a lesson to all of us, that through bipartisan 
work we can achieve meaningful reforms. I hope that in the new year we 
will continue to build upon the bills that we passed through this 
committee and through this House on a bipartisan basis.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time to close.
  As we close this debate, even if it might have been a little more 
abrupt, it doesn't take away from the impact of something like this. 
That is what happens in this place when we can strike a balance and 
find an opportunity to recognize both the ranking member and the 
chairman of the Budget Committee. That is where a lot of this work on 
budget reform has been done. It has taken countless discussions and 
getting to the right spot, and

[[Page H6827]]

that is the product that we have here today--sensible, reasonable 
reforms that are needed.
  We are going to get an opportunity to hear from CBO more frequently 
as we try to continue to navigate this incredibly difficult fiscal 
situation that we are in. We are in a tough spot.
  The Budget Committee held another hearing just this morning on this 
very subject. We have a responsibility to our constituents and our 
kids' generation to get our finances in check.
  This bill will help Congress get back to regular order and ensure we 
have updated information and the most relevant budget data and economic 
figures as we continue to craft policy.
  I once again thank the Committee for its unanimous support on this 
bill. In order to get to that unanimous support, Ranking Member Boyle 
has been a significant leader in doing that. I thank him and Mr. Suozzi 
for their efforts on this bill.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 9716.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

     coordinated requirements, budget, and acquisition process 
     that results in the development of an approved requirement 
     for each acquisition program or project in a period of not 
     more than six months from the time that the process is 
     initiated. Programs or projects carried out under the 
     authority of this section shall not be subject to the Joint 
     Capabilities Integration and Development System Manual and 
     Department of Defense Directive 5000.01.

     may, in coordination with the users of the good or service to 
     be acquired under such a program or project and the test 
     community, to make trade-offs among life-cycle costs, 
     requirements, and schedules to meet the goals of the program 
     or project.
       ``(D) Each service acquisition executive, acting in 
     coordination with the defense acquisition executive, may 
     serve as the decision authority for a program or project for 
     which the authority under this section is used, or shall 
     delegate such decision authority.

     may seek an expedited waiver from any regulatory requirement, 
     or in the case of a statutory requirement, a waiver from 
     Congress, that the program manager determines adds cost, 
     schedule, or performance delays with little or no value to 
     the management of such program or project.

     systems and programs, shall maintain a list of contractors 
     with a history of poor performance on space procurement 
     contracts.

     Secretary shall place a contractor, which may consist of the 
     entire contracting entity or a specific division of the 
     contracting entity, on the watch list based on a 
     determination made under paragraph (2).
       ``(2)(A) In considering whether to place a contractor on 
     the watch list, the Assistant Secretary shall determine 
     whether there is evidence of any of the following:
       ``(i) Poor performance on one or more space procurement 
     contracts, or award fee scores below 50 percent.

[[Page H6937]]

       ``(ii) Inadequate management, operational or financial

     including unremediated vulnerabilities arising from foreign 
     ownership, control, or influence.
       ``(iv) Any other failure of controls or performance of a 
     nature so serious or compelling as to warrant placement of 
     the contractor on the watch list.

     evidence described in any of clauses (i) through (iv) of 
     subparagraph (A), that the ability of a contractor to 
     responsibly perform is meaningfully impaired, the Assistant 
     Secretary shall place the contractor on the watch list.
       ``(C) The Assistant Secretary shall establish written 
     policies for the consideration of contractors for placement 
     on the watch list, including policies that require that--
       ``(i) contractors proposed for placement on the watch list 
     shall be provided with notice and an opportunity to respond;
       ``(ii) the basis for a final determination placing a 
     contractor on the watch list shall be documented in writing; 
     and
       ``(iii) at the request of a contractor, the contractor 
     shall be removed from the watch list if the Assistant 
     Secretary determines that there is evidence that the issue 
     resulting in placement on the list has been satisfactorily 
     remediated.
       ``(c) Effect of Listing.--(1) The Assistant Secretary may 
     not solicit an offer from, award a contract to, consent to a 
     subcontract with, execute a grant, cooperative agreement, or 
     other transaction with, or exercise an option on any space 
     procurement contract with, an entity included on the watch 
     list unless the Assistant Secretary makes a written 
     determination that there is a compelling reason to do so.

     makes a determination under paragraph (1), the Assistant 
     Secretary shall notify the congressional defense committees 
     and the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension

     be construed as preventing the suspension or debarment of a 
     contractor, but inclusion on the watch list shall not be 
     construed as a punitive measure or de facto suspension or 
     debarment of a contractor.

                   DETERRENCE.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the considered use of artificial intelligence and 
     machine learning tools presents opportunities to strengthen 
     the security of critical strategic communications and early 
     warning networks, improve the efficiency of planning 
     processes to reduce the risk of collateral damage, and 
     enhance U.S. capabilities for modeling weapons functionality 
     in support of stockpile stewardship; and
       (2) even with such applications, particular care must be 
     taken to ensure that the incorporation of artificial 
     intelligence and machine learning tools does not increase the 
     risk that our Nation's most critical strategic assets can be 
     compromised.
       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
     States that the use of artificial intelligence efforts should 
     not compromise the integrity of nuclear safeguards, whether 
     through the functionality of weapons systems, the validation 
     of communications from command authorities, or the principle 
     of requiring positive human actions in execution of decisions 
     by the President with respect to the employment of nuclear 
     weapons.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war 
     against Germany. As a historically neutral nation, the United 
     States was unprepared to fight a technologically modern 
     conflict overseas. The United States called upon American 
     Telephone and Telegraph (referred to in this section as 
     ``AT&T'') to provide equipment and trained personnel for the 
     Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T executives in Army uniform 
     served at home under the provisions of the Act entitled ``An 
     Act for making further and more effectual provision for the 
     national defense, and for other purposes.'', approved June 3, 
     1916 (referred to in this section as the ``National Defense 
     Act of 1916''), which allowed for the induction of 
     individuals with specialized skills into a reserve force.
       (2) When General John Pershing sailed for Europe in May of 
     1917, as head of the American Expeditionary Forces (referred 
     to in this section as the ``AEF''), he took telephone 
     operating equipment with him in recognition of the inadequacy 
     of European circuitry and with the understanding that 
     telephones would play a key role in battlefield 
     communications for the first time in the history of war.
       (3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF struggled to 
     develop the telephone service necessary for the Army to 
     function under battlefield conditions. Monolingual 
     infantrymen from the United States were unable to connect 
     calls rapidly or communicate effectively with their French 
     counterparts to put calls through over toll lines that linked 
     one region of the country with another. The Army found that 
     the average male operator required 60 seconds to make a 
     connection. That rate was unacceptably slow, especially for 
     operational calls between command outposts and the front 
     lines.
       (4) During this time, in the United States, telephone 
     operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired for their speed 
     in connecting calls, women filled 85 percent of the telephone 
     operating positions in the United States. It took the average 
     female operator 10 seconds to make a connection.
       (5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing cabled the War 
     Department and wrote, ``On account of the great difficulty of 
     obtaining properly qualified men, request organization and 
     dispatch to France a force of women telephone operators all 
     speaking French and English equally well.''. To begin, 
     General Pershing requested 100 women under the command of a 
     commissioned captain, writing that ``All should have 
     allowances of Army nurses and should be uniformed.''.
       (6) The War Department sent press releases to newspapers 
     across the United States to recruit women willing to serve 
     for the duration of the war and face the hazards of submarine 
     warfare and aerial bombardment. These articles emphasized 
     that patriotic women would be ``full-fledged soldier[s] under 
     the articles of war'' and would ``do as much to help win the 
     war as the men in khaki who go `over the top.' ''. All women 
     selected would take the Army oath.
       (7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 100 positions 
     described in paragraph (5) and the first recruits took the 
     Army oath on January 15, 1918.
       (8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female Signal 
     Corps members had relative rather than traditional ranks and 
     were ranked as Operator, Supervisor, or Chief Operator. When 
     promoted, the women were required to swear the Army oath 
     again.
       (9) Telephone operators were the first women to serve as 
     soldiers in non-medical classifications and the job of the 
     operators was to help win the war, not to mitigate the harms 
     of the war. In popular parlance, they were known as the 
     ``Hello Girls''.
       (10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uniforms and Army 
     insignia always, as well as standard-issue identity disks in 
     case of death, and were subject to court martial for 
     infractions of the military code.
       (11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and their immediate 
     officers, the legal counsel of the Army ruled internally on 
     March 20, 1918, that the women were not actually soldiers but 
     contract employees, even though the women had not seen or 
     signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for the 
     induction of men and the code remained unchanged despite the 
     orders of General Pershing. Nevertheless, legal counsel also 
     recognized that the National Defense Act of 1916, which 
     allowed for the induction of members of the telephone 
     industry of the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed 
     no gender restrictions.
       (12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the first 
     contingent of operators began their official duties in 
     France. The operators arrived before most infantrymen of the 
     Armed Forces in order to facilitate logistics and deployment 
     and spent their first night in Paris under German 
     bombardment.
       (13) After the arrival of the operators, telephone service 
     in France improved immediately, as calls tripled from 13,000 
     to 36,000 per day.
       (14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and deployed 5 
     additional contingents of female Signal Corps operators. With 
     these personnel, calls increased to 150,000 per day.
       (15) In addition to standard telephone operating, bilingual 
     Signal Corps members provided simultaneous translation 
     between officers from France and officers from the United 
     States, who were communicating by telephone.
       (16) The AEF fought their first major battles in the last 2 
     months of the war. By that point, the Signal Corps considered 
     the contributions of women to be so essential that, in 
     telephone exchanges closest to the front line, the Army 
     exclusively used women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the 
     rear, the Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave 
     male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone traffic was 
     slower.
       (17) Seven bilingual operators--
       (A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne 
     under the immediate command of General Pershing;
       (B) staffed the Operations Boards through which orders to 
     advance, fire, and retreat were delivered to soldiers in the 
     trenches, to artillery units on alert, and to pilots awaiting 
     orders at French airfields; and
       (C) were awarded a ``Defensive Sector Clasp'' for the 
     Meuse-Argonne operation.
       (18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello Girls, Grace 
     Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was awarded the Distinguished 
     Service Medal. Out of 16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, 
     Banker was one of only 18 individuals so honored.
       (19) Thirty additional operators received special 
     commendations, many signed by General Pershing himself, for 
     ``exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous services'' in 
     ``Advance Sections'' of the conflict.
       (20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As of that date, 
     223 female operators served in France and had connected 
     26,000,000 calls for the AEF.
       (21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Signal Corps 
     wrote in his official report 2 days after the date on which 
     the war ended that ``a large part of the success of the 
     communications of this Army is due to . . . a competent staff 
     of women operators.''.
       (22) After the war ended, some women were ordered to 
     Coblenz in Germany for the occupation of that country and to 
     Paris for the Paris Peace Treaty of 1919 to continue 
     telephone operations, sometimes in direct support of 
     President Woodrow Wilson.

[[Page H7058]]

       (23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez Crittenden, 
     died in France in the service of the United States and were 
     buried there in military cemeteries with military ceremonies. 
     Those operators died of the same influenza pandemic that 
     killed more soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat 
     operations.
       (24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were ineligible for 
     discharge until formal release. Because of their role in 
     logistics, those women were among the last soldiers to come 
     home to the United States. The last Signal Corps operators 
     returned from France in January of 1920.
       (25) Upon arrival in the United States, the Army informed 
     female veterans that they had performed as civilians, not 
     soldiers, even though operators had served in Army uniform in 
     a theater of war surrounded by men who were similarly 
     engaged.
       (26) Despite the objections of General George Squier, the 
     top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, the Army denied 
     Signal Corps women the veterans' benefits granted to male 
     soldiers and female nurses, such as--
       (A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred in the line 
     of duty;
       (B) cash bonuses;
       (C) soldiers' pensions;
       (D) flags on their coffins; and
       (E) the Victory Medals promised them in France.
       (27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led by Merle 
     Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress more than 50 times for 
     their recognition. In 1977, under the sponsorship of Senator 
     Barry Goldwater, Congress passed legislation to retroactively 
     acknowledge the military service of the Women's Airforce 
     Service Pilots (referred to in this section as ``WASPs'') of 
     World War II and ``the service of any person in any other 
     similarly situated group the members of which rendered 
     service to the Armed Forces of the United States in a 
     capacity considered civilian employment or contractual 
     service at the time such service was rendered''.
       (28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed 
     the legislation described in paragraph (27) into law as the 
     GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 91 Stat. 
     1433).
       (29) The Signal Corps telephone operators applied for, and 
     were granted, status as veterans in 1979.
       (30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned home after 
     the war were still alive to receive their Victory Medals and 
     official discharge papers, which were finally awarded in 
     1979.
       (31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Massachusetts, 
     returned to the United States after the war, where she worked 
     on the professional staff of Congresswoman Edith Nourse 
     Rogers. Shaw lived to receive her honorable discharge and was 
     the first burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery 
     opened on October 11, 1980. Shaw's uniform is on display at 
     the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, 
     Missouri.
       (32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at a ceremony 
     in her home in Marine City, Michigan, ``Hello Girl'' Oleda 
     Joure Christides raised the paper to her lips and kissed it. 
     The only thing Christides ever wanted from the Federal 
     Government was a flag on her coffin.
       (33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into 
     law Public Law 111-40 (123 Stat. 1958), which awarded the 
     WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal for their service to the 
     United States.
       (34) For their role as pioneers who paved the way for all 
     women in uniform, and for service that was essential to 
     victory in World War I, the ``Hello Girls'' merit similar 
     recognition.
       (b) Congressional Gold Medal.--
       (1) Award authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate 
     shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf 
     of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in 
     honor of the female telephone operators of the Army Signal 
     Corps (commonly known as the ``Hello Girls''), in recognition 
     of those operators'--
       (A) pioneering military service;
       (B) devotion to duty; and
       (C) 60-year struggle for--
       (i) recognition as soldiers; and
       (ii) veterans' benefits.
       (2) Design and striking.--For the purposes of the award 
     described in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury

       (3) Smithsonian institution.--
       (A) In general.--After the award of the gold medal under 
     paragraph (1), the medal shall be given to the Smithsonian 
     Institution, where the medal shall be available for display, 
     as appropriate, and made available for research.
       (B) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal 
     received under subparagraph (A) available elsewhere, 
     particularly at--
       (i) appropriate locations associated with--

       (I) the Army Signal Corps;
       (II) the Women in Military Service for America Memorial;
       (III) the U.S. Army Women's Museum; and
       (IV) the National World War I Museum and Memorial; and

       (ii) any other location determined appropriate by the 
     Smithsonian Institution.
       (c) Duplicate Medals.--Under such regulations as the 
     Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell 
     duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under 
     subsection (b) at a price sufficient to cover the costs of 
     the medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of 
     machinery, and overhead expenses.
       (d) National Medals.--
       (1) National medals.--Medals struck under this section are 
     national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, 
     United States Code.
       (2) Numismatic items.--For purposes of section 5134 of 
     title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this 
     Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.
       (e) Authority to Use Fund Amounts; Proceeds of Sale.--
       (1) Authority to use fund amounts.--There is authorized to 
     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise 
     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of 
     the medals struck under this Act.
       (2) Proceeds of sale.--Amounts received from the sale of 
     duplicate bronze medals authorized under subsection (c) shall 
     be deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise 
     Fund.

     covered employee of the Department of Defense, made one or

                     TITLE LXXI--WORKFORCE MATTERS

     SEC. 7101. COMPETITIVE LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the effectiveness and stability of United States 
     foreign missions are linked to the dedication and expertise 
     of locally employed staff; and
       (2) ensuring competitive compensation packages benchmarked 
     against the local market is essential not only to retain 
     valuable talent but also to reflect a commitment to 
     employment practices abroad.

     SEC. 7102. STRATEGY FOR TARGETED RECRUITMENT OF CIVIL 
                   SERVANTS.

       Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate 
     congressional committees and the Committee on Appropriations 
     of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives a strategy for targeted and 
     proactive recruitment to fill open civil service positions, 
     focusing on recruiting from schools or organizations, and on 
     platforms targeting those with relevant expertise related to 
     such positions.

     SEC. 7103. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) Foreign Service personnel at the Department serve with 
     distinction in austere places and under challenging 
     conditions around the world with limited healthcare 
     availability;
       (2) the use of paper medical records, which require Foreign 
     Service personnel to carry files containing protected health 
     information from post to post, limits the availability of 
     their health information to Department medical personnel 
     during critical health incidents;
       (3) electronic medical records are necessary, particularly 
     as the Department opens new embassies in the South Pacific, 
     thousands of miles from the nearest Department medical 
     officer, who may not have access to up-to-date personnel 
     medical files;
       (4) the lack of electronic medical records is even more 
     important for mental health records, as the Department only 
     has a small number of regional medical officer psychiatrists 
     and relies heavily on telehealth for most Foreign Service 
     personnel; and
       (5) due to the critical need for electronic medical 
     records, it is imperative that the Department address the 
     situation quickly and focus on secure commercially available 
     or other successful systems utilized by public and private 
     sector organizations with a track record of successfully 
     implementing large-scale projects of this type.
       (b) Electronic Medical Records Requirement.--Not later than 
     December 31, 2027, the Secretary shall have fully implemented 
     an electronic medical records process or system for all 
     Foreign Service personnel and their Eligible Family Members 
     that eliminates reliance on paper medical records and 
     includes appropriate safeguards to protect personal privacy.
       (c) Report on Implementation.--
       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the 
     Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
     committees and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate 
     and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
     Representatives a report on the progress made towards meeting 
     the requirement under subsection (b).
       (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
     shall include the following elements:
       (A) An updated timeline for implementation.
       (B) An estimated completion date.
       (C) The amounts expended to date on the required electronic 
     medical records system.
       (D) The estimated amount needed to complete the system.
       (3) Termination of requirement.--
       (A) In general.--The reporting requirement under paragraph 
     (1) shall cease upon the earlier of--
       (i) notification to the appropriate congressional 
     committees that electronic medical records have been 
     completely implemented for all Foreign Service personnel; and
       (ii) the date that is 5 years after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act.
       (B) Report required in case of non-implementation.--If the 
     Department has not completely implemented electronic medical 
     records within 5 years of the date of the enactment of this 
     Act, the final report submitted under paragraph (1) shall 
     include an explanation for the lack of completion and steps 
     the Department will take to finalize the electronic medical 
     records process.

     SEC. 7104. PORTABILITY OF PROFESSIONAL LICENSES.

       (a) In General.--Chapter 9 of the Foreign Service Act of 
     1980 (22 U.S.C. 4081 et seq.) is amended by adding after

     be considered valid at a similar scope of practice and in the 
     discipline applied for in the jurisdiction of such new

     such member of the Foreign Service or spouse--
       ``(1) provides a copy of the member's notification of

     which the new residency is located;
       ``(2) remains in good standing with--
       ``(A) the licensing authority that issued the covered 
     license; and
       ``(B) every other licensing authority that has issued to 
     the member of the Foreign Service or spouse a license valid 
     at a similar scope of practice and in the discipline applied 
     in the jurisdiction of such licensing authority; and
       ``(3) submits to the authority of the licensing authority 
     in the new jurisdiction for the purposes of standards of 
     practice, discipline, and fulfillment of any continuing 
     education requirements.
       ``(b) Interstate Licensure Compacts.--If a member of the 
     Foreign Service or spouse of a member of the Foreign Service 
     is licensed and able to operate in multiple jurisdictions 
     through an interstate licensure compact, with respect to 
     services provided in the jurisdiction of the interstate 
     licensure compact by a licensee covered by such compact, the 
     member of the Foreign Service or spouse of a member of the 
     Foreign Service shall be subject to the requirements of the 
     compact or the applicable provisions of law of the applicable 
     State and not this section.
       ``(c) Covered License Defined.--In this section, the term 
     `covered license' means a professional license or 
     certificate--
       ``(1) that is in good standing with the licensing authority 
     that issued such professional license or certificate;
       ``(2) that the member of the Foreign Service or spouse of a 
     member of the Foreign Service has actively used during the 
     two years immediately preceding the relocation described in 
     subsection (a); and
       ``(3) that is not a license to practice law.''.
       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section 2 
     of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended by inserting 
     after the item relating to section 908 the following new

     elects to continue coverage pursuant to subsection (a) for 
     longer than 365 days, the employee shall be responsible for

     share) during such longer period.

       (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall modernize the 
     Foreign Service bidding process, and should consider 
     incorporating the following elements:
       (1) A stable-pair matching, preference-ranking system for 
     non-directed Foreign Service employees and hiring bureaus, 
     allowing for a more strategic alignment of workforce and 
     resources.
       (2) Incorporation of lessons learned from the previous 
     stable-pair matching bidding pilot framework referred to as 
     ``iMatch'' but applied more expansively to include non-
     directed assignments up through FS-01 positions, taking 
     advantage of efficiency benefits such as tandem assignment 
     functionalities.
       (3) Mechanisms to ensure transparency, efficiency, 
     effectiveness, accountability, and flexibility in the 
     assignment process, while maintaining equal opportunities for 
     all employees in the Foreign Service.
       (4) An independent auditing process to ensure adherence to 
     established rules, effectiveness in meeting the Department's 
     needs, and prevention of bias or manipulation, including 
     through the use of protected categories in making assignment 
     decisions.
       (b) Consideration of Certain Promotion Issues.--In parallel 
     with assignment process modernization efforts, the Secretary 
     shall--
       (1) assess whether any point systems tied to promotion 
     incentives should consider service in hard-to-fill or 
     critical positions; and

     process into winter and summer cycles is necessary or 
     efficient compared to stable matching processes.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) Increasing the United States' global diplomatic 
     footprint is imperative to advance United States' national 
     security interests, particularly in the face of a massive 
     diplomatic expansion of our strategic competitors.

     small island nations where there is no United States 
     Government presence, but one is needed to advance United 
     States strategic objectives.

     for success upon opening to allow diplomats to focus on 
     advancing United States national interests in-country.
       (4) The United States can and should move more swiftly to 
     open new diplomatic missions and provide United States 
     diplomats and locally employed staff with a workplace that 
     meets locally appropriate quality, safety, and security 
     standards.
       (5) To do this, the Department must streamline and support 
     the process of opening new posts to identify efficiencies and 
     remove obstacles that are unduly complicating the opening of 
     new diplomatic missions, particularly in small island states 
     and similarly situated locations.

     such diplomatic missions the needed resources and authorities

     moment United States personnel arrive, or even before the 
     opening of a new mission, particularly in small island 
     nations.

     the post's functions or physical platform after opening, 
     should that be needed;
       (J) any other authorities or processes that may be required 
     to successfully and quickly stand up a new diplomatic 
     mission, including any new authorities the Department may 
     need;
       (K) a list of incentives, in addition to pay differentials, 
     being considered for such posts;

                             General Leave

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 5009 and that I may include tabular material on the 
same.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Alabama?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5009. For the first 
time in decades, this year's defense bill carries a different name. It 
is the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense 
Authorization Act. We did that to underscore the tremendous gains this 
bill makes toward improving the quality of life of our servicemembers 
and their families.
  No servicemember should have to live in squalid conditions. No 
military family should have to rely on food stamps to feed their 
children. No one serving in the military should have to wait to see a 
doctor. That is exactly what many of our servicemembers are 
experiencing, especially junior enlisted personnel.
  This bill goes a long way to fixing that. It includes a 15 percent 
pay raise for the junior enlisted. It expands allowances for housing 
and food. The bill significantly increases funding to improve existing 
barracks and build new ones. It encourages the services to pursue 
public-private partnerships to provide better unaccompanied housing.
  The bill reduces dangerous healthcare wait times by waiving referral 
requirements for specialty care and expanding the number of DOD doctors 
and nurses with new special recruitment and pay incentives.
  The bill improves access to childcare for military families by 
increasing investment in DOD childcare centers and fully funding 
childcare fee assistance programs.
  The bill helps military spouses gain and retain employment by making 
it easier for them to transfer professional licenses between States.
  We are making these historic improvements in the quality of life of 
our servicemembers because, now more than ever, we need to recruit and 
retain the best and the brightest. That is because the threats our 
Nation faces, especially those from China, are more complex now than 
they have been in over 40 years.
  To deter these threats, the FY25 NDAA reforms acquisition authorities 
and fosters private-sector innovation to speed the fielding of game-
changing new technologies that will give us the advantage in a conflict 
with China. It strengthens our security partnerships with Taiwan and 
our Pacific allies. It fully funds the modernization of our nuclear 
deterrent; protects U.S. military bases, the defense supply chain, and 
academic research from Chinese espionage; and builds the logistics 
networks in the Pacific the military needs to carry out operations 
against China. It includes new investments to retool and revitalize the 
industrial base to ensure it can deliver the systems we need to prevail 
in any conflict.
  In the face of growing threats from China, it is also critical we 
restore the military's focus on lethality. The FY25 NDAA does so by 
ending divisive policies that have hurt recruiting, unit cohesion, and 
military readiness.
  We all know that deterring these threats will be an expensive 
endeavor. That is why this bill includes over $30 billion in savings 
from cutting systems that can't survive a conflict with China and by 
reining in programs like the F-35 that are not delivering on existing 
requirements.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill and a fair compromise that will go a 
long way to ensure our Nation can successfully deter and defeat any 
adversary.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, below is a table representing $31.6 billion in savings 
over the Future Years Defense Program included in the Servicemember 
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2025.

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.
  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank Chairman Rogers for his 
outstanding leadership of the committee this year and in past years. He 
has done a great job of setting an example for bipartisan leadership in 
working this process all the way through to produce the product that we 
have before us today.
  I thank the members of the House committee, both Republicans and 
Democrats, and all the staff. We have a very focused spirit on that 
committee that says we are not going to focus on partisanship. We are 
going to focus on getting the job done and getting the bill done.
  Second, I think this process has been really good. We went through 
the normal process of hearing the bill in committee, with all kinds of 
amendments and debates that lasted a while. We did the same thing in 
the Rules Committee. We went to conference and produced what is an 
outstanding product in many, many respects. The chairman highlighted 
some of them.
  Of the priorities that we have, number one is trying to make sure 
that we can recruit the best and the brightest to serve in our military 
and, crucially, that we support them.
  The chairman did a great job of describing what is the best part of 
this bill this year, and that is the result of our commission, our task 
force, I guess, that we formed on quality of life in the military, ably 
led by   Don Bacon on the Republican side and Chrissy Houlahan on our 
side, to produce a whole lot of the programs that the chairman 
mentioned. They are in there. That is crucially important.
  We also have a couple of major problems in meeting our national 
security needs on production of the munitions and crucial equipment 
that we need. This bill attempts to address that and to expand our 
capacity.
  To meet that need and to meet other needs, we also need our partners 
and allies. There are a number of provisions in this bill that 
strengthen those alliances on things like AUKUS, the European Defense 
Initiative, and the Indo-Pacific defense initiative. We do a great job 
of that.
  Lastly is the big issue on technology, making the Pentagon get better 
at quickly buying innovative new technologies, particularly software, 
that we need to succeed.
  Overall, that package is terrific. There is one problem, which is 
that a political partisan wedge issue was insisted on being included in 
this bill at the insistence of Republican leadership, not of the Armed 
Services Committee. I think it is really problematic.
  The language seems somewhat benign. It basically says that minors 
experiencing gender dysphoria will not be allowed to receive any care 
that could lead to sterilization. The problem is this is denying 
healthcare to minors who clearly need it.
  The ``could'' language is very problematic because, as we all know, 
anyone who has watched the last 15 seconds of any pharmaceutical ad, if 
you take any medical treatment, a lot of bad things could happen. The 
medical profession is always very careful about explaining all those 
things to you.
  This could restrict the ability of minors experiencing gender 
dysphoria access to puberty blockers, access to hormone treatment 
therapy, access to critical care that they need, and for no good 
reason.
  Now, look, there is a reasonable question about what care minors 
should receive in this area. We had floated the idea that if you want 
to look at this, you want to ask the medical profession what they 
think, what the studies said about when this care is appropriate, but 
we didn't do that. We have an outright ban on care that undoubtedly is 
saving lives of minors experiencing gender dysphoria and the anxiety, 
depression, and suicidal thoughts that come with that.
  Just today, I got a phone call from a constituent, a daughter now 19 
whose parents were in the military service. She received this type of 
care when she was 10, 11, 12, 13 years old. She believes that it saved 
her life. We are now going to deny that care.
  Let me tell you, the treatments for minors with anxiety and 
depression are very controversial, not just in the trans community. It 
is the trans community that we choose to focus on for partisan 
political reasons.
  I have concerns, having gone through an anxiety problem myself, with 
the number of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications that are 
prescribed to minors. I think, in some instances, it is overprescribed 
and too quickly, but the other thing I know is that there are some 
minors who benefit enormously from that treatment.
  I would never in a million years present a piece of legislation 
outright banning that treatment from any minor, yet that is what we do 
here. We are doing it because of ignorant, bigoted reasons against the 
trans community.
  The medical profession has no dispute that, in some instances, this 
treatment is crucial to the health and well-being of our children, and 
we are now denying that to the children of servicemembers.
  I think that is problematic, and I hope we will rethink it and remove 
that from this bill because it taints an otherwise excellent piece of 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), my friend and colleague who 
chaired the task force and worked hand in hand with Representative 
Houlahan from Pennsylvania in fashioning the 32 recommendations for the 
quality of life improvements that are embedded in this bill.
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense 
Authorization Act.
  The 2025 NDAA prioritizes the servicemembers and military families 
who protect and defend the United States by making their quality of 
life the cornerstone of this legislation.
  I had the honor of serving as the chairman of the committee's 
bipartisan military Quality of Life Panel side by side with my friend, 
Ranking Member Houlahan, and other distinguished members of this 
committee.

  I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for their support of 
our efforts and for their deep commitment to improving the quality of 
life for the men, women, and families who serve.
  As a result of the tireless efforts of our members, the professional 
staff, and the personal staff, the legislation

[[Page H7092]]

before us delivers the most comprehensive military quality of life 
reforms in the history of this country. It includes a 14.5 percent pay 
raise for our junior enlisted members, a 4.5 percent pay raise for the 
rest of the force, improvements for the Basic Needs Allowance and cost 
of living allowances, improvements to unaccompanied and military family 
housing, and far-reaching reforms to expand access to medical care and 
childcare and to improve support to military spouses.
  In addition, this year, I was able to serve as the chairman of the 
Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee. The 2025 
NDAA advances the DOD's offensive and defensive posture in cyberspace 
and ensures our warfighters are equipped with the most modern and 
lethal technologies in the world.
  I am grateful that several of my provisions were included in the 
final legislation, including the elevation of the Joint Force 
Headquarters-Department of Defense Information Networks to a sub-
unified command within the U.S. Cyber Command and the establishment of 
the Department of Defense Hackathon program.
  In addition, this bill includes needed hiring authorities for DOD's 
innovation enterprise, including DARPA, DIU, SCO, and SDA, which will 
ensure that the Department of Defense has access to the best and 
brightest technical talent.
  Mr. Speaker, the 2025 NDAA is a strong defense bill that prioritizes 
our national security, all of those men and women who serve, and their 
families, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

                              {time}  1515

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), the ranking member of the 
House Committee on Armed Services' Panel on Quality of Life.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member 
Smith both for their leadership and clear vision for our committee, 
which has guided our national security and collective defense.
  This Congress, I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member 
our military Quality of Life Panel alongside my dear friend and 
Republican colleague, Representative   Don Bacon of Nebraska.
  The bill before us today, including more than 20 provisions from that 
Quality of Life Panel, is truly a testament to what this body can 
accomplish when we come together and when we do hard work together.
  From inadequate pay and substandard housing conditions to food 
insecurity and long wait times for essential services, our panel's 
findings make it clear that we still have a lot of work to do to ensure 
that our military families survive and thrive.
  I am very pleased that the fiscal year NDAA includes a 14.5 percent 
pay raise for most junior enlisted and a 4.5 percent pay raise for all 
servicemembers. This increase is critical for us to retain our all-
volunteer enlisted forces and maximize the investments we have made in 
them.
  It also includes key healthcare provisions, like no-cost 
contraception and my bill, the MOMS Who Serve Act, which is the largest 
investment in maternal health in the DOD's history.
  It requires the DOD to fully fund overdue maintenance for housing and 
fee assistance for childcare so that no family is turned away. It 
ensures that our spouses have the support they need to ensure pathways 
to employment and transfer licenses for careers when they move.
  This is the most consequential and important piece of legislation of 
the entire 118th Congress. With this bill in law, our Nation will be 
more secure and our servicemen and -women more resolved to face the 
global challenges of tomorrow.
  I would be remiss if I closed without noting my severe disappointment 
in those colleagues who chose to sully this bill with political culture 
wars that will impact the healthcare of minors. This is not what we 
were tasked to do, and I urge us to remain focused and of service.
  Young America, the next generation of our all-volunteer force, and 
their families are watching, and our national security depends on it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Intelligence and Special Operations.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025. I thank Chairman Rogers and 
Ranking Member Smith for their leadership in bringing this critical 
piece of bipartisan legislation for the national security of our Nation 
to the floor for the 64th consecutive year.
  This bill continues to provide resources and capabilities to counter 
our Nation's number one threat, China.
  The bill accomplishes this by ensuring the Defense Intelligence 
Enterprise, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and our Special 
Operations Forces have the tools required to execute the Department's 
efforts in strategic competition and in countering malign Chinese 
actions.
  This NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a methodology 
that ensures strategic competition is part of force sizing analysis, 
enhances intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities, requires 
more frequent biodefense posture reviews to ensure we can defeat and 
prevent biothreats, and authorizes the Taiwan Security Cooperation 
Initiative to enable Taiwan to maintain self-defense capabilities.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a critically important bill, and I urge all my 
colleagues to support it.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of Seapower, I thank all 
of its members for their input crafting this year's National Defense 
Authorization Act. I also salute my friend and outstanding chairman of 
the subcommittee, Trent Kelly, for his work crafting our bipartisan 
mark. I have a larger written statement which details our work, which I 
will submit for the Record, and I will use my time today on the issue 
which consumed the bulk of our time, namely the Virginia-class attack 
submarine program.
  Mr. Speaker, the U.S. attack submarine fleet stands as our unmatched 
strategic advantage against any adversary across the globe. There is 
overwhelming consensus in Congress, Navy, and industry that we need to 
expand output for our own fleet and to satisfy our Nation's commitments 
to the AUKUS security agreement. Despite the slowdown caused by COVID, 
there are promising signs of the industry's recovery.
  In 2024, the Navy commissioned the USS New Jersey, the 23rd Virginia 
sub, and will receive delivery of the USS Iowa next week. Next year, 
the Navy will take delivery of the USS Massachusetts and USS Idaho, the 
25th and 26th boats in the class.
  This bill recognizes this progress and rejects the Navy's woefully 
inadequate budget request, which would undermine procurement stability 
that is essential to growing the program's supply chain.
  Simply put, to meet our strategic goals, we have no other choice than 
to move forward with a strong demand signal. Final language in this 
bill uses incremental authority to fund a second Virginia submarine and 
provides additional authorities that will allow shipyards to boost 
wages, a critical step to increase recruitment and retention among the 
metal trades workforce.
  This is not pie in the sky. Indeed, just last month, OMB and the Navy 
belatedly acknowledged our committee's stance and sent over a 
supplemental request to Congress of nearly $6 billion for the Virginia-
class submarine program. It is our hope that, with this bill and the 
supplemental request, the Navy and industry can achieve an even higher 
production cadence and execute the long overdue next block contract for 
the program.

  This bill truly carries out our constitutional duty in Article 1, 
Section 8, ``to provide and maintain a Navy.''
  I thank our subcommittee staff, Phil MacNaughton, Ian Bennitt, Kelly 
Goggin, Kyle Noyes, and Ethan Pelissier, for their work in crafting 
this product.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.

[[Page H7093]]

  

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 5009, the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY25. This legislation is 
crucial for enhancing our national security, improving the quality of 
life for our servicemembers, and ensuring the readiness of our Armed 
Forces.
  I thank Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Smith, my good friend, 
Ranking Member   Joe Courtney, and the members of the Committee on 
Seapower and Projection Forces for their dedication. Your commitment is 
crucial to maintaining the strength and maritime superiority of 
America's Navy.
  Today, we face significant threats from adversaries that seek to 
disrupt global peace, including China's military expansion and coercive 
tactics that post a direct threat to the stability and security of the 
Indo-Pacific region. To counter this threat, we need to maintain the 
strongest and most formidable naval and projection forces on the 
planet.
  This legislation addresses these concerns directly and provides 
authority to incrementally fund construction of a second Virginia-class 
submarine in FY25, reinforcing our undersea dominance and providing 
critical, strategic deterrence. Additionally, it supports six battle 
force ships, invests in the shipyard industrial base, and demands 
consistency in the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, allowing industry 
to invest with confidence.
  Importantly, this bill meets the congressionally mandated floor of 31 
amphibious ships and authorizes funding for a domestic new-build 
sealift program.
  I am proud to say this bill recognizes the critical role of our 
National Guard and Reserves. It strengthens their readiness through 
expanded training opportunities and equipment modernization, ensuring 
they remain a capable and responsive force both at home and abroad.
  I am really proud that it gives a 14.5 percent pay raise to our 
junior enlisted, who are in dire need of this, and 4.5 percent for all 
others. It also authorizes substantial funding to tackle housing 
maintenance, construct new housing units, and renovate barracks.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the ranking member of the 
House Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land 
Forces.
  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member 
Smith for their continued leadership in bringing this bill to the 
floor. I also certainly thank the members of the subcommittee.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill continues the long, proud tradition of 
bipartisan work by the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces and 
is the result of our commitment to work together to find the best 
solutions to manage the Nation's military.
  I especially thank our chairman, Mr.  Rob Wittman, and his staff for 
their support in building this strong, bipartisan bill.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill carefully addresses affordability and 
achievability of current and future modernization requirements.
  At the same time it continues the oversight necessary to ensure a 
responsible execution of these programs, including: the tactical 
aircraft programs; the ISR, which is the intelligence, surveillance, 
and reconnaissance aircraft; and the oversight of the services' force 
design strategies and modernization priorities.
  This bill also includes the subcommittee's multiyear effort to manage 
the largest acquisition program in the history of the Department, the 
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In this bill, it provides strong legislative 
mandates to ensure the Department and its industrial partners deliver 
the aircraft that the services are paying for: the TR-3/Block-4 version 
of the F-35.
  Critically important is what we started 5 years ago, to identify and 
buy down modernization and safety risks in our munitions industrial 
base.
  In addition, this bill provides much-needed support for our 
warfighters, a 14.5 percent pay raise.
  I certainly want to take a moment to thank our staff members who have 
been instrumental in bringing this to the floor: Jay Vallario, Dave 
Sienicki, Heath Bope, and Michael Kirlin. I also thank my staff, Sam 
Devito and Robin Dickey.
  Unfortunately, despite all the bipartisan achievements, after 64 
years, we are deciding to jam into it a partisan wedge. I am sad to see 
these political games.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Strategic Forces.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong favor of the fiscal 
year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill makes long-
overdue improvements for the well-being of our servicemembers as well 
as underwriting our national defense at a time when we face a 
tumultuous global security environment.
  It has been my honor to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Strategic Forces, which oversees our Nation's nuclear enterprise, 
missile defense forces, and national defense space capabilities. I am 
pleased that my subcommittee continued the tradition of 
bipartisan work, and I thank Ranking Member Seth Moulton for his 
partnership.

  Mr. Speaker, our nuclear deterrent is the foundation of our national 
security. This bill fully funds the modernization of our nuclear triad, 
including key investments in submarine construction, developing the 
nuclear sea-launched cruise missile, and maintaining adequate numbers 
of intercontinental ballistic missiles, all to keep pace with growing 
Chinese and Russian nuclear threats.
  This bill also authorizes important resources to restore nuclear 
production infrastructure maintained by the National Nuclear Security 
Administration.
  This year, the actions of our enemies revealed the importance of 
having strong integrated missile defense capabilities. To that end, 
this bill reverses the damaging Biden administration's decision to 
cease production of the Standard Missile-3 Block 1B. This very missile 
saved countless lives when Iran twice attacked Israel with massive 
ballistic missile salvos.
  Mr. Speaker, this marks the last time I will have the opportunity to 
speak in favor of this critical legislation. It has been my honor to 
represent Colorado's Fifth District through my nine terms in Congress.
  I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for their 
leadership, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important 
legislation.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), the chairman of the House 
Equality Caucus.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of reasons to support pay 
increases for military personnel but oppose the bloated $895 billion 
defense budget. My hope is that the DOGE commission will seriously 
scrutinize the Pentagon budget, which has failed seven audits in a row 
if it is to be taken seriously.
  Today, I speak out to oppose the NDAA due to the GOP leadership's 
insistence on inserting rightwing extremist dogma over national 
defense.

                              {time}  1530

  Taking away healthcare for trans kids and not expanding access to 
fertility treatments like IVF for wanting families are two examples.
  Big Brother/Big Government attacks like those just don't belong in 
this bill. If we ignore extremism now, then the next time there will be 
another group attacked, and then another and another until eventually 
no one will be left to defend you when you need it, Mr. Speaker. 
Bullies and extremists rarely stop unless stood up to.
  Stand up for military families' ability to make their own healthcare 
decisions, not what extremist MAGA Big Government wants. Mr. Speaker, 
the fight of others today might be your fight tomorrow.
  Vote ``no'' on extremism.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), who is the chairman of the 
Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.

[[Page H7094]]

  

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership, 
and I thank him for yielding, and I thank the ranking member, too, for 
the incredible work that they have done in a bipartisan way.
  As this year ends, we face a tired and turbulent world in dire need 
of leadership, vision, and strength. However, Americans should 
celebrate that there is good reason to be hopeful about the future.
  Russian forces are debilitated, and an elimination of the Syrian 
dictatorship dealt a blow to Iranian influence in the Middle East, a 
crucial win for our ally Israel.
  Nevertheless, make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, our national security 
pacing threat remains China and their drive to challenge the world 
order, a world order that is the bedrock of our economic prosperity and 
has not in any way, shape, or form waned.
  We can't afford to project weakness. We must not tolerate China's 
rising aggression. This bill refocuses our national security priorities 
while taking care of our servicemembers.
  For example, the NDAA expands the Pacific deterrence initiative and 
expands prohibitions on Department of Defense contracting with Chinese 
civil-military companies. It retains needed aircraft needed to deter 
potential Chinese conflict. It also accelerates urgent reform in the 
Joint Strike Fighter program to drive efficiencies, and it provides a 
generational 14.5 percent pay increase for our military's junior 
enlisted.
  I am pleased with these outcomes. They are imperative to maintaining 
an operationally effective and strategically relevant force.
  I also thank Ranking Member  Don Norcross, who has been an incredible 
leader. We have worked in a bipartisan way. He is a great teammate in 
these efforts and equally values our goals to deter future conflict.
  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I believe in the old Roman adage: Pray 
for peace, and prepare for war.
  It is as relevant today as it was almost 2,000 years ago. I intend 
therefore to support the National Defense Authorization Act, and I 
believe its passage is essential to our national security.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers for his leadership in delivering 
this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs), who is the ranking member of 
the House Equality Caucus and a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee.
  Ms. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to represent San Diego, the 
largest military community in the country that is home to over 118,000 
servicemembers and their families. I know firsthand the recent 
challenges to recruit and retain servicemembers in every military 
branch.
  In my community, there are so many ships that are understaffed 
because there just aren't enough servicemembers. Too many people aren't 
joining or aren't staying in the military or even recommending it as a 
career path to their relatives because they can't afford childcare, 
safe housing, or to put food on the table.
  I am so proud of everything we were able to get into this bill to 
address these challenges, but we shouldn't do anything that undermines 
our military recruitment, retention, and readiness. Restricting 
healthcare access, whether it is removing my bipartisan and bicameral 
provision for IVF coverage or a gender affirming care ban for 
dependents does exactly that.
  Our priorities should be supporting our servicemembers and military 
families who sacrifice so much for us, not making their lives any 
harder.
  That is why, sadly, I will have to vote against this year's NDAA, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Gimenez).
  Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5009. This NDAA 
ensures that the United States military remains the strongest in the 
world.
  Weak policies from this administration have invited America's enemies 
to our doorstep. Communist China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are 
actively undermining our Nation around the world and are working with 
the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua to gain a foothold in our 
hemisphere.
  This package allows us to meet the challenges ahead. I am pleased 
that the NDAA includes funding for new innovative technologies to 
better deter Putin and the CCP.
  We will strengthen our efforts domestically to protect our border by 
building a new state-of-the-art joint agency task force south in Key 
West, which happens to be in my district.
  I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this NDAA so we 
can continue to deter our enemies, safeguard our Nation, and provide 
for our servicemen and -women.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. Strong), who is my friend and colleague from the 
Alabama delegation and also a great member of the Armed Services 
Committee.
  Mr. STRONG. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act and to thank Chairman   Mike Rogers for his 
leadership.
  The district I represent is home to ``Rocket City'' USA, Redstone 
Arsenal, hundreds of servicemembers, thousands of civilians, 
contractors, military retirees, and their families.
  This year's NDAA supports the warfighter, counters aggression imposed 
by the CCP, Russia, and Iran, and authorizes a much-needed pay raise 
for our men and women in uniform, with a special focus on our junior 
enlisted servicemembers.
  In the face of global instability and unprecedented threats, this 
year's NDAA furthers military readiness and increases lethality.
  The U.S. has got to get our clip full, for everything from small arms 
to long-range missiles. To do this, we must provide stability and 
predictability to our organic and defense industrial base.
  Mr. Speaker, America is ready to roll, and I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Jackson), who is another outstanding Armed Services 
Committee member.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the NDAA is one of the most 
important pieces of legislation we consider each year, and I am proud 
to support it this year.
  First, I thank Chairman Rogers for his outstanding leadership in 
crafting such a strong defense bill.
  This NDAA will modernize our military, improve the lives of 
servicemembers, and address the threats faced by our Nation.
  This legislation will authorize major construction projects at the 
Pantex Plant, provide a pathway for Sheppard Air Force Base to be 
designated as a technical training center of excellence, and ensure key 
programs like the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft remain on track.
  The NDAA also reestablishes the medical officer of the Marine Corps 
to ensure proper medical care is provided for our United States 
Marines.
  Finally, the bill halts the dangerous proposed cuts to the Special 
Operations Forces of our country.
  I thank, again, Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for their 
leadership in putting together such an impactful bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote 
``yes'' on the NDAA.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Khanna), who is the ranking member of the HASC 
Subcommittee on Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation.
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for his 
leadership. Also I want to thank Chair Rogers who has conducted the 
committee with bipartisanship. I got to travel with him, and he is fun 
to travel with.
  My opposition here is not with disrespect to either the chairman or 
the ranking member.
  As people know, I have been concerned about the Pentagon budget 
getting almost to $1 trillion, and I am concerned about the five primes 
and the

[[Page H7095]]

amount of cost overruns they have had; when you look at the F-35s and 
Lockheed, a contract that has been delayed, that has almost $200 
billion in cost overruns; when you look at the IG report about Boeing 
getting $150,000 for soap dispensers; when you look at the reports 
about electric breast pumps being charged to our military for $1,400 
when in other places you can get it for $200.
  There is a lot of waste in this budget, and my hope is, actually, 
with the committee that we will engage with Elon Musk and engage with 
DOGE on this issue to have a Pentagon budget that is going to be more 
modernized, where the American people will get their value of their tax 
dollars, where we can have more competition for the five primes and 
have a strong national security with a lower budget.
  I hope we can do that in a bipartisan way. My hope is that Musk, what 
he did with SpaceX in disrupting Lockheed and Boeing, with the ULA 
maybe finds areas that we can disrupt other five primes. I will oppose 
and vote ``no'' on this budget with the hope that next year we can find 
cost savings.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), who is one of the senior 
members of the Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to 
support the National Defense Authorization Act. I appreciate so much 
the leadership of Chairman   Mike Rogers and Ranking Member Adam Smith 
for their diligent work for providing this crucial National Defense 
Authorization Act for peace through strength.
  This is a bipartisan legislation including critical provisions for 
the Palmetto State, including its military bases and critical missions 
at the Savannah River site.
  As a 31-year veteran of the Army National Guard, myself along with 
three sons who have served in Iraq, Egypt, and Afghanistan, I 
especially appreciate this legislation which supports the deployment of 
the National Guard to the southern border, cuts inefficient programs 
and bureaucracy, and guts programs at the Department of Defense.
  It reaffirms congressional support for our allies and partners in the 
Indo-Pacific by countering Chinese Communist Party influence, by fully 
funding military information operations assistance to the region.
  It also ensures Israel has adequate stocks of air defense 
interceptors to defend itself against the regime in Tehran. War 
criminal Putin and dictators like Assad must be deterred from 
invasions.
  Additionally, the NDAA fully supports and requires plutonium pit 
production at the Savannah River Site and Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. It is clear that the National Nuclear Security 
Administration must do everything possible to restore this vital 
capability as quickly as possible and without delay for peace through 
strength.

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the NDAA.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to address a little bit the concerns about the 
size of the Pentagon budget and the efficiency and effectiveness.
  First of all, it is important to point out that the defense budget as 
a percentage of GDP is the lowest that it has been since after World 
War II. As our budget has grown and ballooned collectively, that has 
primarily been because of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and 
a variety of other programs, all of which I enthusiastically support, 
but as a percentage of GDP we are actually spending less on defense now 
than we have, as I said, at any point since World War II.
  The notion that the defense budget is ballooning out of control 
doesn't take into account inflation and growth. We are at a more 
reasonable place than some portray, first of all.
  Second of all, we keep hearing, oh, they failed another audit.
  What is actually happening is we are getting better on that point. We 
were not going to fix the audit problems that the Pentagon had 6, 7 
years ago in a year or 2 or even 5. Nevertheless, just to give you a 
couple of ideas, Mr. Speaker, multiple agencies within the Pentagon are 
now passing their audits whereas they didn't before, including the 
United States Marine Corps.
  In another decent measure of this, the Department of the Navy broadly 
has not passed its audit, but 5 or 6 years ago they were only 5 percent 
clean, and now they are 80 percent clean.
  I don't want to leave the public with the mistaken impression that we 
are ignoring this problem or not making any progress on it. We are. A 
big part of the reason we are making progress on it is because of the 
leadership on the House Armed Services Committee.
  Under Mr. Rogers and previously under me and before that under Mac 
Thornberry, this has been a priority for us in the House and the Senate 
for some time. We are making progress. We are not ignoring the problem. 
It is not a pass-fail. It is a matter of improvement. We are optimistic 
that in another 2 or 3 years we will get to that happy day when the 
entire Pentagon budget can pass that audit, but we had a big hole to 
dig out of. We are making progress on digging out of said hole, and I 
want to make sure people are aware of that.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. McClain).
  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, the world is on fire, and now, more than ever, we must 
ensure we have the premier fighting force in the world. With our 
enemies encroaching, we cannot afford unnecessary diversions.
  This bill builds on House Republicans' progress to return our 
military to lethal fighting force and away from woke ideologies that 
seek to divide and distract.
  To confront the 21st century battlefield, we must invest in 
operations and technologies that deter our enemies and support our 
regional allies.
  Some of these state-of-the-art technologies are developed in 
Michigan's Ninth District.
  I was proud to ensure initiatives in this year's bill to bolster our 
national security and our workforce.
  The defense of our Nation and safety of all Americans should always 
be our highest priority.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this year's NDAA so that 
we deliver mission-critical results.

                              {time}  1545

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda), a member of the House Armed 
Services Committee.
  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, the last-minute effort to deny critical 
healthcare to military children diagnosed with gender dysphoria is a 
shameful attack on military families who deserve better from their 
elected Representatives.
  Our military families deserve our support for the sacrifices they 
make, not our intervention into their deeply personal healthcare 
decisions, and certainly not those involving their children.
  For transgender people, gender-affirming care is healthcare. To deny 
them this care is to deny that they exist. The reality is that they do 
exist, and there are thousands of military families with transgender 
children. There are 15,000 transgender individuals who wear the 
uniform. They deserve, like any child in our country, to be their true, 
authentic selves and to receive the care that helps them to live 
freely.
  As a mother, I cannot idly stand by and vote to deny healthcare to 
children who need it, nor can I stand by while my colleagues use 
transgender people to score cheap political points.
  To pass a bill dedicated to the quality of life of military families 
while stripping away healthcare from their children is not just ironic, 
but it is twisted, cruel, and plain wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against the 
NDAA so that we can remove this discriminatory provision and truly, 
truly stand with our military families.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time 
is remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama has 11 minutes 
remaining.

[[Page H7096]]

  

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Guam (Mr. Moylan).
  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the people 
of Guam by voting ``yes'' on the 2025 NDAA.
  Guam is in the USINDOPACOM area. This bill authorizes $4 billion for 
economic activity on Guam, $2 billion planned for 2025. This is a 
historic investment for Guam. It supports our infrastructure, defends 
our community, and protects our Nation.
  There is $600 million for Guam missile defense, protecting my 
constituents from direct PRC and North Korean threats.
  Additionally, it includes $100 million for Marine Corps Drive, our 
public roadway on Guam, for upgrades to provide easier access for our 
civilians and our military.
  Also, it recognizes Guam's history, which directs the DOD to provide 
a report regarding the use of Agent Orange on Guam. It would clarify 
how Agent Orange was used on the island, and it would start the 
groundwork for corrective action that is desperately needed.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support of Guam, and I 
encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this year's 2025 NDAA.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close at this 
time, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr.  Mike Garcia).
  Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rogers for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, this will be my last floor speech as a Member of the 
U.S. House of Representatives, and I am beyond proud that the last few 
minutes of my time on this floor is dedicated to our troops.
  I rise today in support of the NDAA, but I rise, above all things, in 
support of our servicemembers and their families.
  During my 4\1/2\ years as a Member of Congress, my office has 
championed this effort to get our troops off of food stamps and above 
the poverty line.
  At times, it felt very difficult, but we have ultimately followed 
through with this commitment and this promise to our folks in uniform, 
especially our junior enlisted personnel who, just a couple of years 
ago, were making only $22,000 a year as a base salary.
  My historic Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act was signed into law 
in February 2023 and allows our Active-Duty troops' spouses to cross-
deck their professional licenses across all 50 States when they move, 
without having to spend thousands of dollars and potentially years 
getting recertified.
  It was a huge victory for our servicemembers and their families, but 
it didn't solve the pay problems that our personnel were having.
  This week, we will pass this year's NDAA, which includes our historic 
14.5 percent pay raise for our junior enlisted, and this, in 
combination with the Defense appropriations bills over the last 2 
years, represents the single largest pay raise for our enlisted troops 
in our Nation's history.
  I thank Chairman Rogers and Chairman Calvert from the Appropriations 
Committee for truly driving this and enabling this.
  Lastly, I thank God for this imperfect Union that we call America. 
She is only held together by the stitches sewn by the men and women and 
their families who serve in our military every day and in the future, 
and held together by the veterans who served in the past. May we never 
forget their sacrifices, for they are the ones who have delivered us 
this great gift called the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of Congress to support our military 
and this NDAA.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, go Navy, beat Army.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans), a fine member of the Armed 
Services Committee.
  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my 
support for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2025.
  Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for our 
country, and they should be compensated accordingly.
  As a former Navy helicopter pilot, a Navy spouse, and now a Navy mom, 
I am laser focused on addressing obstacles faced by our servicemembers. 
I was proud to serve on the House Armed Services Committee Quality of 
Life Panel, where we addressed issues for our servicemembers, including 
increases to military pay, housing, healthcare, childcare, and spousal 
support.
  Pay is one of the many quality of life improvements needed across the 
board for our servicemembers. That is why I fought hard to include a 
pay raise for our junior enlisted servicemembers in the final text. The 
14.5 percent pay increase for E-1 through E-4s will ensure military 
salaries can remain competitive with the private sector.
  At a time when our world grows more dangerous every day, America 
needs to prioritize our warfighters and ensure that we can maintain a 
ready, capable, and lethal fighting force. It is imperative that our 
military men and women earn a salary befitting of the service they 
provide to our country.
  Today's legislation is exactly what we need to deter our adversaries, 
improve the quality of life for our servicemembers, and revitalize our 
defense industrial base. I am confident that passing the NDAA will be a 
significant win for the young men and women in the military and their 
families, our national security, and our entire country.
  I am always proud to advocate in Congress for our servicemembers and 
their quality of life.
  Mr. Speaker, I will close by saying, as my colleague did: Go Navy, 
and beat Army.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Iowa (Mr. Nunn).
  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his hard work 
on this year's National Defense Authorization Act.
  To my Navy allies who have just spoken prior, I am glad to have a 
little air support in the room here as a combat veteran with the U.S. 
Air Force.
  I thank all of our men and women currently serving in uniform. Their 
hard work is not only the reason that we do this, but it is the best 
defense we have for our Nation.
  I am grateful that this bill contains our effort to lead with real 
technology advancements in the National Defense Authorization Act, 
including our greatest ally, Israel, which is why I am proud that our 
portion of the NDAA was included.
  This effort will break through traditional procurement barriers to 
allow partnership that will focus on both efficiency in weaponry, 
technology, and innovation, as well as lethality to be able to defend 
our country, both on the field as well as modernizing the future of 
warfare and national defense.
  Mr. Speaker, I am most emphatic that the leadership of this bill 
truly recognizes our junior enlisted force, one of the most 
professional in the world. As a commander, it is a privilege to be able 
to sign on to the largest pay increase for our junior troops ever, at 
nearly 15 percent.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill and thank the chairman for 
his leadership.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. Nunn) for his words, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 to fund our military and take 
care of our troops.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to represent our Nation's greatest 
warfighters at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point 
and New River.
  This legislation robustly funds and modernizes our Armed Forces to 
prepare us for threats abroad, improves the quality of life for our 
servicemembers and their families, and refocuses the Pentagon's mission 
on national security and away from political distractions.

[[Page H7097]]

  The package will strengthen our military and its lethality, deliver 
pay raises for our troops, reduce healthcare wait times, improve access 
to childcare, and support employment for military spouses.
  Further, it will eliminate woke programs, gut political bureaucracy, 
and support the deployment of National Guard troops to assist our 
Border Patrol.
  North Carolina's Third District will greatly benefit from the $208 
million in funding secured for military construction projects on our 
bases and $50 million in impact aid that will help our military 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this year's National Defense Authorization Act 
and urge my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't really have anything more to add than what I 
said in the opening statement, so I won't belabor the point. It is, in 
so many ways, a very good bill that was worked through the process.
  I regret that we have injected, again, that partisan wedge issue into 
it. It is a controversial topic, trying to figure out what medical 
treatment transgender youth or youth experiencing gender dysphoria 
should get, but I worry in some instances that there is a denial of the 
existence of the condition. It is an absolute fact that some minors 
experience gender dysphoria.
  Mr. Speaker, I guess the one thing I didn't say in my opening 
statement that is worth adding is, on TRICARE, there are about 1.8 
million dependents. The estimates that I have gotten--and they are a 
little fuzzy because they won't give specifics for, I think, some 
obvious reasons--are that roughly 4,000 children are being treated out 
of that 1.8 million, and not all 4,000 of those children being treated 
are receiving the treatments that are being prohibited in this bill.

  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a small number of young people, but 
we are restricting access to their healthcare based on our opinion, not 
based on the opinion of the U.S. medical community. That, I think, is a 
mistake.
  Again, I close on a positive note. I thank Chairman Rogers, HASC, the 
Armed Services Committee, and all the staff. I didn't thank the Senate 
in my opening remarks either. I suppose we have to.
  All kidding aside, the Senate was good to work with on this process, 
and I think, ultimately, HASC and SASC have met their requirements and 
did what we have done for 63 consecutive years in working together on a 
bipartisan, bicameral bill, with the overwhelming bulk of the focus on 
what is best for the servicemen and -women who defend our country that 
we are so proud of.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member because, as is obvious to 
anybody listening, he is very bright and very articulate, but he is 
also just a great friend and tremendous partner in working together in 
a bipartisan fashion year in and year out as we work on these important 
issues. I appreciate his help so much in fashioning this bill.
  I will begrudgingly go ahead and acknowledge that our Senate 
counterparts have been pretty great to work with, too. Senator Reed and 
Senator Wicker are great gentlemen and have been real partners as we 
have gotten this bill to this point.
  I thank the Armed Services Committee staff, as well as the leadership 
staff, the Rules Committee, the CBO, legislative counsel, the 
Parliamentarian's Office, and the Clerk's Office for all of their hard 
work in helping us get to where we are. I also thank Speaker Johnson 
for his leadership in moving this bill forward.
  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us represents a bicameral compromise. 
Each corner has some wins and some losses, but the totality of the bill 
deserves support from all Members.
  This bill would help revitalize our defense industrial base. It will 
build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter 
China and our other adversaries, and it will provide historic 
improvements in the quality of life of our servicemembers and their 
families.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (NDAA).
  It is with regret that I must oppose this legislation that sets 
policy for the Department of Defense. I do want to acknowledge the work 
that Ranking Member Smith and the Armed Services conferees did to 
remove many of the worst social policy riders contained in the version 
of this legislation that passed the House earlier this year, however, I 
have three problems that leave me unable to support the legislation 
today.
  First, I want to address concerns I have long had with how the 
authorizers on the Armed Services Committee use the NDAA to constrain 
the Appropriations Committee in our work to responsibly fund the 
Department of Defense. In the House, I serve as the Ranking Member of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, which has the 
responsibility to allocate annual funding for the Department of 
Defense. As appropriators, we have a statutory defense budget cap under 
the Fiscal Responsibility Act that we must meet. Absent an action by 
Congress, we cannot appropriate beyond what the law allows. 
Unfortunately, while this NDAA conforms to the level of Fiscal 
Responsibility Act, it sets defense spending expectations that in the 
short-term will complicate appropriators while we work to complete the 
Fiscal Year 2025 Defense Appropriations Act. In the long-term it does 
nothing to control the unsustainable trajectory of defense spending 
that must at some point be confronted.
  Let me provide an example of this clash of unsustainable spending 
priorities within our national security budget. That is the challenge 
of balancing support for our military personnel and their families with 
resourcing the rest of the defense budget. To be very clear, I have 
always supported pay raises for our troops. I worked with the 
Department of Defense to appropriately fund them when I was Chair of 
the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in the 117th Congress. I also 
improved funding for the Basic Allowance for Housing, Basic Allowance 
for Subsistence, childcare services, and safer barracks. But this NDAA 
includes a 4.5 percent pay raise for all service members, and an 
additional pay raise beyond that for junior enlisted service members 
that totals 14.5 percent. Appropriations will need to find the 
resources this fiscal year and in future fiscal years, to cover this 
cost. I also have concerns with how this could impact the balance of 
the entire military pay scale.
  But we know that the quality-of-life concerns for military families 
go well beyond pay. Critically important things like affordable 
housing, quality healthcare, and childcare access must be addressed. 
And we know that the dramatically rising costs of resourcing our 
military personnel must be balanced against our other national security 
priorities. Among those include supporting the development of 
innovative defense technologies, fixing a fundamentally broken 
shipbuilding industry, modernizing major weapons programs, and ensuring 
our troops have the best training and equipment possible so that they 
can complete their missions and come home safely. We also live in a 
world of significant geopolitical conflict. That requires additional 
resources to fund U.S. operations overseas that were not planned for 
during the development of the Pentagon's annual budget.
  This NDAA includes language requiring the Department and the Services 
to implement plans to get programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, 
the Sentinel Program, or our fundamentally broken shipbuilding process 
under control. Based on my own experience with these programs, I 
question whether these efforts in the NDAA will be successful. But I do 
know that Congress cannot afford to wait any longer to fix a broken 
Pentagon acquisition process that produces delays and cost overruns in 
these and other programs.
  Unfortunately, the costs of accepting this process are now running 
headfirst into the rising costs of increased military personnel pay and 
supporting quality-of-life improvement programs for military families. 
None of this is sustainable in the long-term, and it will fall to the 
appropriators to balance the dollars. At some point, Congress must 
stand up and make quicker and tougher decisions when it comes to 
festering procurement problems in the Department of Defense. We must 
fix our broken defense acquisition process and stop boxing the 
Appropriations Committee into corners.
  Second, I am disappointed that this legislation includes a provision 
allowing the Air Force to transfer certain Air National Guard personnel 
with space missions to the Space Force absent consultation with the 
Governors. The precedent this will set in upending the Governor's 
authority over their National Guards is deeply concerning to me, and I 
made that clear in hearings the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee had 
with the Reserve Component and the Department of the

[[Page H7098]]

Air Force. That is also why nearly every Governor in the United States 
opposes this proposal. As a former member of the Minnesota House of 
Representatives, I worked at the state level with the Minnesota 
National Guard to provide them with the necessary state resources to do 
their jobs. So, it is unfortunate to see that the Air Force failed to 
follow a collaborative process with the Governors in advancing their 
legislative proposal in Congress. If they had, I think we could have 
found an outcome that satisfied all parties. I believe by accepting the 
more expansive Senate version of this language, that the Armed Services 
Committee has made a serious error they will regret.
  Finally, I am deeply opposed to Speaker Johnson's eleventh-hour 
insertion of a controversial provision that was not included in the 
House version of the bill which would prohibit TRICARE from providing 
gender affirming health care to children in military families. This 
language is discriminatory. It is a signal to military families with 
transgender children that their service is not valued. Make no mistake, 
it will force service members to choose between continuing their own 
military service or providing their families with the health care they 
need and deserve. The language is also overly broad, and it is not 
clear what the text of the bill defines as ``medical interventions for 
the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization.'' 
No one knows exactly what this means. But it will prevent the teenager 
of a service member, who is facing great health care challenges, from 
getting the physical and mental health support that they need. The 
decisions on how the TRICARE regulations will be written will be made 
by bureaucrats in Washington, not families and their doctors. 
Republicans in Congress should get their heads out of the personal 
lives of our military families and worry more about providing our 
service members with the support they need to perform their missions 
effectively and come home safely.
  Mr. Speaker, again I am disappointed that I cannot support the 
legislation today. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill so we 
can get a more bipartisan compromise NDAA.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today as a 
proud American who supports all who are willing to put their lives on 
the line to protect liberty and justice for all. This is why:
  I introduced H.R. 39 the ``original Honoring our WWII Merchant 
Mariners Act of 2023'' to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish the Merchant Mariner 
Equity Compensation Fund to provide benefits to certain individuals who 
served in the United States merchant marine (including the Army 
Transport Service and the Naval Transport Service) during World War II.
  I introduced H.R. 5979 the ``VA Home Loan Awareness Act of 2023'' to 
require each enterprise to include on the Uniform Residential Loan 
Application a disclaimer to increase awareness of the direct and 
guaranteed home loan programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
and for other purposes.
  I introduced H.R. 165 the ``Improving Access to Homes for Heroes Act 
of 2021'' to require the inclusion of veterans in housing planning and 
an annual report on housing assistance to veterans, and for other 
purposes.
  I introduced H.R. 9055 the Justice for Milton Holland Legislation to 
provide for the posthumous commission as a captain in the regular Army 
of Milton Holland, who, while sergeant major of the 5th Regiment, 
United States Colored Infantry, was awarded the Medal of Honor for 
gallantry during the Civil War.
  Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, despite my attempts to submit them as 
amendments, not one of these bills was included in this National 
Defense Authorization Act.
  Sadly Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, and more, I have decided to 
withhold my support for this version of the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I trust that future Congresses will work more 
diligently to pass a more just, and inclusive, National Defense 
Authorization Act.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moran). All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1612, the previous question is ordered.
  The question is on the motion by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
Rogers).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.

   CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE GLOBAL 
ILLICIT DRUG TRADE--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. 
                           DOC. NO. 118-184)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to global illicit drug 
trafficking declared in Executive Order 14059 of December 15, 2021, is 
to continue in effect beyond December 15, 2024.
  The trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including 
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the deaths of tens of 
thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal 
overdoses with their own tragic human toll. Drug cartels, transnational 
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources 
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid 
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. 
International drug trafficking--including the illicit production, 
global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs; the rise of 
extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids; as 
well as the growing role of Internet-based drug sales--continues to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 14059 with respect to global illicit drug 
trafficking.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, December 11, 2024.

 CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SERIOUS HUMAN 
 RIGHTS ABUSE AND CORRUPTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
                      STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-183)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 
of December 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond December 20 , 
2024.
  The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption that 
have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United 
States, continue to threaten the stability of international political 
and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the 
values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and 
functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken 
democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent 
conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; undermine 
economic markets; and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to 
serious human rights abuse and corruption.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

                     HONORING THE LIFE OF BOB HOLT

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H7101]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of renowned 
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette sports reporter Bob Holt, who passed away 
December 4 after collapsing following the Arkansas football game 
against the Missouri Tigers, his alma mater.
  Since 1981, Bob covered the Razorbacks and sports across Arkansas, 
bringing every game to life in a unique way that only Bob Holt could.
  He was a titan of the media industry, revered for his ability to get 
an answer to any question, all while maintaining the utmost respect 
from coaches, players, and his fellow reporters.
  Bob leaves a resounding legacy in his wake, and his mark in the 
Arkansas sports community will go down in history. Not only was Bob an 
unparalleled reporter, he was a faithful and loyal friend.
  Matt Jones, a friend and colleague of Bob's for many years, said that 
if the world was full of Bob Holts, it would be a lot better world, a 
lot kinder world, a lot more peaceful world. It would be a world that 
laughs a lot more, and it would be a much, much better place.
  My prayers go out to his family, friends, and all Arkansans mourning 
our loss.

         SUPPORTING BARTON HEALTH SCIENCES BUILDING INITIATIVE

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Barton 
College's initiative to construct a new health sciences building on 
their Wilson campus.
  The initial funding phase is estimated at $19 million, and it will be 
a wonderful investment.
  It is essential to ensure a more robust talent pipeline for North 
Carolina's healthcare industry. Given the health disparities across 
eastern North Carolina, Barton College aims to ensure a brighter future 
for our State's healthcare system and the residents who rely on it 
daily for their mental and physical well-being.
  A new health sciences building will provide additional labs, research 
space, and improved technology for students which will yield huge 
dividends for Wilson County and eastern North Carolina.

             CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA FOOTBALL

  (Mr. CLYDE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2024 SEC 
champions, my MBA alma mater, the University of Georgia Bulldogs.
  During a thrilling overtime game last Saturday, the Dawgs defeated 
the University of Texas Longhorns 22-19. This exciting win marks the 
15th time the University of Georgia will bring home the SEC 
championship trophy to Athens.
  Congratulations to all the talented young men who put their 
everything into the game but especially to the Ninth District's own 
quarterback, Gunner Stockton, from Rabun County, who came off the bench 
to help lead the Georgia Bulldogs to victory.
  I also want to recognize the other incredibly talented Dawgs from 
Georgia's Ninth District who helped clinch another SEC title. Well done 
to Buford's K.J. Bolden, Jake Pope, and Marek Briley, as well as to 
Gainesville's own Dan Jackson.
  Congratulations to the entire University of Georgia football team and 
coaching staff led by the legendary Coach Kirby Smart.
  Go Dawgs. Let's bring home another national championship.

              SUPPORTING SERVICEMEMBERS AT HOME AND ABROAD

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today the House passed the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025.
  I voted for the legislation, as this body upholds again the over 60-
year bipartisan tradition, ensuring partisan politics does not put 
America's national security at risk.
  As a senior Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I 
greatly appreciate the bipartisan work of the defense authorizing 
committee. Their collaboration has resulted in a bill that supports our 
patriotic servicemembers at home and abroad, and the legislation meets 
that call through its 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted 
servicemembers and a 4.5 percent increase for all other members of our 
military.
  Our State of Ohio is home to over 31,000 servicemembers including 
those on Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard duty. They have 
earned this much-needed increase in pay at a time when too many of our 
citizens are struggling to afford basic needs.
  This legislation also authorizes $121 million for defense-related 
upgrades in Ohio to further strengthen avenues of collaboration between 
the Department of Defense and Ohio's installations.
  Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and Kwanzaa to our dear 
servicemembers who are serving liberty at home and abroad.

                 HONORING AVON MARCHING BLACK AND GOLD

  (Mr. BAIRD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Avon Marching Black and 
Gold, Avon High School's marching band who won both the 2024 Bands of 
America Grand National Championship and the ISSMA State finals for the 
second year in a row.
  Avon High School's marching band also won all three special award 
categories at the 2024 Bands of America Championship, taking home 
awards for Outstanding Music Performance, Outstanding Visual 
Performance, and Outstanding General Effect Performance.
  I congratulate the students on their two big wins this year, and I am 
proud of their outstanding talent and perseverance that has led to 
their continued successes and national dominance.
  I also thank the parents, teachers, directors, and volunteers for 
their hard work and dedication to this program. They couldn't have done 
it without you.
  Congratulations again to the Avon Marching Black and Gold.

         RECOGNIZING THE KILOHANA TEMPORARY GROUP HOUSING SITE

  (Ms. TOKUDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, for millions of our fellow Americans, 
Thanksgiving is about returning home, a time to gather with loved ones 
in a place both familiar and safe.
  On my way back to Hawaii for the Thanksgiving recess, with long 
delays and packed airports and planes, it hit me for too many of our 
Maui ``family,'' ``ohana,'' this is but a sliver of what they have been 
trying to do for the past 16 months. They are just trying to go home.
  A week before Thanksgiving, I joined the Folaumoeloa ``family,'' 
``ohana'' as they became the first family to move into the new Kilohana 
Temporary Group Housing Site in Lahaina. By this spring, 167 modular 
units will house survivors and their families.
  While these housing units can never replace what was lost, we hope 
they will soon be made homes by the people, the love, and the hopes and 
dreams that will fill the space between these walls.
  A big ``thank you,'' ``mahalo'' to FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, 
the State of Hawaii, Maui County, and all our contractors and community 
partners for their hard work and dedication.
  Thanks to them, families like the Folaumoeloas are moving in months 
ahead of schedule to a place where they can look ahead to the future 
and to what this community will one day be.

       CONGRATULATING DELEGATE ERIC HOUSEHOLDER ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. MOONEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

[[Page H7102]]

minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend 
Delegate Eric Householder as he retires from the West Virginia House of 
Delegates after 14 years of service.
  For the last 2 years, he has served as the house majority leader and 
previously chaired the house finance committee. As a small business 
owner, Eric ran for elected office to fight back against the job-
crushing regulations coming out of Charleston and to reform our tax 
code.
  With the help of Eric's leadership, West Virginians have less 
regulation, lower taxes, and educational freedom. I am proud to bestow 
upon Delegate Householder my Congressional Patriot Award for 
excellence, leadership, volunteerism, and selflessness, virtues without 
which our Republic cannot thrive.
  While his time in the house of delegates has come to an end, I know 
that Delegate Householder is not done serving our State.
  I thank Delegate Householder for his years of service and his 
tireless efforts to improve the lives of West Virginians. I wish him 
all the best in his future endeavors.

            RECOGNIZING CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
first ever Energy and Commerce Committee chairwoman and my friend, 
Cathy McMorris Rodgers, for her excellent work in leading the most 
bipartisan committee in Congress.
  Under her leadership, the committee has worked effectively, 
efficiently, and in a bipartisan manner to advance legislation that 
will improve the life of all Americans.
  Chair Rodgers introduced bipartisan legislation that would provide 
necessary resources for Down syndrome research. She has also led us in 
combating the Biden administration's damaging overregulation and war on 
American energy.
  I was proud to work with her on the ADVANCE Act to enhance our civil 
nuclear leadership, which is now law. She also held insightful hearings 
on TikTok and the threat that it poses to our youth and national 
security.
  Her time as the chair enhanced the United States and its citizens, 
and we will surely miss her.
  We surely wish her well in her retirement.
  I thank Cathy for all her work.

                      A BIPARTISAN WIN FOR HOUSTON

  (Mr. HUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HUNT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate yet another 
bipartisan win for the city of Houston this week. Within the WRDA bill 
the House passed yesterday, there were several important priorities 
that Congresswoman Fletcher and I spearheaded to ensure another 
catastrophic flooding event, like Hurricane Harvey, never happens 
again.
  Specifically, the Army Corps of Engineers is now statutorily required 
to finish one of the most important studies facing Texas, the ``Buffalo 
Bayou and Tributaries Resiliency Study.''
  Without the completion of this study, construction of a tunnel 
underneath our city will never be built to route floodwater away from 
my friends and neighbors in TX-38 and TX-7 and into the Gulf of Mexico.
  I personally thank Congresswoman Fletcher and the brilliant staff in 
the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment for all of their 
hard work to ensure Houstonians can remain resilient in the face of 
another disaster.

  PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM HARMFUL AND IRREVERSIBLE MEDICAL PROCEDURES

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act 
takes an important step to protect children from harmful and 
irreversible medical procedures.
  It includes a provision to permanently ban the Department of Defense 
from providing minors with medical treatments for gender dysphoria, 
such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers that can result in 
sterilization.
  Children should have the chance to grow up without being subjected to 
experimental procedures that can cause permanent damage to their bodies 
and futures. These are minors we are talking about here. What business 
is it of the Department of Defense to be engaging in this?
  These treatments are life-altering, and their long-term effects are 
still unknown. The Federal Government has no business funding or 
endorsing such practices, particularly when they involve children.
  This provision ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to promote 
controversial and harmful treatments for minors.
  Including this ban in the NDAA reflects a commitment to common sense 
and the protection of our Nation's youth and focuses the Defense 
Department on defending the homeland. It is a step in the right 
direction for safeguarding the futures of these children.

                 HONORING HOUSTON'S MILLENNIAL LEADERS

  (Mrs. LEE CARTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize some of the 
637,000 millennials who make up 28 percent of Houston's population. 
These remarkable individuals are reshaping our city through their 
innovation, leadership, and commitment to excellence.
  I recognize Danielle Keys Bess, a dynamic force in real estate and 
public service. She has elevated our community through her work with 
campaigns, organizations like Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, 
and the Houston Black Real Estate Association.
  In construction, Julian Paul Johnson, Jr., vice president at Skilled 
Construction, exemplifies progress with his dedication to process 
improvement and his recognition as a 2019 Urban Land Institute Young 
Leader.
  We also have individuals like Jose Torre, a construction 
entrepreneur, and Emily Anassi, an immigrant excelling at logistics. 
They remind us of the diverse talents driving our city and our Nation 
forward.
  I would like to celebrate legal powerhouse Bianca Calderon de 
Lachica, whose advocacy dominates Houston's highways, and Alva Kattan, 
an entrepreneur redefining success.
  Finally, I recognize Uzair Hasan, owner of Millennial Magazine, who 
highlights Houston's creativity and our future.
  Together, these individuals demonstrate that America's largest 
generation is ready to take up the mantle.
  As an Xennial, I recognize their achievements and encourage their 
future success to make our community a better place to live, work, and 
play.

   CELEBRATING THE LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

  (Mr. PALMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the leadership of 
my dear friend, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
  Serving alongside Cathy has been an honor. She is not only a fierce 
advocate for her constituents but a principled leader with a servant 
heart.
  As the first chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy 
has shown what it means to always put the needs of the American people 
first.
  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Cathy's faith is what I 
admire most. Whether it is by sharing an encouraging comment or during 
prayer walks around the Capitol, Cathy has strived to honor the Lord 
every day.
  After I was elected to Congress, I had the opportunity to meet with 
Cathy, who at the time was chairwoman of the House Republican 
Conference. It was

[[Page H7103]]

during that meeting that Cathy made me feel like I belonged here.
  Cathy McMorris Rodgers is special. During my time serving in 
Congress, Cathy has become a great friend and a great example of what 
it means to lead with grace and faith.
  Even though we will miss her here, I am excited for what the Lord has 
in store for her. May God bless her and may He continue to guide her 
steps in this next season of life.

                          ____________________

             RECOGNIZING ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL

  (Mr. SCHWEIKERT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, for those of us from the Valley of the 
Sun, the Phoenix, Arizona, area, there is an excitement around us. Our 
college team, Arizona State University, which was predicted to be last 
in its first year in the Big 12, has made the college playoffs. As a 
matter of fact, they won the Big 12 and they get a bye in their first 
playoff game.
  For the community, the excitement, the joy, and having one of the 
youngest coaches in America, I can only be thankful to the team. Being 
predicted to be last and coming out where they are, you have provided 
hope, joy, and excitement to our community.
  I thank Arizona State University football.

            RECOGNIZING CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to recognize Congresswoman Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers, who is retiring at the end of the 118th Congress.
  In 2004, the two of us came to the House in the same class, and we 
have been friends throughout our time here.
  Cathy has the distinction of being the first woman to give birth 
three times while in the House. She is a visible and vocal leader 
within the disabilities community, and her advocacy is inspired by her 
son, Cole, who was born with Down syndrome.
  I thank the gentlewoman for her years of service to this great 
institution, to her constituents in Washington's Fifth Congressional 
District, and to the American people.
  May God continue to bless her, her husband, Brian; and Cole, Grace, 
and Brynn, their three children, as she enters a well-deserved 
retirement.

                    MAKING OUR MILITARY GREAT AGAIN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, the House passed the Servicemember 
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2025, otherwise known as the Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA.
  The Fiscal Year 2025 NDAA will improve the quality of life for every 
servicemember who serves our great country. It restores the focus of 
our military on lethality, not woke ideology. It improves the 
military's ability to recruit and train our fighting forces to be able 
to deter China and our other adversaries. It also increases oversight 
and requires accountability of the Biden administration and the 
Department of Defense.
  All of these tremendous accomplishments are why we are here tonight, 
Mr. Speaker.
  To speak in support of this recently passed bill that will make our 
military great again, I am grateful for the Members who join me this 
evening to discuss this important bill to protect our country and 
restore our national security.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Missouri (Mr. 
Alford).
  Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. Rose for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my unwavering support for the 
2025 National Defense Authorization Act.
  We must ensure our Nation's military remains the greatest force for 
freedom and stability the world has ever known, and this year's NDAA 
does just that.
  At this very moment, our Nation faces numerous threats from the 
growing aggression from China and Russia to the persistent menace of 
terrorism. It is imperative that we ensure our military is provided the 
resources and support they need to defend our interests and keep 
Americans secure.
  The fiscal year 2025 NDAA authorizes $895 billion in defense spending 
to support our military's critical missions, enabling us to modernize 
our Nation's capabilities. From upgrading our naval and air power to 
investing in cutting-edge technologies, we will remain superior against 
our adversaries.
  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District will receive major wins in 
this legislation, wins that we have fought hard for on the Armed 
Services Committee. Whiteman Air Force Base in Fort Leonard Wood will 
receive a combined total of $139.5 million for fueling facilities and 
advanced individual training barracks.
  There will be expanded access to childcare for Missouri's military 
families and to programs that help military spouses attain and retain 
employment.
  We are ecstatic to announce a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior 
enlisted servicemembers and a 4.5 percent pay raise for all other 
servicemembers.
  This legislation isn't just about numbers. It is about the values 
that we hold dear as Americans. It is about our commitment to freedom, 
to justice, and the protection of our citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, this year's NDAA embodied our unwavering commitment to 
America's military excellence, reflecting the values that have always 
made our Nation strong. We are prioritizing the well-being of our 
military families, bolstering the readiness of our Armed Forces, and 
fortifying our national security.
  To truly restore our military's lethal edge, we have to purge the 
radical, woke ideologies that are being forced on our servicemen and -
women, infiltrating our ranks.

                              {time}  1715

  These divisive concepts have plagued our military and are undermining 
our elite cohesion and combat effectiveness.
  That is why this year's NDAA will take bold action: Number one, 
banning life-altering transgender medical treatments for minors; 
prohibiting the toxic spread of critical race theory; dismantling the 
bloated DEI bureaucracy; blocking a misguided military Green New Deal; 
and countering anti-Semitism.
  By eliminating these destructive influences, we are reclaiming our 
military's focus on its core mission: defending Americans and their 
interests.
  Mr. Speaker, as you saw today, this is not a bipartisan bill. This is 
an American bill.
  We are not just funding the military, we are improving the lives of 
those who protect us every day.
  By passing the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, we have sent 
a clear message to our adversaries: America will not be intimidated. 
America will always reign as the greatest nation on Earth.


                Honoring the Life of Dr. Gene Richardson

  Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an 
extraordinary man, Dr. Gene Richardson, a mentor, a friend of mine, and 
someone who was really like a second father to me. He was a man who had 
one of the biggest impacts on my life and who is one of the reasons I 
am standing here today in this very Hall.
  Dr. Richardson was a man of remarkable character and compassion. Born 
in Kennett, down in the bootheel of Missouri, he embodied the values of 
hard work, faith, and service from a very young age.
  Growing up as the youngest of five children, Dr. Richardson's life 
was shaped by his parents, Irl, who was a Baptist pastor, and his 
mother, Pearl,

[[Page H7104]]

who was a dedicated homemaker. Gene excelled in both academics and 
athletics, all while running his own newspaper franchise.
  After earning his bachelor's degree in biology and graduating from 
Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Richardson embarked on a journey that 
would impact countless lives. At just 26, he established a family 
practice down in Sanderson, Texas, becoming the sole doctor for an 
entire rural county.
  When his calling led him to radiology, he brought innovation to the 
field, cofounding a mobile nuclear medicine company that brought 
advanced care to underserved hospitals across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Gene Richardson's service didn't stop at our 
borders. He founded the Ultrasound Fund for Latin America, providing 
equipment and training to small hospitals in Mexico, and he was very 
proud that he learned Spanish during that time.
  He later joined medical missions to Guatemala, walking miles through 
remote areas to deliver lifesaving care. His legacy of compassion 
crossed continents, touching lives in profound ways.
  Beyond his professional achievements, Gene was a man of deep faith 
and unshakeable love for his family. Married to his beloved Mary for 65 
years, he often reflected on their life together saying: I could not 
have chosen a more perfect helpmate.
  Together they raised two wonderful children, Gene Jr. and Kay, and 
cherished their three grandchildren.
  Gene's passion for life extended to music, travel, and education. He 
played trumpet in the Baylor marching band and added his rich bass 
voice to choirs and quartets well into his nineties. He was a good 
singer. He taught line dancing, and he jitterbugged with youthful 
enthusiasm.
  As a lifelong learner, he traveled the world discovering new cultures 
and inspiring others to do the same.
  In one of his final messages to his family, Gene reminded us of 
life's greatest gifts: faith, family, and friends. He said: God has 
given us grace and mercy. Let us use these gifts to enrich our 
relationships and to serve others.
  Dr. Richardson's life was a testament to just that, Mr. Speaker, the 
power of service, of faith, and of love.
  He leaves behind not only his beloved wife, Mary, and their family 
but also a legacy that will inspire generations.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with both joy and gratitude that I honor the life 
of this extraordinary man.
  May we all strive to live as Dr. Gene Richardson did, with 
generosity, with courage, and with a heart full of adventure.
  Dr. Gene Richardson, we will see you in the morning.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for that 
heartfelt tribute and for his important remarks concerning the issue 
regarding the National Defense Authorization Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).


                     Pacific Deterrence Initiative

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Tennessee (Mr. 
Rose) in leading this effort tonight and for all his great work on our 
messaging that we are doing as a Republican Conference to illustrate to 
the people of the country what it is we are trying to do and that is 
our belief that it will be good for America and, in this case with the 
NDAA, good for our military and the people who populate it.
  Regarding this NDAA, the point I want to make this round is that the 
NDAA puts real muscle behind countering China's aggression with $15.6 
billion for the Pacific deterrence initiative, which is about $5.7 
billion more than what the Biden administration thought was going to be 
adequate.
  We are covering gaps the administration ignored, funding $490 million 
toward critical Indo-Pacific command priorities to shore up operations 
and capabilities in the region.
  We are making it clear: Taiwan won't have to stand alone. This bill 
launches the Taiwan security cooperation initiative to send lethal aid 
where it is needed most.
  The joint training and trauma care programs will boost their 
readiness, while industrial base agreements make sure their defense 
capabilities and ours are solid.

  The U.S. is doubling down on its commitments to allies in the region. 
This isn't just talk. We are reaffirming congressional support with 
action. With so much aggression by China in the region and around the 
world, this is the least we should be doing for an ally such as Taiwan 
who is there for us when we need them.
  We are also demanding a deep dive into the troubling alliance between 
China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, the actors who are teaming up to 
challenge us in that region in the Pacific as well as the mayhem they 
are causing with their alliances in the Middle East and our issues with 
trying to help protect Israel whether it is going to be with Iran's 
efforts immediately or with whatever is going to happen in Syria now 
with Assad taken out.
  This bill gives counter-intelligence agents more tools to expose and 
crush Chinese Communist Party spies working to undermine us in any of 
these regions.
  There will be no more contracts with Chinese Communist Party-
affiliated contractors, labs, or universities. We are shutting down 
their access to our defense programs.
  Why we have to do that now, when it should have been our policy years 
ago, I am not sure, but it is just common sense. You don't want to have 
Chinese access toward our technology and their ability to have some 
kind of weight in how our defensive programs work.
  It bans the Department of Defense from buying Chinese tech like semi-
conductors and communications gear. Relying on China for anything 
critical is asking for trouble.
  Who knows how easy it might be for them to embed spy technology into 
some of these chips and into some of this other equipment that could 
send information that is critical to us out to a different source that 
they can then mine and use against us.
  From ship repairs to logistics hubs, this bill ramps up our ability 
to operate in the Indo-Pacific.
  We are even funding forward-deploying manufacturing because if China 
wants a fight, we will make sure we are ready for them on day one. Now 
nobody really wants to have a fight. Indeed, readiness and projecting 
strength is one of the best deterrents. The work we can do in the NDAA, 
whether it is in this Pacific deterrence initiative and the other 
related pieces or overall, it helps prevent war, and it helps prevent 
conflict in the United States. It brings confidence to its allies 
around the world and maybe just a little bit of fear to its enemies.
  That is what we hope to accomplish and continue building on for the 
rest of this year and on through the Trump administration.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LaMalfa) for sharing his thoughts on these important issues tonight, 
and I appreciate his remarks.
  Mr. Speaker, I will close by reiterating our support of our 
servicemen and -women who defend our great country. Many of us have 
highlighted the improvement in the quality of life they will receive 
from the passage of this bill and it being signed into law by the 
President.
  However, I would like to take a moment to highlight the impact it 
will have on Tennesseans serving in the armed services.
  According to the House Armed Services Committee, this bill will 
provide a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and 
an average 4\1/2\ percent pay raise for Tennessee's 19,500 
servicemembers.
  It also expands the program to help Tennessee's 1,500 military 
spouses attain and retain employment.
  Lastly, it expands access to childcare for the 2,800 children of 
military families in Tennessee.
  These important provisions to increase servicemembers' pay, expand 
childcare services, and bolster efforts to assist military spouses are 
much-needed and well-deserved.
  Servicemembers' families sacrifice a lot so that their loved ones can 
keep us safe. I am proud to support these provisions, and I am glad 
that they have been included in the final passage of the NDAA.
  When Americans elected President Donald Trump to serve as the 47th 
President of the United States, they sent a clear message: We must 
deter

[[Page H7105]]

our adversaries, eliminate our enemies, protect the homeland, and 
support our troops.
  That is exactly what this National Defense Authorization Act seeks to 
do. We are proud to see it pass and encourage the Senate to join us in 
passing this important legislation so that it can be sent to the 
President's desk to be signed into law.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who has joined me this evening, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

              DOING THE RIGHT THING REGARDLESS OF THE COST

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Good) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deep 
appreciation to the people of Virginia's Fifth District for the 
privilege of representing them these past 4 years. Being their 
Congressman has been the greatest honor of my professional life. When I 
answered the call 5 years ago to run for Congress, I identified as a 
Biblical and a constitutional conservative.
  I wanted the voters and my future constituents to know how I would 
make decisions, how I would represent them, and how I would vote on 
their behalf in Washington.
  I wanted them to know that my values and principles come from my 
Christian faith and my Biblical world view. I wanted them to know that 
my guiding political philosophy comes from the Constitution and its 
stated limits on Federal power.
  My allegiance as a Congressman has been to my creator, my Savior, the 
institution, the promises I made to my constituents, and to doing what 
I know is right regardless of the cost.
  My main priorities have been to cut spending, to shrink the Federal 
Government, to fight for America first border and immigration policies, 
and to protect our constitutional freedoms.
  As my time serving in this body on behalf of the citizens of 
Virginia's Fifth District comes to a close, I leave with no regrets 
because I have done as I told them I would do when I asked them to 
trust me with their vote and their support.
  My ultimate desire, however, has been to please the Lord, to be more 
concerned about offending Him by what I don't say than I am about 
offending others by what I do say.
  I didn't run for Congress promising to bring the money back home, to 
deliver the earmarks or the pork projects. I didn't run promising to 
work across the aisle, to compromise, or to find common ground, or to 
get things done. In fact, most of what we do here in Washington is bad, 
certainly unconstitutional, unjustified, and often downright harmful, 
not to mention we don't have the money, so the less we do, the better.
  In fact, we should be proud of the accusation that over the past 2 
years this Congress has done less than most Congresses.
  As Republicans, what should we have done more of that Biden and 
Schumer would agree to do?
  When I first ran for Congress in 2020, I presumed I would have the 
opportunity to serve with President Trump, help him build on the 
successes of his first term, and help him enact his second term agenda.
  Unfortunately, that has not been the case, and like most Republicans, 
my efforts have been by extreme necessity directed at fighting the 
Democratic agenda which has caused so much pain and suffering for the 
American people these past 4 years.
  That is because when Democrats seize power, they wield it without 
apology, and they ram through the radical agenda as they did in the 
first 2 years of the Biden administration with a narrow House majority 
and far less than 60 votes in the Senate.
  It is always about the money in Washington, and Democrats spent it 
lavishly and recklessly in 2021 and 2022 on their trillions for their 
ill-conceived and harmful COVID response, their inflation increase act, 
their phony infrastructure bill, and their radical climate agenda, all 
the while infusing every policy, department, and agency with their 
extreme pro-abortion, pro-transgender, pro-DEI, pro-CRT, and climate 
objectives.

                              {time}  1730

  Democrats are willing to lose elections to push and pull the Nation 
to the left, understanding that Republicans don't have the same 
political courage or willingness to risk their own elective futures to 
undo the harm, overturn the policies, or defund the programs.
  Thankfully, however, the American people responded to the extreme 
Democratic agenda by entrusting Republicans with the House majority 2 
years ago in the 2022 midterms. Unfortunately, this Republican House 
majority has been squandered by a lack of courage, a lack of principle, 
and a lack of steely resolve by Republican leadership and too many 
Republican Members these past 2 years.
  Again, it is all about the money, and House Republicans could have 
blocked, stopped, and defunded anything and everything that we wanted 
to these past 2 years. We could have just turned off the spigot and 
refused to give them the money. Instead, we have funded and perpetuated 
the Biden-Pelosi-Schumer policies and spending levels that we inherited 
and campaigned against that are bankrupting and destroying the country.
  The Constitution entrusts the House to manage the Nation's finances, 
the Nation's debt, the Nation's credit, and our ability to borrow money 
if and when necessary and to make the payments on that debt.
  However, our national debt has grown by some $5 trillion in the 2 
years that Republicans have controlled the purse strings. We are 
failing miserably. Every dollar we vote on is borrowed. Every dollar 
borrowed and spent steals from Americans through higher taxes, more 
inflation, and/or a greater debt burden for our kids and our grandkids.
  Over the past 2 years, House Republicans have given more money to 
Mayorkas for the border invasion. As a matter of fact, back in the 
spring, we gave him $3 billion more to bring more illegals in quicker.
  We have given more money to Attorney General Garland and FBI Director 
Wray to abuse their power and weaponize Federal law enforcement against 
their political opponents.
  House Republicans have continued funding Democrats' radical climate 
extremism, their pro-abortion agenda, their pro-LGBTQ policies, and 
their racist DEI-CRT agenda.
  Why has our party leadership been more afraid to do nothing than to 
do something bad? As the medical folks like to say: First, do no harm.
  However, with predominantly Democratic votes, typically 90 to even 
100 percent of Democratic votes in a Chamber with a Republican 
majority, our report card shows that, since electing our current 
Speaker 14 months ago, we have failed to cut $1 of spending and have 
instead continued a $200 billion monthly deficit.
  We have passed four CRs, or continuing resolutions, and two minibuses 
maintaining Democratic policies and spending levels from the Biden-
Pelosi-Schumer regime when they had full control.
  We reduced our majority by kicking out George Santos, who had a solid 
conservative voting record and had not been convicted of any crime.
  We passed an NDAA maintaining abortion funding, LGBTQ policies, 
climate priorities, DEI policies, and CRT training. We reauthorized 
FISA twice without a warrant amendment prohibiting illegal and 
unconstitutional surveillance of U.S. citizens without their knowledge, 
due process, or probable cause.
  We have borrowed and funded tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine 
and even Hamas. We borrowed and funded thousands of earmarks for tens 
of billions of dollars more to provide Members with political cover 
back home for the bad votes they take here.
  We passed a tax bill that gave more benefits to illegal aliens. We 
failed to use any leverage that we had with the House majority to 
secure our borders.
  Just last month, we increased mandatory or, really, automatic 
spending by $200 billion more.
  All of this has been done over the past 14 months with significantly 
more Democratic than Republican votes when we have the House majority.
  What if we had instead shocked the American people and summoned the 
courage and the resolve to just say,

[[Page H7106]]

``Heck no, not on our watch,'' and walked away and refused to fund the 
very destruction of the country, destruction that we campaigned 
against.
  What if we had told Biden and Schumer: You aren't getting the money 
unless you cut some spending and reverse some of these harmful, 
dangerous policies.
  Instead, we are today contemplating borrowing $115 billion more for a 
disaster supplemental--that is what we are calling it, anyway--on top 
of other inevitable year-end lameduck spending increases.
  Setting aside the lack of constitutional justification for the 
Federal Government being in the disaster relief or insurance business 
anyway, and why we would force middle America to fund relief for the 
coastal elites in these high-cost areas, setting aside the 
constitutionality or lack thereof of doing that, why would we even 
think about borrowing and giving $1 more to the Biden administration in 
the remaining weeks of their regime? Why would we give the politicized 
and weaponized FEMA any more money before the end of this year?
  On November 5, the American people, thankfully, rejected the radical 
Democratic policies under which they have suffered these past 4 years. 
It wasn't a question of a Democratic Presidential candidate or the 
messaging or voter turnout. The fact is, Americans don't want the 
extreme Democratic agenda. They have had enough. The only alternative 
was the Republicans.
  Thankfully, at least for us politically, Democrats still don't grasp 
that, but we must not squander this reprieve and this tremendous 
opportunity that we were given by the American people on November 5. 
Americans desperately need our help. They desperately need us to rise 
to the occasion and to meet the moment.
  It can't be business as usual or how it has been for the past few 
decades. The American people are counting on us. They must count on us. 
There is no plan B. It is on this body.
  We are in the position that Democrats were in 4 years ago. After the 
2020 election, they were in control of the White House with a narrow 
House and Senate majority. We are in the same position.

  Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, we have talked a lot today, and 
we heard a lot of talk today about unity in our party, but unity for 
what purpose? Is it just to have the majority, so we can be in the 
majority, so we can stay in the majority? Is that the purpose?
  Unity is impossible without a unifying mission. What is ours? The 
Democrats are clearly united in their agenda, the direction they want 
to take the country, and they will risk anything and everything to 
advance that.
  Why do we want the majority? Why do we want to have power? For what 
purpose? What are our nonnegotiables to keep that power? What, if 
anything, are we not willing to give up or surrender in the name of 
obtaining or retaining power?
  I have often told the Republican Conference that we will never change 
Washington or save our country until it becomes more important for us 
to leave here having made a difference than it is to see how long we 
can stay. For far too many, the primary goal is to be here and to stay 
here as long as we can, even to die here of natural causes, it seems, 
and everything else is subordinate to that objective.
  We cannot be unified if we are willing to fund the very things we 
claim to oppose because some in our party believe it will help them get 
elected. Our party cannot be the goal or the objective unto itself, and 
our purpose cannot simply be to win elections to have the majority.
  What are our sacred principles, values, and convictions that cannot 
and must not be surrendered in order to obtain or retain power? Mr. 
Speaker, are there any? For what, if anything, are we willing to risk 
losing power to fight for? Is there any issue that transcends politics 
and elections for us? What is our foundation upon which everything else 
rests?
  Many people across the country will express their knowledge of the 
First Amendment, which as my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Roy), has stated, the Founders should have stopped with ``Congress 
shall make no law.'' Just stop right there. Again, less is more.
  Whenever you ask somebody what the First Amendment protects or what 
the first right protected in the Constitution is, they will invariably 
say freedom of speech. I have almost never had anyone answer that 
question any differently when you ask them what the First Amendment 
protects or what the first right protected in the Constitution is. They 
will say freedom of speech. Of course, that is incorrect.
  The first right specifically protected in the Constitution, the first 
one enumerated in the Bill of Rights intended to protect the people 
from an oppressive Federal Government, is the freedom of religion. The 
Founders knew that the most basic, most fundamental, and most precious 
of rights is the freedom to worship or not to worship and the freedom 
to practice or not to practice our faith as we choose.
  You cannot separate America from our founding Judeo-Christian 
principles and a recognition of our supernatural creator, by whom and 
for whom we have our existence, our lives, our breath, and our very 
being. It is He, as our founding Declaration expresses, who has endowed 
us with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness.
  How can a party continue to call itself conservative if it no longer 
fights for absolute truth and natural law flowing from our creator?
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer protects 
innocent, precious life in the womb or looks the other way at the 
number one cause of death in this country, abortion, and funds it in 
policy, as some just voted to do today with the latest NDAA?
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer fights for 
Biblical morality, the traditional family, or the definition of 
marriage?
  In fact, I have said many times that almost everything that plagues 
our society and our country is a failure to follow God's design for 
morality, marriage, and the family.
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer fights for a 
commonsense, scientific definition of sex and gender and funds the 
LGBTQ agenda, as we have been doing for the past 4 years?
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer fights for 
the true equality of all and, instead, tolerates DEI and CRT, racist 
policies that we are funding?
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer fights for 
individual freedom, personal responsibility, and self-reliance, or if 
it no longer places a premium on work or believes that people have a 
responsibility to provide for themselves, but instead, the party funds 
government dependence and generational poverty?
  How can a party call itself conservative if it no longer fights for 
limited government, reduced spending, or fiscal responsibility and 
instead borrows and funds massive deficits?

  I often speak in my district about the little-known and little-
regarded Ninth and 10th Amendments to the Constitution. When you ask a 
group what the Ninth and 10th Amendments are, almost no one knows what 
those amendments are.
  The Ninth Amendment says: ``The enumeration in the Constitution, of 
certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others 
retained by the people.''
  What that means is we have every right that the Constitution doesn't 
prohibit to us. We retain all the others. Just because the Founders 
listed some rights doesn't mean we don't keep every other right.
  The 10th Amendment says: ``The powers not delegated to the United 
States,'' or the Federal Government, ``by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States 
respectively, or the people.''
  What the Founders were saying, of course, is the Federal Government 
had limited power, and everything else was supposed to be left to the 
people or the States.
  Almost everything we do in this body is unconstitutional and violates 
the Ninth and the 10th Amendments. We have strayed so far from these 
constitutional limits, as so many Republicans have embraced expanded 
Federal power, the growth of government, more spending, and diminished 
freedom for the individual.
  We consistently reduce the rights or freedoms of the people. We 
regularly

[[Page H7107]]

seize from the States and the people the power that should be left to 
them.
  Again, it is all about the money. It is all about the purse strings 
that are entrusted specifically to this body.
  We are in danger of fulfilling the famous quote attributed to 
Alexander Fraser Tytler. He said this a couple of hundred years ago:

       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. 
     It can only exist until the voters discover that they can 
     vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that 
     moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates 
     promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with 
     the result that a democracy always collapses over loose 
     fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship.

                              {time}  1745

  ``The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 
years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: From 
bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith to great courage, from 
courage to liberty, from liberty to abundance, from abundance to 
selfishness, from selfishness to apathy, from apathy to dependence, 
from dependence back into bondage.''
  May we determine not to accelerate that on our watch, not to let this 
happen on our watch. May we determine to leave those who come behind us 
a better America than we found it. May we determine to leave Congress 
having truly made a difference.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the citizens of Virginia's Fifth 
District for the privilege of representing them in Congress, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

          EVERY DIME A MEMBER OF CONGRESS VOTES ON IS BORROWED

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
Schweikert) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we have half an hour, so consider that a 
mercy for everyone who has had to deal with some of these 
presentations.
  The original goal tonight was actually to do some things that were a 
bit more optimistic, some things that we have identified where you 
could actually modernize and cut the cost of this government and 
actually do the job that we are supposed to do here, but I need to 
clear up a couple of things.
  First, I owe everyone--because apparently last week when I was 
speaking, I was speaking so fast that I didn't explain this particular 
chart, so I am making up for myself last week.
  The point I was trying to make is, in the last fiscal year, our 
borrowing represented about 6.4 percent of the entire economy. When you 
have individuals around here saying we have these parts of our 2017 tax 
reform that expire at the end of next year, if we just extend those and 
don't pay for them, that is what drives us to almost 9.2 percent of the 
entire economy 9 budget years from now.
  If we actually find a way to pay for them and still extend those tax 
reforms, we actually get some economic growth. If you just let 
everyone's taxes go up, you end up in about 9 years a little under 7 
percent of the entire economy borrowed.
  It is a little geeky, but the passion I have tried to show here is, I 
believe the moral thing to do is we don't let the portions on the 
middle class, their taxes, go up next year, but we also step up and 
find a way to pay for it. The CBO and the joint economic economists 
last week--and it is going to be one of the boards here--actually 
showed if you paid for the tax extensions at the end of the decade, the 
economy has gotten bigger and it will make sense.
  You haven't taken, functionally, what would be $4.6 trillion out of 
the economy and used it for borrowing, you have left it there so the 
small business, the big business, your family, there is money that you 
can borrow to grow and at the same time your taxes haven't gone up.
  It is just hard for us to do because if we do modernization, if we 
find things to cut, there is an army of lobbyists just outside this 
door coming to scream at us. Some of those lobbyists aren't the types 
of people walking around with Guccis, they are the people they fly in 
from our home districts saying, David, we want that spending and then 
you explain to them: Every dime--I will say this three or four times 
because for some reason, I can't get this to burn in. Every dime a 
Member of Congress votes on is borrowed. Every dime of Defense is 
borrowed. Every dime in nondefense discretionary is borrowed. When you 
hear us all talk about the mandatory spending, and that is like three-
quarters of all spending, believe it or not, there may be $300 billion 
or $400 billion of that that is borrowed money also.
  I will apologize to everyone. When I was showing the 9.2 percent of 
GDP in 9 budget years, that is if we basically take these tax 
expirations and just ignore them and just continue current policy, we 
blow ourselves up.
  There are a couple of other things I want to walk through. 
Apparently, yesterday, the President got up and was trying to tell 
everyone that this is the best economy ever. That is an interesting 
statement.
  The economy is actually not bad. Now, there is some argument to be 
made about the amount of cash the Democrats did in their Inflation 
Reduction Act and other things that they have been, functionally, 
subsidizing and then borrowing.
  Here is the reality: If the President is looking at you in the camera 
and telling you it is the best economy ever, well, that is not factual, 
but why don't you feel it? It is because much of America is poorer 
today than the day President Biden took office.
  If you live in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area, my home, if you don't 
make almost 27 percent more today than the day President Biden took 
office, you are poorer.
  So having someone tell you the economy is great, yet you are having 
trouble paying for things--the reason we made this board is, 
functionally, for you to maintain your purchasing power, are you 
making, if you are an average person in average America--in my 
district, these numbers are substantially higher because I am from a 
district with some of the highest inflation in America, but if you are 
not making $1,115 more a month because that is what you would have to 
be having from 4 years ago, your purchasing power, you are poorer.
  I actually think that is the reason that voters turned and said, I 
see these Democrats running lots of ads, saying crazy things, but yet 
it turns out the voters are actually really smart. They would look at 
their checking account, they would look at the cost of their kids' 
clothes, they would look at the grocery store and try to figure out why 
in the last week of the month they were losing their minds under 
stress.

  There are a lot of folks here that say things that, just from an 
economist standpoint, are insane. But your wages, policies that we 
engage in that don't make you wealthier--because prosperity is moral. 
It is moral for the poor person to be less poor. It is moral for the 
working person to be less stressed. To not understand the average 
American in 4-some years, unless you are making about $13,000 more, you 
are poorer.
  In my district, I think that number is closer to $18,000, $19,000 
because I have one of the higher income districts in America, but also 
one with the highest inflation, and I think that is the disconnect. I 
think that understanding of, it's not enough to run around and tell 
people the economy is great, look at all the money we have handed out 
to big businesses, aren't you happy how much we subsidized of the 
economy, while so many Americans are just trying to survive.
  Apparently, I did a horrible job trying to explain--and somewhere 
here in early January, I will do a whole presentation on this--one of 
the fixations of the left is, we need to tax corporations more.
  Do you remember your elementary school economics class? I am being 
sarcastic.
  Do you remember your high school economics class?
  A corporation taxes you. Who pays it? Seriously, you don't think that 
doesn't pop up in the wages you pay your workers and the prices you pay 
as a consumer.
  In many ways, corporations are nothing more than pass-through 
entities. When we did the tax reform at the end of 2017, there was data 
that was coming out in the next couple of years that

[[Page H7108]]

showed about 67 percent of those corporate tax cuts actually worked 
their way into wages.
  Remember, before the pandemic we had some of the most robust growth 
of wages in American history where the poorer got less poor. The 
wealthy did well. Now, there is a whole discussion of--one day I am 
going to do a whole thing of what this government, the Federal Reserve 
did to inflate assets and that is actually where much of the wealth 
came from was monetary policy, not tax policy, but for the folks around 
here that don't do economics that is a different discussion.
  What happens in a world where you can show we lowered taxes?
  It actually turns out we did something more complicated than that. 
You do realize what we call the TCJA, in 2017, there was $7 trillion 
over 10 years of tax cuts. You know there was like $5 trillion, $5.5 
trillion of tax hikes.
  Because the idea was to modernize. It had been 30-some years since 
the United States had updated its tax code, and much of the rest of the 
world was kicking our heads in.
  Do you remember the stories that President Obama said over and over 
and over, he talked about these companies are leaving America? They are 
moving their intellectual property to Ireland and these things.
  We fixed that. We made it so you wanted to be domiciled in the United 
States. That is why we had the miracle of job growth, but also the wage 
growth.
  Before the pandemic, we had the fastest closure of income inequality 
in modern history in America. I would argue that is moral. When you get 
economic policy, when you get tax policy, when you get regulatory 
policy right, it is moral. People are less poor. Yet, so often I watch 
these people come behind these microphones and they say things that 
aren't true.
  I was trying to point out in last week's presentation, just if you 
look at expenditures on growth and growing businesses and investments, 
when we did TCJA, you can actually see--the G7, without the United 
States in it, they were growing about the same. They were investing 
about the same. We exploded in growth.
  So back to your high school economics class.
  What are the two ways you pay people more? Your wages go up. So you 
are out there in the private sector, not government because we are a 
distortion.
  What are the two ways your wages go up?
  Come on. You all showed up for your high school economics class.
  With inflation, your wages go up. But that just means you are 
treading water. You got paid more because everything costs more.
  It is productivity. Things in the tax code, in the regulatory code 
that get a business to buy the new piece of equipment that is better, 
faster, cheaper. Those investments in capital equipment, you are able 
to make more of whatever you do. Your employer is able to pay you more. 
It is how you create wage growth.
  Some of the idiot class here say we are just going to tax businesses 
more.
  You do realize every economic model says when I raise corporate 
taxes, it is the workers that ultimately pay for it because your wage 
growth flattens out, but it is great politics. It is crap economics.
  I did this earlier in the year. I brought all these charts trying to 
show that much of the wealth of this country, thank heaven, before the 
insanity of the pandemic, we had had the tax reform, the regulatory 
reform, and a robust economic growth.
  Could you imagine if this country was at an anemic growth rate when 
that happened, what our lives would have been like?
  It is also one of the reasons we exploded out and we spent too damn 
much money. There was too much fear, a number of stupid policies that, 
hopefully, we will put into the history books that no one else will 
repeat.
  The fact that we had modernized the tax code is what has given us a 
fight. When President Biden, yesterday was taking credit for a great 
economy, I sure hope he looked in the camera and said, thank you 
Republicans, for modernizing our tax code so we maximized economic 
expansion and had corporate stability.
  Because much of the wealth that this country, much of the 
opportunity, much of the employment base, and the way we can afford 
that is because we have a competitive tax code now where the rest of 
the world stops stealing our jobs.

                              {time}  1800

  One other thing I want to help people try to understand--because 
every time I go near this subject I get people--because their brains 
are sort of caught--I don't mean to say this in a mean way. I am not 
trying to be mean.
  All right, let me walk through a concept. Mr. Speaker, you are from a 
State that produces hydrocarbons, oil, things of that nature. Back in 
the 1970s and 1980s, do you remember the posters, ``No war for oil''? 
The world competed with each other for hydrocarbons.
  I had a professor back when I was a younger student who was famous 
for writing these papers about peak oil, the world is going to run out 
of hydrocarbons. Well, it turns out that was completely wrong because 
he didn't understand the ingenuity that God gave us as humans and how 
we found technology to get to those hydrocarbons that in a previous 
decade were impossible.
  The point where I am going on this rambling, in the 1970s, 1980s, the 
world basically fought for hydrocarbons. Last decade, in many ways, we 
positioned ourselves for rare earths because that was the future 
economic of the world economy.
  Really, really smart economists right now are saying this decade, the 
next decade, and the decade after that, do you know what the world is 
going to compete over? Smart people. The entire industrialized world is 
starting to, if not collapse, dramatically fall.
  You see the things going on in South Korea, Taiwan, and much of 
Europe. The numbers are happening all around us. The United States, if 
you look at some of the Census Bureau data--and I said this last week--
it could be as early as 11 years from now the United States will start 
having more deaths than births.
  What would happen to you if I came to you and said, let's have an 
honest conversation--which is almost impossible around here--about the 
border and immigration, but we are going to talk about it like 
economists? Not our hearts, not our passions, not our anger. 
Economists.
  What President Biden has allowed at the border, when you bring 
millions of people into the country with very moderate skill sets, what 
did you do to your domestic working poor? I have done a whole 
presentation here showing that that family, that young man, that young 
woman, they dropped out of high school. They sell their willingness to 
work. They are out hanging drywall; they are out doing this. What 
happens to their wage growth? You remember a moment ago we were talking 
about wage growth. What happens to their wage growth in a society when 
you have added millions and millions and millions of people with 
similar skill sets? You crush the working poor.
  This is actually why, if you look a couple decades ago, it was the 
Democrats, back when they gave a darn about working people, that 
actually cared about locking down the border, about taking on low-
skilled immigration.
  Those of us from border States, you see the chaos we have had to deal 
with. It drives us insane. A bus showed up in New York or Chicago, and 
they lose their minds, and you look at some of the Members of Congress 
from those States, you look at them and you say, you have been doing 
this to us for years, and now you figured out what we go through every 
single day?
  But back to the economists.
  The morality of when you flood a country with a certain level of 
skill set, you just made your working poor poorer. There is an economic 
model out there that says it will be 10 years before the domestic 
working poor in America start to really see their wages go up outside 
inflation, and it is just because of population dynamics: How many 
other people are willing to sell their labor cheaper than they are 
willing?
  Flip side--and President Trump actually hit this and hit this 
brilliantly--we are insane. We bring in smart people from all over the 
world to our universities, and we educate them. We

[[Page H7109]]

teach them our engineering, we teach them our biology, we teach them 
things, and then we send them home to compete against us.
  In a time where you need the society to become more productive--
remember, back to our high school education. As society becomes more 
productive, our wages go up. When wages go up, we actually take in more 
tax receipts, but that is a side benefit. Wages go up in a productive 
society, and then there is a cascade event. You may not be the person 
with the Ph.D. in synthetic biology, but your wages go up when that 
person down the street is making a hell of a lot of money and changing 
the society and the economy for the future and the better.
  It turns out this last summer we unleashed some of my Joint Economic 
economists to just try to do some of the math. Here is what I was 
talking about with low-skilled immigration. Asylum seekers, those, they 
consume hundreds of thousands of dollars of social services. That is 
the nature of our country. If you can't afford it, you get healthcare. 
If you can't afford it, you get these other type of benefits. If you 
can't afford it, we will get you housing. Our education system is based 
off the tax system.
  High skill, we actually make millions--well, in this case $800,000, 
$900,000--in the tax receipts and those things over a full career. Now, 
the fact of the matter is, I have some much fancier graphs that also 
show the age spectrum. You have got to say a young worker compared to 
an older worker, the number of years they are able to participate in 
the economy at a higher wage level. Bingo.
  That is actually why Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, 
the rest of the world we compete with have all gone to a point talent-
based system. We are functionally the last country, last industrial 
country in the world that does a familial system.
  I promise you, I will get some very angry things coming into my 
office, but I am being honest. Our immigration system is essentially 
based on who your family is: My cousin moved in, they are sponsoring 
me. It is a family chain migration system.
  The rest of the world has figured out that as birth rates have 
collapsed around the world, people, we are desperate for people. I am 
going to show you some charts coming where, as a country, that our 
birthrate started to roll over in 1990. We need people.

  Part of my job with the Joint Economic Committee, part of my job on 
Ways and Means is how do I finance all the things that people show up 
here wanting?
  I know it is not something you hear a lot of Republicans talk about 
because so many people don't understand the demographics of our 
country. We are going to have to have an honest discussion that one of 
the most powerful things we can do for economic growth is actually 
modernizing our immigration system, not sending home people that we 
educate to compete with us.
  There are models out there that say it would make our entire society 
more prosperous. It is worth thinking about.
  Actually, can I give you just a thought experiment? I was trying to 
explain this to a reporter earlier today. One of the things that is 
expiring from our 2017 tax reform is research and development 
expensing. You go, huh? If you are a business and you are researching a 
new way to make something, a new piece of technology, a new type of 
biology, a new cure for a disease, in 2017 what we did was we made it 
so you could expense it right then.
  In today's tax code, you basically depreciate it. It says, okay, you 
spend a million dollars trying to build a new tool, and you get to 
amortize that research over the next 7 years.
  Think about this. If I expense it in one day or do it over 7 years, 
the government basically gets the same money, right? It is just the 
timing. If you have the ability to say, I spent the money, I expensed 
it immediately, what happens? You get this virtual cycle of, oh, I have 
a new tool that is better, faster, cheaper, and then you jump onto the 
next one, and jump onto the next one, and you get that productivity 
curve.
  You get back to productivity again. How do you pay people more money?
  One of the complaints we were getting after 2017 is that all this 
money was going into research and development to make a society more 
prosperous, more modern--you know, better, faster ways to cure people--
and we had a shortage of people with skill sets.
  One of our economists is trying to model what would happen if you 
said we are going to do expensing of research and development, because 
we know that pops economic growth, but you also did talent-based 
immigration at the same time. You may get a multiplier effect. This is 
thinking like an economist. This is what we have to do to get ourselves 
out of this hole.
  Remember, functionally, the first 2 months of what we call this 
fiscal year, we are borrowing about $10 billion a day. If you do the 
whole 12 months and be a little more honest about what you are doing, 
because here is the April tax cycle, we are still borrowing about 
$74,000, $75,000 a second. It just gets worse, and it gets worse 
because of demographics.
  I am going to show this twice, but I have to say it again. Close to 
100 percent of the debt for the next 10 years is interest and 
healthcare. It is people like me. It is baby boomers. It is not 
Republican or Democrat. It is math, except it is also the type of math 
we are not allowed to really talk about here.
  Look, I am going to race through a couple of these boards just to 
make a point. For every dollar we take in in tax receipts, we spend 
$1.39. Does that give you a sense--when I have someone who comes to me 
and says, David, there is a continuing resolution coming.
  Now, we actually, probably as Republicans, would want to move that 
continuing resolution when we have President Trump so we have unified 
Republican government so maybe we could do some of the policy changes, 
but how about the debt ceiling?
  We are also going to do a slide here on talking about, do you 
understand when you say: David, I don't want you to borrow a dime. 
Great. I take in a dollar, I spend $1.39, but all I get to vote on is 
about 25 percent of the spending.
  How much of Medicare, how much Social Security, how much pension 
benefits, how much of VA benefits do you want us to cut?
  I have done these entire presentations at home where you show the 
chart, and people raise their hand. I get these suggestions. I will 
give you an example, I had one last night, a good friend sends me a 
thing: David, if you would stop funding the U.N., that would take care 
of our problems. Okay, we spend about $18 billion on the U.N. The 
economic effect, it is believed, it probably brings in about $9 billion 
a year, but let's just use the entire $18 billion. If we are borrowing 
close to $7 billion a day, getting rid of all the U.N. covers 2\2/3\ of 
a day worth of borrowing.
  There is the problem. People don't understand the scale. Every dime a 
Member of Congress votes on--all defense, all nondefense 
discretionary--is on borrowed money plus a chunk of mandatory. You have 
got to see. When we do that presentation in our home district and you 
have people give their suggestions, we get up to maybe 3 weeks of cuts.

  Then you start to say: Okay, are you ready to get rid of all the 
Defense Department? Are you ready to get rid of the State Department? 
Are you ready to get rid of the FBI? Are you ready to get rid of this, 
ready to get rid of that? You just see the eyes on people because they 
really do believe, if we get rid of foreign aid we can balance the 
budget. Then you show them that all foreign aid is about 9 days of 
borrowing.
  I beg of the public, the way you influence Members of Congress is 
know your math and know the scale of how upside down we are.
  Just trying to make that point once again, here is another chart. If 
we are spending $1.39 for every $1 we take in, this little dot line is 
the break-even point. That basically means every dime of 
discretionary--that is defense, too, and you have got to pay interest. 
If you don't pay your interest, you blow up the world and you blow us 
up because we have the bonds out there, so functionally we are so 
upside down, even part of what we call entitlements, mandatory, earned 
benefits is on borrowed money.
  Mr. Speaker, may I ask how many minutes I have remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona has 2\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.

[[Page H7110]]

  

  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. All right, I am going to talk faster. Sorry about 
that. Oh, the poor people who try to take our words down. It is a 
punishment, I am sorry.
  I have some other boards here, so I am just going to try to do two 
more boards in this 2 minutes.
  Tax policy, you go back to functionally 1950, when we have had very 
high marginal tax rates, we get about 17, 18 percent of the economy in 
tax receipts. When we have had very low marginal tax rates, we get 
about 17, 18 percent of the economy in tax receipts.
  The fact of the matter is, for some reason, the American economy for 
the last 75 years, we fall back into this mean, so you have Democrats 
running around here saying, we need much higher marginal tax rates. 
However, when we have done that, we still just get the same percentage 
of the economy. The secret, once again, is that productivity, have a 
bigger economy.

                              {time}  1815

  Our structural crisis now is if we are getting 17, 18 percent of the 
economy in tax receipts, we are spending about 24 percent of the 
economy year after year.
  Back to the point, this is the pie chart. Every dime of nondefense is 
borrowed. Every dime of defense is borrowed. You have to pay your 
interest. Remember, interest is now our second-biggest expense in 
government. It is number two now. Part of this red here is also on 
borrowed money.
  There are ways to make the math work--the willingness to modernize 
this government, the willingness to use technology to crash the price 
of this government, crash the price of healthcare, but make us a 
healthier society. There is a way.
  I sometimes just feel like an idiot. I come behind this microphone 
every week. I do charts. I show these things, here are the ways. Last 
week, I showed I think $100 billion, $200 billion of savings we could 
have in government by just modernization. There is hope, but I only 
think we have maybe 3 or 4 more years to start to understand how 
upside-down we are.
  Mr. Speaker, I know I am out of time. I thank you for your patience. 
There is hope, but there is only hope if the American people start to 
hear these words and start to push those of us in Congress to do the 
right thing.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                 Nomination of Lauren McGarity McFerran

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, later this morning, the Senate will vote 
to advance the nomination of Lauren McFerran to serve another term as a 
member of the National Labor Relations Board.
  Ms. McFerran has served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where 
she is known for her fairness, deep expertise, and guiding the Board to 
deal with the challenges of the contemporary workplace. She worked in 
the Senate for our former colleagues Tom Harkin and the late Ted 
Kennedy.
  If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing 
income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing 
today's NLRB nominee. You can't say you are for working families and 
then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from 
mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.


                               hearts act

  Mr. President, on the HEARTS Act passage, last night, in a great 
moment, the Senate finally reached the end zone of the HEARTS Act, a 
bill I have worked on for months with Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills 
to better prepare schools against cardiac emergencies. The HEARTS Act 
is now on the way to President Biden's desk. By doing so, we are 
ensuring that every school has access to AEDs and the ability to teach 
CPR.
  The HEARTS Act will save lives, plain and simple. God forbid a child 
goes into cardiac arrest while at school or a young athlete suffers an 
emergency on the field, but thanks to the HEARTS Act, there will soon 
be more AEDs nearby to save them like they saved Damar Hamlin.
  I am so proud to have worked with Damar to get this bill passed. He 
is an amazing man. Together, I must say, Damar and I--unlikely as it 
may seem--have been a great team. After he suffered from cardiac arrest 
in the middle of a football game, Damar didn't just sit around; he came 
to visit me in Washington and told me he wanted to ``make history'' and 
ensure more kids in schools have access to the same AEDs that saved 
Damar's life. Last night, finally, history was made when we passed this 
bill that Damar and I proudly led.
  So thank you, Damar Hamlin. You are both a strong and humble man. It

[[Page S6942]]

is a rare combination. Thank you to the Buffalo Bills. Thank you to the 
NFL and Roger Goodell. Thank you to all the student athletes and great 
champions in Buffalo and everywhere who pushed for this bill. They all 
made it happen.

                      Tribute to Thomas R. Carper

  Mr. President, about my dear friend Senator Carper, this week, two of 
our longtime Democratic colleagues have delivered farewell addresses, 
Senators Tester and Cardin.
  Today, another Senator, another dear friend, will deliver his 
farewell address: the senior Senator from Delaware--Tom Carper. And 
when I say ``dear friends'' about these individuals, it is really true. 
It is not just verbiage. We are really friends as we have become in 
this caucus, and that is certainly true of Tom Carper.
  Last night was the annual Taste of Delaware event, one of my favorite 
events of the year, where everything that is amazing about Delaware is 
on full display. And if you spend just a few minutes there, you will 
notice something: The State of Delaware loves Tom Carper, and Tom 
Carper loves Delaware.
  He hates being away from home, which is why half the time when I call 
him about all the issues that we care about together, he is on that 
Amtrak, hopping home to be with Martha and his family. He does it even 
on weekdays while we are in session.
  Serving Delaware is all Tom knows. He did it first as State 
treasurer, then Congressman, then Governor, and then, for the last two 
decades, as Senator. If you put all these elected offices together, it 
means the people of Delaware have elected and reelected Tom a record 14 
times into office, and he never lost an ounce of fight.
  Here in the Senate, what a great ambassador he was for the First 
State. Our caucus relied on Tom's expertise, not just about Delaware, 
which, of course, we became quite familiar with due to his persistence 
but also on many different issues, especially when it came to the 
environment.
  Tom is a climate warrior, plain and simple. Few Senators have fought 
as long or as hard to take action against the climate crisis as Tom 
has. As chair of the EPW Committee, he expertly negotiated many of the 
climate and clean energy investments we secured in recent years and had 
great input into the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act.
  And Tom was both idealistic and practical. When he worked on 
environmental issues, he knew how important it was to maximize the 
amount of clean energy we produce, but at the same time, he knew how to 
talk to Members on the other side of the aisle, Members who might not 
agree with him on everything and get them to support a coalition that 
would support that legislation. He was amazing in action.
  As the Senate's last Vietnam war veteran, Tom was also an unflinching 
champion for our servicemembers and their families. Tom will tell you 
that despite his time in elected office, his greatest privilege was 
serving in the Navy for 23 years. And not a day goes by when Tom isn't 
looking for ways to help our veterans in need.
  He is an amazing guy. I even had a nickname for him. Tom and I love 
old lyrics from the fifties, sixties, and seventies, both songs, music, 
but TV shows, so his nickname, his initials, for me, were TC, Top Cat. 
He and I are among the few in this Chamber who remember the cartoon 
``Top Cat,'' but Tom Carper was certainly a Top Cat in this body. Top 
Cat, you are great. I will miss you.
  A final testament to Tom's willingness to go out of his way to help 
others, he was so enthusiastic about his successor, Lisa Blunt 
Rochester. She got her start in politics as an intern in Tom's office, 
and when he knew he wasn't going to run, one of the first things he 
said to me was: Make sure you help Lisa Blunt Rochester. She will be a 
great Senator. And we can begin to see that already.
  So I can't think of a more appropriate way to conclude a long career 
in public service than by making sure your successor can continue your 
legacy. Senator Moynihan did that, in many ways, with me.
  So to Tom, to Martha, the entire family, his two sons, thank you, 
thank you, thank you for your service. We will miss you very much.
  And in the words a Navy man can appreciate: We wish you fair winds 
and following seas.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant executive clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  The Senator from Illinois.

                    Water Recourses Development Act

  Mr. President, on WRDA, last night, the House of Representatives 
overwhelmingly passed the 2024 Water Resources Development Act, named 
this year in honor of our dear retiring friend Senator Carper, who has 
been a champion of this bill for so long. WRDA is one of Congress's 
most important bills for water infrastructure projects carried out by 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The bill passed with resounding 
bipartisan support--399 to 18--in the House, with all Democrats in 
favor.
  This year's bill also includes reauthorization of the Economic 
Development Administration and several regional Commissions, making 
critical investments in infrastructure, workforce, and supply chains 
that will help the United States outcompete the rest of the world.
  This bipartisan bill passed out of the EPW Committee earlier this 
year with unanimous support. The Senate is now working on a path to get 
WRDA and the EDA package cleared through this Chamber. It is my hope we 
can act on these bipartisan bills as soon as possible.
  Reauthorizing WRDA opens the floodgates to authorize all sorts of 
water-related projects for our economy. It helps improve our ports and 
inland waterways. It helps communities protect against flood damage. It 
safeguards our delicate ecosystems, and it enhances access to public 
water.
  WRDA is also critical for New York, where it improves, among other 
things, shoreline resiliency and flood protections from the Great Lakes 
all the way to New York City. The EDA authorization part of the bill 
will also direct more Federal investment to our most distressed regions 
and help them rebuild from economic hardship and from disasters.
  WRDA and EDA are great examples of bipartisanship in action. So I 
hope we can reach agreement to get this important bill done as soon as 
we can.

                          Cabinet Nominations

  Mr. President, later today, I will meet with the President-elect's 
pick to serve as the next Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick of New 
York. I look forward to a fruitful and positive discussion. I have 
known Howard Lutnick for many years. He is an intelligent and capable 
man.
  I think it is very important for New York and every other State and 
for America that the next Commerce Secretary is willing to build on the 
progress of the last few years and help the United States outcompete 
the Chinese Communist Party on AI, chip manufacturing, and in many 
other areas as well. It is especially important for States like New 
York and many others where we are bringing manufacturing back from 
overseas to strengthen domestic supply chains and our national 
security.
  I can assure Howard Lutnick and all of the President-elect's nominees 
that we will give them fair and thorough consideration in the Senate. 
As I said in my letter to Senator Thune last week, it is important that 
everyone goes through the standard process nominees have always had, 
including access to full FBI investigation materials, hearings with 
questions, and a vote on the floor.
  I look forward to my conversation with Howard Lutnick later today.

                        Tribute to Sherrod Brown

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, on the floor, I thanked five of 
my colleagues in the Senate who will be leaving at the end of this 
Congress. Today, I would like to thank three more.
  If you read any profile on Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, there is a 
good chance you will see the word ``rumpled'' in the description of his 
presentation before the Senate. A rumpled suit has become his 
trademark. In

[[Page S6943]]

fact, George Will once wrote that Sherrod ``radiates rumpledness, even 
in a well-pressed suit.''
  Such characterizations have never seemed to bother Sherrod because, 
you see, he didn't come here to be a clothes horse or pose for GQ. He 
wouldn't know what to do with a custom-made, clean-pressed suit every 
day at work.
  Sherrod Brown has spent 50 years in public office--50--including the 
last 18 years in the Senate. He is the kind of person who comes to the 
Senate ready to fight for people who don't have lawyers and lobbyists 
to speak for them.
  Sherrod grew up in Mansfield, OH, a town hit hard and early by the 
decline in American manufacturing. His family was comfortably middle 
class, but many of his friends and seatmates in school weren't so 
lucky. When a factory in the town closed, his friends' families 
struggled and worried. Sherrod has spent his life trying to make those 
families, and others like them, in a position to get a fair shake.
  It is a noble kind of service to feel the burdens of others and to 
work to ease their load, even when you don't need help yourself. 
Sherrod's solidarity with others who needed help was evident when, for 
years, he even refused to take congressional health benefits until we 
passed the Affordable Care Act, which made them available to almost 
every American. He didn't think it was right to accept that benefit as 
long as tens of millions of Americans were unable to obtain quality, 
affordable healthcare.
  Sherrod has spent his life working for an economy and government that 
cares about the working class and invests in towns, factories, 
healthcare, and the potential of working families. He has fought for 
fair trade deals and opposed trade agreements that he thought 
shortchanged American workers, even when his opposition put him at odds 
with the President of his own party.
  He insisted that the historic bipartisan infrastructure bill include 
a ``Buy America'' requirement, and he helped save the pensions of 1.5 
million union members and retirees, with the so-called Butch Lewis Act, 
which I was proud to join him on.
  Today, two huge new Intel computer chip factories are being built in 
Ohio in New Albany because Sherrod Brown helped pass the Chips and 
Science Act.
  As a long-time member and, since 2021, chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, he has worked to prevent the kinds of Wall Street 
recklessness and greed that crashed the global economy in 2008. He has 
fought for affordable housing and consumer protection, and against 
predatory lending and exorbitant junk fees. He has worked to hold 
executives of failed banks accountable and to make sure that AI and 
technology advances help consumers and aren't misused to rig the system 
in favor of the wealthy.
  He worked so hard and was so gratified by the child tax credit. I 
think it was one of his proudest achievements, and he said as much.
  In 2002, in the House, he voted against the Iraq war. I did, too, in 
the Senate. There weren't many of us at the time, and it wasn't a 
popular stand, but it was the right thing to do, and Sherrod knew it.
  I am going to miss his gravelly, Tom Waits voice in this Chamber. I 
am going to miss the many stories he brought back about his wonderful 
wife Connie. She is a great writer and has been recognized beyond the 
United States in many places around the world for her insight and her 
writing. I wish the best to both of them. Their work here may be 
finished for the time being, but they have left a positive mark on 
America.

                         Tribute to Jon Tester

  Mr. President, the big man from Big Sky Country, Jon Tester--before 
his election to the Senate, 18 years ago, Senator Jon Tester had never 
lived more than 2 hours away from his family's wheat farm in Big Sandy, 
MT, the same farm his grandparents homesteaded more than a century ago.
  Jon started his campaign for the U.S. Senate traveling across the 
State on a farm tractor-trailer. And with his seven fingers, Roger 
Maris flattop, and scuffed size-12 cowboy boots, he has cut a singular 
figure in the Halls of Congress. He is a prairie pragmatist and a 
defender of programs that many rural Americans depend upon, such as 
market fairness for family cattle ranchers and rural community 
development efforts.
  Jon voted for the Affordable Care Act because it was right and 
because it is a lifeline to rural hospitals, to farmers, ranchers, 
small business owners, and others who need affordable, accessible 
healthcare coverage.
  He has been a strong voice for Native Americans. Growing up, Jon 
played ``Taps'' at the funerals of World War II veterans. It taught 
him, at an early age, that many veterans continue to pay a price for 
their service for the rest of their lives.
  He gave a speech on the floor of the Senate, just a day or two ago. 
He pointed to that moment in the funeral service for former Senator Dan 
Inouye, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, where, in 
Hawaii, Jon was called on to play ``Taps'' for Senator Inouye. He said 
it was one of his proudest moments, and I am sure that is true.
  When I think of the giants of the Senate, like Dan Inouye, I think 
about those like Jon Tester who, in his own way, showed his courage 
time and again.
  As chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Jon Tester has 
worked to strengthen VA healthcare and protect disability benefits for 
all veterans. He pushed the Senate to pass the historic PACT Act to 
provide healthcare for veterans who were sickened by exposure to burn 
pits and other toxins and the survivor benefits for their spouses and 
young children. As of last week, the VA has approved more than 1.3 
million claims under the PACT Act, including more than 51,000 veterans 
in my State of Illinois.
  By the way, you likely have been hearing about self-professed 
``efficiency experts'' combing through the Federal budget. Some of them 
have even called for the elimination of the Veterans Health 
Administration. They are wrong. They should listen to Jon Tester, a 
patriot, who it has been an honor to work with and count as a friend.
  And you can't close with Jon without mentioning Shar. His wife Shar 
has been his partner in life and in politics and in every step they 
have taken together. It is a wonderful, loving, caring, inspiring 
couple. I am going to miss their physical presence, but their memories 
will live on in the Senate.


                    Tribute to Robert P. Casey, Jr.

  Mr. President, it was the evening of January 28, 2017, in the early 
days of the first Trump administration. Airports in Chicago and 
throughout the Nation were filled with people protesting the 
administration's early ban on travelers from majority-Muslim nations. 
Among more than 100 protesters at the Philadelphia International 
Airport, one man stood out. Dressed in a tuxedo and tails, he had just 
attended a black-tie function when he heard about President Trump's 
decision. That man was Senator Bob Casey. He went directly to the 
airport.
  As we all know, Senator Casey isn't usually so flashy as to wear a 
tux, but his principles guide him in everything he does. Bob Casey is 
one of the most decent people I have ever served in Congress with. He 
is a bridge builder. He is committed to creating dialogue and finding 
common ground. He is the only--the only--Pennsylvania Democrat ever to 
serve three terms in the U.S. Senate.
  He has been a strong voice for working families struggling to get by. 
He has a great family himself with Terese. Poor mothers and children, 
coal miners at risk, and others finally had an advocate here standing 
up for them in the U.S. Senate.
  As chair of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, he has protected 
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He helped lower seniors' cost 
for prescription drugs--a promise that was made years ago and finally 
kept, thanks to Bob Casey. He has targeted scam artists who prey on 
seniors.
  Bob's father was a popular, two-term Pennsylvania Governor. And while 
Robert Casey, Sr., may have embedded the Casey name in Pennsylvania 
political life, Robert Casey, Jr., through his decades of service, has 
added new honor to that name.

                         Tribute to Mitt Romney

  Mr. President, finally, I want to say thank you to a departing 
Senator from across the aisle.
  On the evening of January 6, 2021, many Senators in both political 
parties

[[Page S6944]]

denounced the violent assault on this Capitol. But I believe history 
will record that the truest, bravest words spoken that night were from 
Senator Mitt Romney of Utah. He said:

       In light of today's sad circumstances, I ask my colleagues: 
     Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we 
     weigh the strength of our Republic, the strength of our 
     democracy, and the cause of freedom?

  Senator Mitt Romney is a man of deep faith and considerable 
accomplishments: a successful businessman, the rescuer of the 2002 
Olympics, a Republican Governor in a deep blue State, and his party's 
nominee for President in 2012.
  After he had been here a few months, I went up to him on the floor, 
and I said: The more I get to know you, Mitt Romney, the more I wonder 
why I said all those things about you in that Presidential campaign.
  He laughed, and I did too.
  He is a conservative, but he is a man of conscience and character. We 
would all do well to ponder his question and emulate his courage.
  I will miss Senators Brown, Tester, Casey, and Romney, and our other 
departing colleagues, and I join a grateful nation in thanking them for 
all that they have given, sacrificed, and contributed to us.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.

                         Tribute to Mitt Romney

  Mr. President, now, let's move slightly down from Montana to Utah, 
where the Senate is again losing an incredibly principled leader in 
Mitt Romney. In his 6 years in the Senate, when Mitt Romney gave his 
farewell speech, again, he acknowledged he is still just a freshman 
Senator.
  Mitt led with an unshakable, tireless adherence to his values. It is 
not too hard to stand up for what you know is right if you agree with 
the rest of your team. But if you are bucking your party--and I have 
done that more than once--it requires tremendous bravery and sometimes 
enduring a deeply loneliness and isolation.
  Even when it was hard, even when it was lonely, even when he endured 
harsh critique, Mitt never backed down from his principles--and I say 
this with deep admiration, even for the times when I disagreed with 
him. And there were many.
  We worked closely together on all of the bipartisan ``gangs''--the 
effort to bring about the final COVID package under then-President 
Trump, the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill, the notion of the 
Electoral Count Act. Time and again, Mitt was right there fighting for 
his values, but also realizing you have got to get to ``yes'' if you 
are actually going to make things happen.
  The infrastructure bill, in particular, is an incredible achievement 
that is going to bring millions of homes in Utah to the broadband they 
deserve, the kind of road, rail, and other services that are essential. 
And during every step of these negotiations, as I said before, Mitt 
never wavered from his strong conservative beliefs.
  He can read a balance sheet. He is part of a very small minority--I 
will include the Presiding Officer, probably less than double digits in 
this Senate--who can read a balance sheet. I count myself as one of 
those. He knows when numbers don't add up. And he will fight to make it 
right.

  Our Nation is stronger because of his smart, principled leadership. 
And, again, while I understand that he and Ann have got other things to 
do going forward, he will still be involved in our community. We are 
going to miss him here in the Senate.

                         Tribute to Jon Tester

  So let's take a quick trip across the country and start in Big Sky 
Country, in Montana, where my friend Jon Tester oftentimes started his 
day as early as 2:45 a.m., just to make sure he would be able to get 
back to DC in time for votes.
  Now, on many dark, freezing Montana mornings, he took an hours-long 
drive and then a plane and then another plane to get to the Senate to 
fight for Montanans and veterans across the country. Most times, it 
took 11 to 12 hours. And as the Presiding Officer knows, that was only 
the case when it wasn't snowing.
  But week in and week out, he did it, and he fought hard for Montanans 
in the Senate. And then reversed that same long commute at the end of 
the week to make it back to the farm with his wife Sharla.
  And amongst all of it, I am not sure if there is anyone else in this 
body who still is operating as a citizen legislator and literally 
having another full-time job trying to farm his ranch in Montana.
  I have been guilty, as I said the other day on the floor, of 
sometimes complaining about this job. I have to always take a deep 
breath and realize I am a guy who lives 20 minutes away and was lucky 
enough to come into the job with some financial resources--not totally 
dissimilar from the Presiding Officer.
  When I think, though, about sacrifice, when I think of people who are 
here for all the right reasons--no matter how hard it is, no matter how 
long it takes--I think, first and foremost of my friend Jon Tester.
  When I think of public servants--and I have had people ask me this, 
not dozens of times but hundreds of times: Whom do you most respect? 
How do you put up with this? All of the vagaries in this job--I always 
tell them the story about Jon Tester. He has done it. He is a man who 
has done it all to serve the people around him--a former band teacher; 
long before it was cool, an organic farmer; and an incredibly effective 
Senator. Jon has lived a life of service and devotion to the country, 
all while having fewer fingers than many of us.
  He helped us negotiate the infrastructure law. He single-handedly led 
the passage of the PACT Act, one of the most significant expansions of 
benefits to veterans ever. He did it all without complaint, without 
asking for much attention, and with enough time to travel home 12 hours 
at the end of the week, as I said, to be with family and continuing to 
produce food that feeds America.
  Jon is the consummate public servant. He is a phenomenal farmer and 
friend. And he will be deeply missed here in the Senate.
  I can't think of anyone--as we think about the political activities 
these days, we often talk about, you know, who is authentic or not, the 
most outrageous criticism of Jon Tester never included any sense that 
he wasn't a real Montanan, that he wasn't authentic. And he never 
strayed from what brought him here in the first place.

  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I actually rise to the floor to follow, I 
think, one of the Democratic leaders, my dear friend from Illinois, to 
probably make pretty similar comments about some of our retiring 
Members. And, you know, the work we do in this body sometimes is 
frustrating. Sometimes, it is inefficient. It is critically important.
  But one of the things that makes it worthwhile is the relationships 
and friendships that we develop with colleagues all across the 
political spectrum, from both sides of the aisle. And I am sure I am 
going to echo some of the comments that have already been made by the 
senior Senator from Illinois. So let me talk about some of these 
comments. I want to highlight their accomplishments one by one.

                       Tribute to Kyrsten Sinema

  Mr. President, I am going to go a little bit further south, to Mitt's 
southern neighbor, Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Senator Sinema is also 
departing the Senate after a storied 6 years.
  Kyrsten also worked together on all of these bipartisan efforts, 
particularly the infrastructure bill, where she and her friend Rob 
Portman were the leaders of our group and on so many other notable 
compromises--yes, compromises--over time in Washington. Kyrsten was a 
former social worker, an incredibly fast runner, and a tireless 
independent advocate for Arizonans. Senator Sinema always made a splash 
and often, at the end of the day, won her battles.
  But for all the ink spilled on Kyrsten, what I think a lot of people 
failed to see is her incredible ability to talk and build relationships 
with everyone. There have been so many times--not just on the big 
bills, candidly not just at the behest of Democratic leadership, but 
candidly on the behest of some of our Republican friends, to say this 
Senator is being particularly challenging on this bill or on this 
issue. I think there was probably no one who got sent into those kind 
of negotiations or ``Can you work to get this Senator or that Senator 
to release their hold?''

[[Page S6945]]

  She has worked with folks all across the political spectrum. And when 
talks broke down, as they often do in these negotiations, she had an 
incredible ability to keep reaching out and engaging with everyone and 
anyone. I will deeply miss her ability to reach across the aisle and 
get things done for Arizonans.

                        Tribute to Sherrod Brown

  Mr. President, I made a comment on this, this morning. It has been a 
tremendous privilege to serve on the Banking Committee with my friend 
Sherrod Brown from Ohio. In Sherrod's long career in the Senate, he 
remained unchanged. He fought for the dignity of workers. He fought 
against special interests that hurt Americans. He fought always for 
Ohio.
  Deeply smart and principled, Sherrod built an incredible record 
standing up for working families and leading the Banking Committee with 
strength and a vision for revitalizing the middle class.
  I particularly remember working with him back in 2016-2017 on a 
bitter fight to extend healthcare and pensions for thousands of 
miners--again, it is something I have talked about, we worked together 
with Joe Manchin--who were at risk of losing coverage. We had to 
threaten to block all bills being passed by unanimous consent to get it 
done. But we eventually secured a temporary fix and then a long-term 
one to protect the pensions and health insurance for American miners. 
Tens of thousands of miners secured lifetime coverage because of that 
bill.
  I was always glad to fight alongside Sherrod on our shared 
priorities. But in addition to standing up for miners, there are other 
things we had in common. Sherrod's incredible wife Connie is a 
phenomenal writer and speaker, whom he brought down to be honored at 
one of our women's conferences down in Norfolk. I had the unenviable 
task of following her on the speaking lineup.
  And let me tell you--and Sherrod probably knows--she is an impossible 
act to follow. She had a room of literally hundreds and hundreds of 
women of all races, ages, and background on their feet, literally 
hooting and hollering. And Sherrod, ever the supporter of Connie, was 
there to cheer her on. But then inspired by her performance, he brought 
that idea back to Ohio. And, I know, over the last 8 or 9 years, he has 
had his own women's conference.
  With events like that and a long record of legislative 
accomplishments, both in the Senate and the House, a whole lot of 
working folks, Sherrod's legacy of work for the middle class and 
Ohioans and Americans will be a real tribute to him.


                    Tribute to Robert P. Casey, Jr.

  Which brings me to Sherrod's neighbor, somebody who has worked on so 
many bipartisan deals as well, and that is Bob Casey.
  Mr. President, as the true embodiment and spirit of Pennsylvania, Bob 
Casey arrived every day in the Senate ready to fight for teachers, 
kids, workers, seniors. He led the charge in the Senate to cut junk 
fees and fought the greediness that emptied the pockets of Americans.
  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I have grown to know and 
see his steadfast work at protecting America's national security 
firsthand. Bob approached every hearing with a thoughtful and engaged 
perspective--never partisan or dominating or destructive. Bob Casey 
asked decisive questions, advanced important priorities, and took on 
the work of seriousness and dedication. Our committee was stronger for 
that.
  And, more than anything, Bob Casey will be remembered for being a 
fundamentally decent guy. He approached every problem and every 
interaction every day with kindness and respect for every person he 
encountered, not just other Senators but staffers, support personnel. 
And you don't see that from a whole lot of us.
  We will miss Bob greatly in the Senate, and I will miss him 
particularly on the Intelligence Committee. My only regret is we never 
got a chance to play basketball.
  So for those Senators and some others, I know my time is expiring. I 
will come back and speak about other friends like Ben Cardin and others 
who are leaving. The body will be lesser for that, but I am hopeful. 
This is a place where, after the elections, you can't bear grudges. You 
have got to go back and work with your new colleagues. I hope to 
develop the same kind of relationships as I have had with these 
Senators on both sides of the aisle. I respect them all. I will miss 
them, but those of us who remain need to continue and fight on.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.

                       Tribute to Joe Manchin III

  Mr. President, now, while we are on the topic of reaching across the 
aisle, I would be remiss if I didn't speak on the incredible career of 
my great friend Joe Manchin and maybe the only person I can say that I 
had a direct role in personally bringing to the Senate.
  Joe and Gayle and Lisa and I have been friends since we were 
Governors together. And I remember how when Senator Byrd had passed, to 
fill the vacancy and he thought about running, I encouraged him, like, 
come on up, Joe; we can get things done. And I knew, because of his 
incredible position of putting points on the board for West Virginians 
and his ability to stick to his guns, that he would get things done.
  And much like Mitt, Joe is also a tireless defender of what he 
believes in. Folks like to speculate how he would vote or what he would 
do. But I never thought it was all that hard to figure out what Joe 
Manchin was going to vote for or where he was going to come down. All 
you had to do was listen to what he said. And if he thought it was in 
the best interest of the folks in West Virginia, he would be for it, no 
matter how much grief he took. It was always as simple as that.
  You know, it was a bit of a common refrain in this town for a while, 
the joke was Joe was one of the most powerful people in America. You 
know, it worked as a joke because it actually had a lot of truth to it. 
Bill after bill, Joe got a lot done on the infrastructure law and all 
these bipartisan deals. I remember his relentless fight for making sure 
that America would stand up and keep the promise made by Harry Truman 
to our miners in terms of their pensions. I was very proud of being one 
of his wingmen on that.
  But what he is going to be, I think, at the end of the day, 
remembered for--and boy, did he get a lot of grief on this as well--was 
passing one of the most seismic energy laws in our country's history. 
Getting that bill done is not only about our energy in our country, but 
he literally helped move the rest of the world toward a cleaner, 
carbon-free environment.
  Yes, he believes that there is going to be a transition. Yes, he 
believes you can't get rid of some of our existing sources. But without 
the IRA, the fundamental movement that is already going to generate a 
trillion dollars of activity wouldn't have happened, the Inflation 
Reduction Act. And, boy, he paid a price for this, in making sure that 
America becomes energy independent and moves to be more carbon-free and 
at the same time also finally put in place an ability to start 
negotiating drug prices. That law would not be law without Joe Manchin.
  I believe it is a transformative, once-in-a-century piece of 
legislation. It is saving money for seniors in West Virginia and for 
seniors across the country, and it all was due to Joe Manchin. I could 
go bill after bill. And Lord knows, there have been times I have 
disagreed with him.
  And I hope, Joe Manchin, after all this, you will realize that, 
coming here to this Senate, you did make things happen; you got things 
done. And our country and West Virginia are better for it.

                        Disaster Relief Funding

  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am going to be brief because you don't 
want to stand in the way of the majority leader-elect.

[[Page S6946]]

  I come to the floor today because at 3 o'clock this afternoon in the 
house chamber in Raleigh, there is a veto-override. There was a veto by 
Governor Cooper for a disaster relief bill that the people of Western 
North Carolina need.
  Now, I understand there are provisions in there that have to do with 
a legitimate disagreement about the scope and the role of the executive 
branch, but this is not the time for us to rethink whether or not we 
should be sending every signal we can to the people of North Carolina 
that help is on the way.
  I am doing my part here in this Chamber to make sure that our Members 
stay focused on providing $100 billion in relief before we get out of 
this Congress. I need my colleagues in Raleigh to vote to override that 
veto today so that we can be sure that North Carolina knows that every 
Republican and every Democrat--we are not Republicans or Democrats; we 
are North Carolinians trying to provide desperate help to a land mass 
the size of Massachusetts that has experienced more than 100 deaths, 
thousands of businesses impacted, thousands of people out of their 
homes.
  So I just come to the floor today to encourage any member who may 
have one reason or another to not sustain this veto-override in the 
house chamber in Raleigh to set that aside today and go do right by the 
people of Western North Carolina.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.

                                Economy

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday, President Biden delivered a 
speech on the economy--a last attempt to rescue his dismal economic 
record. Incredibly, during the course of the speech, he repeated a 
phrase that he has often used about growing the economy from the bottom 
up and the middle out. I am not sure how that phrase continues to get 
past White House fact checkers because if there is one thing that 
President Biden has failed to do, it is to build an economy from the 
bottom up and the middle out.
  Thanks to President Biden's signature economic legacy--an inflation 
crisis of historic proportions--today, a typical family has to pay an 
additional $13,375 per year to maintain the same standard of living it 
enjoyed when the President took office--$13,375 per year, more than 
$1,000 per month. And who do you think that affects the most? Not 
billionaire Democrat donors or Hollywood stars. No. It affects the 
bottom and the middle the most--the people who don't have a spare 
$13,000 lying around and who have had to cut back on extras or, in many 
cases, essentials to survive in the Biden economy.
  CBS News exit polling in November found that two-thirds of voters 
described the economy as bad, and 45 percent said their financial 
situations were worse than they were 4 years ago. And it is no wonder. 
President Biden likes to talk about giving families breathing room, but 
his economy took away breathing room for a whole lot of Americans. 
Working Americans paying 22 percent more for groceries and 31 percent 
more for gas and 28 percent more for electricity and 23 percent more in 
rent than they were when President Biden took office are not seeing a 
lot of breathing room for their budgets.
  The President likes to pretend, as he did in his speech yesterday, 
that he came in and saved the economy after COVID, but the truth is, 
the economy was already well on its way to a healthy recovery, and his 
massive, ill-advised, supposed COVID relief legislation helped kick off 
an inflation crisis whose reverberations are still being felt today in 
family budgets around the country. President Biden can give all the 
speeches he wants touting his economic record, but his economy has been 
the very opposite of a boon to lower and middle-income families.
  The good news is that the days of President Biden's disastrous 
economic policies are numbered. In January, President Trump will take 
office, and Republicans will have control of the House and the Senate. 
Expanding economic opportunity and increasing growth and Americans' 
wages will be a top priority. That means taking action via 
reconciliation to preserve the tax relief that Republicans delivered 
during the first Trump administration--tax relief that improved take-
home pay for millions of hard-working Americans. It also means 
targeting onerous regulations choking our economy, like the thousand-
plus Biden-Harris regulations that have already cost Americans well 
over $1.5 trillion. It means things like unleashing American energy and 
restoring American energy dominance, which will benefit both the 
economy and our national security.
  President Biden's energy policies have jeopardized the future of our 
already shaky electric grid and set us up for future supply problems, 
but his war on American energy ends next month, and a better future is 
in sight. It won't take long now.
  I yield the floor.

          Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery

  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, we are running out of time. We have just 
over a week left before Congress goes home for the holidays, and we 
cannot leave town without passing long-term disaster relief.
  People have waited and waited and waited and waited for help to 
arrive, and every day that we don't get this done is another day that 
survivors can't start to get back to life as they knew it--going to 
work, going to school, dropping their kids off at basketball practice, 
getting together with friends and neighbors.
  For the people in Lahaina, help cannot come soon enough. Almost a 
year and a half after the tragic fires, it is as hard as ever to make 
ends meet. Housing is scarce. Prices are going up. Jobs are hard to 
come by. People are doing everything they can to get by and to help 
each other out. So it is not for a lack of trying; it is that they were 
never meant to confront this recovery alone.
  When you have lost everything, when you are still mourning friends 
and loved ones, when you are 16 months into a recovery and normalcy 
still feels so far away, you need help, and getting that help is the 
difference between people being able to stay on Maui or leaving. People 
are leaving the only place they have ever called home. Those are the 
stakes. They are not theoretical. This is happening to hundreds of 
families in West Maui.
  Lahaina is not the only community that has been devastated by a 
disaster. Communities in 40 States are building back from a disaster of 
some kind--a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane--and more than 25 States 
are relying on long-term Federal assistance to get survivors back on 
their feet. No one is asking for charity. What they are asking for is 
the kind of aid that has helped to restore so many communities across 
the country over many, many years. This is what Congress is supposed to 
do--Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, New York and New Jersey after 
Hurricane Sandy, Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, California after 
the 2018 wildfires, and more than a dozen States nationally as recently 
as 3 years ago.
  The Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program--
known as CDBG-DR--works. It has supported millions of Americans struck 
by disaster over the last 30 years by giving them flexible, long-term 
assistance. So to fail to do this now for people in Lahaina and across 
the country would be quite unusual and shameful.
  We have a simple task here: to help our fellow Americans in their 
hour of need. I want to be perfectly clear. We cannot and we will not 
leave town without passing disaster aid.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from Indiana.

                         Farewell to the Senate

  Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, it has been the honor of my lifetime to 
represent Hoosiers here in the U.S. Senate.
  When I said I was going to do this back in 2017--I didn't have much 
of a political legacy--to leave my business that I had spent 37 years 
running and that I wanted to run for the U.S. Senate, everybody said: a 
fool's errand--it couldn't be done.
  But there were a lot of Hoosiers wanting the system to be shaken up a 
little bit. When I interpreted, I think, what politics was doing back 
in 2015 and 2016, I crafted that unusual idea that it could be done 
even when you have made most of your life in the trenches in the real 
world.
  I was told when I got here: Freshman Senators are not to be heard, 
may be seen. Sit back; learn the ropes.
  Well, that wasn't going to work for me because I had already put 
myself into a corner because I said I wouldn't do it more than two 
terms. That is unusual. Everyone says it, they get amnesia, and then 
you know the rest of the story.
  I have been so proud of what we have done here in these 6 years, what 
we have done for Hoosiers. And when I tell you about some of the things 
that can be done, I think you are going to be amazed.
  I put together a staff that came here mostly from Indiana, and their 
goal was to get things done, to get it across the finish line. And, 
sure, I was proud to have been named the most effective first-term 
Republican Senator and the sixth most effective in our caucus, 
generally, in the last Congress, and probably close to that again in 
this one. But all of us here know that we get the credit for it and it 
is your staff that does all the heavy lifting.
  This 2021 freshman Senate office got more bills across the finish 
line than any other--it is amazing--and 37 in the span of 6 years. 
Again, that is why the Center for Effective Lawmaking singled out our 
office as being most impactful in areas like healthcare, education, and 
agriculture--all the stuff I bumped into in so many ways in the real 
world before I got here.
  I want to tell you about a few of those wins. Incoming Senators will 
hopefully get inspired by it.
  Imagine, as a Republican, when one of your biggest pieces of 
legislation has the word ``climate'' in it. So I will get to how that 
happened in the first place, but, being a conservationist, one who 
knows that is an issue that we, as Republicans and conservatives, have 
to be involved with, we actually crafted a bill called the Growing 
Climate Solutions Act, which was a landmark bill for farmers that 
matched up their good stewardship with offset markets that were already 
there but government was making it too difficult for them to take 
access of it, especially small farmers. Imagine it passing in the U.S. 
Senate 92 to 8. That is darn near a miracle.
  How did that happen in the first place? I was here maybe 6 or 7 
months, and Senator Chris Coons from Delaware had been trying to find 
one Republican to engage in the discussion, which we know how big a 
discussion that has been. Of course, we are always going to disagree on 
policy, but he had probably asked so many others over the last 2 years 
that he was going after a rookie Senator.
  He didn't realize that he ran into somebody that had to think on his 
feet a lot in the real world and made decisions fairly quickly based on 
what you really know. And I said: I will do it.
  I think the rest of the conversation was: Will it be more than a 
committee of two of us?
  Give me a month.
  I got six other Republicans. And it is still an issue of contention 
in terms of what it is about, where it is going. Some are absolutely 
certain about it; some have put no credence to it. Obviously, it is 
somewhere in between.
  That, to me, was the first moment, being here after just 6 months, 
that said: If you do certain things and think out of the box, you can 
get a lot done.
  And that has probably put me in front of more discussions now that 
energy is the biggest issue at the State level. Demand for it was flat 
up until 2 years ago. And now, in Indiana, one of the best places to 
have a business, all the data centers want to come there. And we only 
produce 20 gigawatts of electricity. Each one of them needs one 
gigawatt. And what is going to be the right mix between baseload, 
intermittent, green, traditional? I intend to have Indiana at the 
leading front of that discussion.
  Veterans--that is an issue in many different ways. Those who serve 
our country still have trouble getting basic benefits, especially as it 
relates here in the Federal Government, where most of them come from. 
They told us back home in Indiana that to get claims information 
through the mail or driving to a regional location was clumsy, even 
through the mail, and logistically impossible when you had to travel 
sometimes 2 hours to get a basic checkup. That was a real burden for 
disabled veterans.
  We wrote the Wounded Warrior Access Act to streamline the claims 
process with an online tool. It was signed into law last year.
  I came here most proud of fixing healthcare back in my own business 
in

[[Page S6948]]

2008--a small business for half of the time I was there, over 37 years, 
20 employees or so. By 2008, we had grown to 300 employees. You can't 
imagine how sick and tired I was of hearing how lucky I was it is only 
going up 5 to 10 percent this year.
  Well, after hearing that for about 9 years, I got involved in the HR 
meeting back in 2008. Here was the first question I asked of the 
insurance company, since we had hardly any claims: What profit margin 
did you make on our plan?
  I was thinking 10, 15 percent. They were honest: 25 percent.
  I turned to the agent: What was your commission?
  Seven percent.
  We were stroking a million-dollar check back then. Do the math. That 
wasn't going to work for me.
  I said: What can we do to fix it?
  They said: Well, you could maybe self-insure.
  I said: You didn't tell us that last year.
  And I did that and self-insured and made it a cost center. But then 
the critical question was--and we need to all start asking these kinds 
of questions: How do you really lower costs and make Hoosiers and 
Americans healthier?
  They said: We have got a broken system. It is built upon expensive 
remediation.
  It sounded a little abstract. So I said: Let's flesh that out a 
little bit.
  Well, you have got your deductible. I had to raise that each year to 
moderate the increases, change underwriters every 3 years. That was a 
pain in the rear.
  So they said: If you really push wellness and prevention, it will be 
the start of how you lower healthcare costs.
  And then they said something that really surprised me: Healthcare 
consumers are nonexistent because they aren't involved in actually 
shopping around for healthcare. You depend on the insurance company in 
your company or the government to do it. That is the driver in most 
markets.
  I ended up, after that meeting, throwing every wellness tool and the 
kitchen sink at it, turned my employees into healthcare consumers, cut 
costs by over 50 percent, and haven't had an increase in 16 years.
  I always ask the question: Raise your hand if that has been the case.
  No one does. Those are the kinds of things we are going to have to do 
here and back home in the States.
  Here, being on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I told the 
chair of that committee, Senator Sanders: If you want to lower 
healthcare costs, start incentivizing the industry to be competitive 
and transparent.
  Well, that ended up creating what would be the most transformational 
bill, called the Health Care PRICE Transparency Act. And when you are 
getting someone like Senator Bernie Sanders and Mike Braun, the two 
loudest voices in the Senate, on healthcare reform, that is a modern 
miracle. And that bill is there as a template, already strongly 
bipartisan. Some of the features of it could be dropped into reforms 
that we do even this year.
  During the pandemic, Josh Hawley and I passed through a bill that 
would declassify all intelligence about the Wuhan lab and also prompted 
the President to direct the intelligence community to investigate the 
lab leak. As a result of that investigation, the FBI confirmed that 
they found a lab leak to be the most likely theory of origin.
  And when the current administration announced the vaccine mandate for 
businesses that would have vaccinated every employee in all businesses 
if you had 100 or more employees, after it was in the rearview mirror, 
we dusted off an old law called the Congressional Review Act that 
hadn't been used in years, and we used that and got bipartisan support 
on it. And then, lo and behold, when the Supreme Court struck down the 
vaccine mandate, they cited our challenge as the most significant 
action in Congress that had weighed in on the mandate. You can get 
results if you stick your neck out, take a little risk.

  Before I go to the other side of being a Senator--what you do back 
home called ``constituent services''--I want to talk about a few of the 
lighter moments of being in the U.S. Senate.
  I will never forget when I got here--and we have great lunches; kudos 
to the staff that prepares them. And it said lunchtime starts at 12:30; 
it is over at 2. Well, that seemed like a lot of time. I show up at 
12:30. Even the staff wasn't fully--had the meal there ready to go. I 
said: What is going on? They said: Well, 12:30 is the official time. No 
one shows up until after 1. So there is Senate time and real time. You 
have to get adjusted to that.
  The pace is maybe a little different when you come from the field of 
being a scrappy entrepreneur. The only other Senator that did the same 
thing was, of course, a guy named Rick Scott who ran a business, ran 
the State of Florida. We didn't make that mistake another time.
  I was able to host a lunch. I am in the logistics business. You have 
to come up with something that is unique to your community. We are 
probably the most German Catholic community in the State of Indiana, so 
we wanted to have schnitzel and brats. Well, the plan was to drive them 
from Indiana to DC. I actually had a volunteer do that because, believe 
it or not, that was the only way that was practical and least expensive 
to host a lunch.
  Here is one of the most unusual moments. We all get involved in 
media--probably far too much of it. But part of this job is having the 
pulpit to say what you believe, what you want to weigh in on.
  I was actually doing an interview in the middle of COVID. I can't 
remember which network. But all of a sudden, a minute into about a 7-
minute interview, the cameraman goes down, literally. I thought the 
camera or the light stand was coming at me. The interview continued. My 
wife was watching it at home and thought we had a mini earthquake here. 
So I remember one of the other cameramen said: I have never seen 
anything like that in the U.S. Senate.
  The story wasn't over. About a minute before the interview was over, 
he starts to dust himself off. He had been out for 4 minutes. He grabs 
the camera stand or light, and I thought, This time, it is coming at 
me. I didn't know what I was going to do; although, he went down again, 
and we completed the interview. Of course, I was worried about what 
happened. An ambulance came. We were lucky in that case. It was 
dehydration.
  Imagine being in a pickle like that. We got through it.
  Other memories, after the first State of the Union Address, I was 
walking back. I live right east of the Supreme Court building. It was a 
starlit evening. The moon silhouetted the Capitol. I said to myself: 
How can you be so lucky?
  Now, the other side of being a Senator is constituent services. 
Customer service was always my priority in my business. Believe me, you 
don't have to pay consultants for them to tell you what is wrong with 
your business. Just listen to your employees and to your customers--
free advice. It doesn't cost a penny. If you get it fixed, you actually 
corrected an issue you have with your company.
  So I told them I wanted to run constituent services back home, just 
like customer service in my business. We put together a team just as 
good there--when you listen to these stats--as the one that enabled me 
to do so much here on the legislative side--they closed 13,775 
constituent cases in 6 years, assisting Hoosiers with problems that 
were really impacting their lives. There are many ways you can get 
entangled with the Federal Government.
  My team returned $21.6 million that were owed to Hoosiers back to 
them, mostly from the IRS. That money had an immediate impact. One 
woman in Columbus was at risk of losing her home, and we were able to 
recover $10,000 that, again, was owed to her by the IRS.
  My team handled 2,381,813 emails, phone calls. Believe me, there are 
a lot of ways, if people just do it, to get a hold of who represents 
you here in DC. But then what do you do with it? We put a metric in 
that if those weren't handled within a certain number of days, it set 
off an alarm. Unbelievable constituent services--1,500 hours of mobile 
office hours. When they reached out, we found the solutions.
  One Hoosier's family reached out because their mother's ashes were 
lost at

[[Page S6949]]

a post office facility, couldn't be located. We secured an inspector 
general audit of the post office to make sure that never happens again.
  A family of an Indiana soldier killed in Vietnam didn't get the 
Silver Star. It had been a long time. We recovered that for them. My 
team cut through the redtape and delivered that medal to his family. It 
had been 50 years they were trying.
  As proud as I am of the legislation passed and the constituent 
services that we gave, I am also proud of sounding the alarm for what I 
think is our biggest issue impacting our country. To be honest, it has 
been like talking to the side of my barn back home. I learned what it 
was about to make ends meet because your tail was on the line running a 
small business.
  I am optimistic since we do so many great things in this country. But 
the incentives have been so strong to go the opposite way that, 
hopefully, we can change the direction that, in my mind, will bankrupt 
the country, and it has been from both sides of the aisle. It has been 
where we just expected too much out of this place. We need to focus on 
doing a few things better.
  To show you the magnitude, 6 years ago, we were $18 trillion in debt. 
In 6 years, we have doubled it. We borrow $1 trillion every 6 months, 
and that is the interest that we pay on our debt now every 6 months, as 
well. We actually borrow $2 trillion a year.
  This spending spree has had a real effect on the American people. We 
have inflation, rising interest rates, and a projected debt that is 
going to be $56 trillion in 10 years. If you are good at math, that 
gets geometrically more difficult to get out of that hole being dug 
that deep.

  I had a business, the first 17 years where the office was in a mobile 
home. I got introduced out here: Had his office in a double-wide. I 
said, it was a used single-wide. That was my first and only opportunity 
of doing what I wanted to do.
  Well, the overhead was so low, you almost had to stoop to get in the 
door, figuratively speaking, but I learned a lot of valuable lessons. 
In the real world, you have to live within your means. Borrowing money 
from our kids and grandkids is not a business plan that is going to 
work.
  How do we turn things around? The best thing, we are not flying blind 
here. There is an instruction manual called the Constitution, 
especially the 10th Amendment. As the Federal Government has struggled, 
the States have been a laboratory for how you fix things. That is where 
the innovation is going to come from in the next decade.
  I am so excited to lead that charge back home in Indiana. It was so 
hard to get here in the first place. The question I get asked most: Why 
wouldn't you stay? I kind of explained that a little bit earlier that I 
believe in term limits. It was an either-or choice--either run for 
Governor or serve another term here. I am not going to lose sight of 
what I have been a part of, but I do feel I made the right choice.
  On this entire journey, I couldn't have done it without my life 
partner Maureen, married 48 years ago. I never get that number wrong, 
even if it is off by a year. On our wedding, I will never forget 
everyone as they passed me and got to her. I was trying to listen if 
anyone said that she was lucky because I was first and everyone, 
without exception, said how lucky I was. Well, I just couldn't resist; 
after we got out of the line there at the church--maybe later that 
evening--I said, ``Dear, were there any people that told you, you were 
lucky?'' And in a very diplomatic way, she said: ``There were a few.''
  I have been blessed beyond all measure there. I have a family that 
has been great. Three of the four kids work and run the business I ran 
for 37 years. Three of my seven grandkids are right up there--Michael, 
Kate, and Julia; and Jason, one of my four kids. I have been blessed 
beyond measure when you look at all of that.
  And then the thing I talk most often about is faith, family, and 
community--in that broader scope, how we were so lucky to be dropped 
into the place called Jasper, IN. That, to me, is something I will 
never figure out.
  I am just thankful that when I ended up having one of the best MBAs 
in the country and was headed to Wall Street, we talked about, do we 
want to do it when we wanted to raise a family? I took the first 
entrepreneur's course there. She already wanted her own business. It 
didn't seem like Wall Street was going to work out.
  Well, we moved back home. Best job I could find was over an 80-
percent pay cut. If we hadn't done that, it is almost certain I 
wouldn't be here this afternoon doing a farewell speech in the U.S. 
Senate.
  I tour all 92 counties each year. I have offered open office hours, 
scheduling into it on Fridays. Hoosiers, I will be doing that as your 
next Governor as well.
  Hoosiers are some of the most good-hearted, hard-working people in 
the world. It has been my honor to serve you here.
  To all my colleagues here in the Senate, thank you for your 
friendship and the honor of serving alongside you in this esteemed 
body, not to mention all the precious memories I will take back to 
Indiana.
  I will part on this, because I spent so much time sitting in that 
seat as the Presiding Officer at the most inconvenient time each week, 
Thursday afternoon from 3 to 6. Well, you are pretty well the lone 
soldier by then. You are going to get in the wrap-up. Rick Scott was 
the only one who had poorer seniority than me. I will never forget. We 
were all interested in wrapping it up.
  Well, the first thing I did was figured out a way to where I only had 
to do it every other week. It took a little risk. It paid off, so I 
didn't have to do it every week. Then I found there were some Senators 
who liked to linger around a little later on Thursdays than maybe what 
they needed to. And there was one who did it every Thursday and had 
flexibility--my friend, Senator Dan Sullivan. You need to tune in 
because he does the Alaskan of the Week.
  All I said was: Dan, could you move it up about an hour and a half? 
And he did, and that enabled me to get home late on a Thursday instead 
of a Friday. I was even doing some entrepreneurial work right there. 
You can ask anybody in the well now, we were all wanting to see that 
happen together.
  Finally, I tried to bust the dress code here by not wearing a tie. 
There was a time or two where I barged in here without one and almost 
got tackled by Senator Lankford once, but I got in and out. But that is 
one thing I am not going to change. I keep a tie in the Cloakroom. 
Thank you, again, for keeping me dressed correctly when I need to be on 
the floor on occasions like this.
  It has been quite a run; it will be bittersweet to leave the place; 
and thank you all for the enjoyment I have had here.
  I yield the floor.
  (Applause, Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.
  Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I wanted to address Senator Braun's 
family, members of his staff, and others who may be watching these 
proceedings today. Congratulations to Senator Braun for a great run 
here. To his family, just wonderful people, I see Maureen in the 
Gallery and other members of the family. I know they are incredibly 
proud of Mike at this moment, and they are looking forward to the next 
step in his professional journey and, therefore, their journey, so 
thank you for your service.
  I know that this is every bit as much of a sacrifice and a period of 
service for members of one's family as it is for us. Sometimes, it is 
more challenging for family members because we lose all control over 
what people are saying and whatnot but great to visit with you, and I 
am looking forward to this next step.
  And then members of the team, I think it was right and appropriate 
that Senator Braun spent so much time talking about your great work on 
behalf of the people of Indiana.
  The bills that he has shown leadership on, multiple bills, and 
successes would not have happened, as he said, but for your work, the 
phone calls received, and the emails responded to, all the meetings. I 
mean, it is really important. Many people call their U.S. Senator only 
once. Most people don't call, but they will talk to someone who has 
talked to a U.S. Senator, and those interactions are just so essential.
  They shape people's views of what government can be, and they help 
people be reassured during times like these that they are represented. 
And so

[[Page S6950]]

I appreciate you very much. For many of you, I know you will return to 
the great Hoosier State and keep working in some sort of service 
capacity, and I will look forward to working together.
  Mike, I have to say, the Senate's loss is Indiana's gain. You have 
certainly served with distinction here, but I know you have always 
prided yourself, appropriately so, on your executive responsibilities 
and achievements over the years. Now, the people of Indiana will 
benefit from a different type of service, and we are all very much 
looking forward to seeing what is next. It has already started, I know.
  I have to say, the hunting is better. The hunting is a heck of a lot 
better, whether you are a hunter hunting things with faces or 
mushrooms, and there is no better place to do that kind of thing than 
southern Indiana, Dubois County, preferably.
  You know, this is Indiana's win, this moment right here--remembering 
the great service and achievements--but when you reflect on the 
experience you bring to this next step, building and running a large 
organization, and yet you still have exposure to and experience in 
government between the local school board levels, State legislature for 
a brief period of time, and then the U.S. Senate, what better 
perspective could an incoming chief executive of a State have?
  So I am really excited about this step. Your commitment, I know, will 
be enduring to fiscal responsibility and economic freedom. Those have 
been hallmarks of your service here. They are, frankly, expectations 
that people have of you and of our State. Carrying on that tradition of 
fiscal responsibility and effective management is, I think, one of the 
reasons you were elected, despite some strong and talented opponents 
you faced in that recent election.
  So here we are. Here we are parting ways in the U.S. Senate. But as 
we leave this Chamber, I will have an opportunity to call you Governor-
elect, and then we can keep working together on veterans' issues, on 
budgetary issues, on expanding healthcare access to more people, on 
ensuring that Hoosiers and others across the country have access to 
affordable, quality housing near where the jobs are. All of these 
issues that make normal life possible in this country. Government can 
be maddening; government can be inefficient; government can be 
unresponsive; but government is necessary. And if it is necessary, 
let's make it good government. Let's do what we can to instill some 
measure of confidence in this system, as imperfect as it may be.
  I think that this is something in this new capacity that you can help 
deliver at a time when so many people are pessimistic about the state 
of affairs. Again, you are the guy to make this happen.
  So Godspeed, Senator Braun. Godspeed to members of your team and to 
your beautiful family. I am looking forward to helping make you 
successful in this next step because if you are successful, Senator, 
then the State of Indiana is successful.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.

                         Birthright Citizenship

  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a fundamental 
question: Who is a citizen of the United States?
  My comments are inspired by an interview given recently by the 
President-elect in which he announced that he would try to end 
birthright citizenship on day one of his Presidency.
  In the same interview, he claimed that the United States was the only 
nation on Earth offering birthright citizenship. What is birthright 
citizenship? Is the United States the only nation that has it?
  Let's start with the Constitution. The 14th Amendment enacted by 
Congress in 1866 and ratified by the States in 1868 contains a clear 
definition of citizen.
  Section 1 states:

       All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and 
     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the 
     United States and of the State wherein they reside.

  A very straightforward definition. If you are born in the United 
States or naturalized by law--and that is covered in article I of the 
Constitution that Congress may set up a process for naturalizing--you 
are a U.S. citizen so long as you are subject to the jurisdiction of 
this country. And there is no equivocation, ``all persons'' in either 
category are U.S. citizens.
  The Constitution was first adopted, as we all know, in 1787. Why was 
this definition of citizen added to the Constitution in 1868--90 years 
later?
  Surprisingly, there was no definition of citizen in the Constitution 
as originally issued. The word ``citizen'' was used once without 
definition. Article II defines the qualifications to be President as 
follows:

       No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of 
     the United States . . . shall be eligible to the Office of 
     President.

  But the word ``citizen'' was not defined. The records of the 
Constitutional Convention show that the Framers considered defining the 
term ``citizen,'' but they had disagreements. And they couldn't reach a 
definition that satisfied them, and so they left the term ``citizen'' 
undefined in the Constitution as originally promulgated.
  This definition was added in the 14th Amendment in 1868 to fix a 
problem, a grievous problem: America's embrace of slavery.
  Dred Scott was born enslaved in Virginia in 1799. His parents were 
also enslaved, and his family had likely resided in this country for 
generations. Scott's owner took him first to Alabama and then to St. 
Louis and finally sold him to Army surgeon John Emerson when he was 
about 31 years old in 1830.
  Dr. Emerson then took Dred Scott first to Illinois, a free State, and 
then to the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was prohibited. Dred 
Scott worked as an enslaved laborer for the Emerson family for 16 years 
after they had purchased him. And he had attempted, over the course of 
those years, to purchase his own freedom and also the freedom of his 
wife Harriet. But the Emerson family refused to allow him to purchase 
his own freedom.
  So he eventually filed a freedom suit in St. Louis, seeking to be 
released from slavery on the grounds that when he resided in Illinois, 
a free State, and then in the Wisconsin Territory, a free territory, 
that residence extinguished his slavery and rendered him a freedman.
  The trial court in St. Louis ruled in his favor, granting him his 
freedom. But the Missouri Supreme Court reversed the decision. The 
matter was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court: Was Dred Scott free 
or enslaved?
  The U.S. Supreme Court rendered one of its most notorious decisions, 
Dred Scott v. Sandford, in 1857. Under the guidance of Chief Justice 
Roger Taney, the Court didn't simply confront the lower court issue, 
whether an enslaved person traveling to a free State or territory 
thereby gains freedom; instead the Court went much further, finding 
that no person of African descent, free or enslaved, no matter how long 
they or their family had lived here, could ever be considered a citizen 
of the United States.
  And without being a citizen, Dred Scott did not even have the right 
to seek relief in an American court. The heart of the Dred Scott 
opinion is very, very chilling. Justice Taney, in writing about African 
descendants living in the United States, said this:

       We think . . . that they are not included, and were not 
     intended to be included, under the word ``citizens'' in the 
     Constitution, and can therefore claim none [none] of the 
     rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and 
     secures to citizens of the United States.

  Even though the Constitution contained no definition of citizen, the 
Court declared broadly that no one of African descent could ever--could 
ever--attain that status.
  The Dred Scott v. Sandford decision was immensely controversial. It 
went far beyond Dred Scott's situation and held that all 4 million 
enslaved Black Americans in 1857, as well as hundreds of thousands of 
free men and women, were not and could not nor ever be citizens of the 
only country they had ever known.
  Two of the Justices of the Court dissented from the ruling, and one 
resigned partially to protest it. The backlash over Dred Scott v. 
Sandford was so severe that it became one of the precipitating causes 
of the Civil War a few years later.
  As the Civil War came to a close, with hundreds of thousands dead, 
with

[[Page S6951]]

much of the South in ruins, with President Lincoln assassinated, and 
with slavery abolished by the 13th Amendment, the reunited Nation 
realized it needed to fix the damage done by the Dred Scott case, and 
to do so, it needed to finally add a definition of citizen to the 
American Constitution. And that is what Congress and the States did in 
adopting section 1 of the 14th Amendment.
  All persons--all persons--either born in the United States or 
naturalized by law are citizens so long as they are subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction.
  This sentence, this one sentence, turned the formerly enslaved and 
all free African-Americans born here into citizens.
  The 13th Amendment rendered them not slaves, and yet they were not 
yet citizens so long as Dred Scott was the law of the land. This 
sentence was what turned liberated slaves and free African-Americans 
into U.S. citizens: If you are born in America, citizenship is your 
birthright.
  In the 1890s, the notion of birthright citizenship was tested in the 
Supreme Court. A man by the name of Wong Kim Ark was born in San 
Francisco to Chinese parents who were not U.S. citizens. He traveled to 
China, and then, in traveling back to the United States, his birthplace 
and home, he was denied reentry into this country based on the Chinese 
Exclusion Act, an egregious law of the time attempting to bar Chinese 
immigration. He sued to overturn the congressional ban, and the Court 
ruled in 1898 that he was a U.S. citizen based on the plain language of 
the 14th Amendment, and the Chinese Exclusion Act could therefore not 
apply to bar him entry into this country.
  Lawyers in the case attempted to argue, as some do today, that Wong 
Kim Ark, although born in the United States, was not subject to the 
jurisdiction of this country, but the Court dispatched this argument 
quickly by finding that Wong Kim Ark was clearly subject to the laws of 
the land of his birth.
  This ruling from 1898 has been the clear understanding of American 
law ever since. Birthright citizenship means that you are a U.S. 
citizen if you are born in America. Your right to citizenship does not 
depend upon the status of your parents. Dred Scott, Wong Kim Ark, and 
Donald Trump all meet that test.
  This birthright was only guaranteed following incalculable bloodshed, 
the centuries-long depravity of slavery, and the mass slaughter of the 
Civil War. The citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment was meant as an 
atonement for and a repair of that suffering.
  Anyone who wants to reverse or curtail birthright citizenship is 
acting directly contrary to the plain meaning of the Constitution, and 
they are attempting to move the United States back to a pre-Civil War 
mentality where certain kinds of people, although born in and long 
residing in the United States, are viewed as subordinate and unequal 
because of their parents' status or their ancestry.
  One additional point is important: The President-elect's claim that 
only the United States recognizes birthright citizenship. This 
statement is either ignorant or willfully deceptive. Thirty-three 
nations--many in the Americas, including Canada and Mexico--grant full 
birthright citizenship to all born within their borders. The United 
States is not alone in embracing birthright citizenship. In fact, I 
would argue that the United States has been the leader of a global 
movement to embrace birthright citizenship.
  I have described the painful history of how America reached the 
conclusion that all born here are entitled to citizenship so long as 
they are subject to the jurisdiction of this country. In future weeks, 
I will return to the Senate floor to describe the many benefits that 
birthright citizenship has bestowed on our Nation, and I will do so by 
telling the stories of Americans born to immigrant parents, whose 
contributions have enriched this country and even enriched the place we 
stand today--the U.S. Senate.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Florida.

                         Tribute to Mike Braun

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, it is my distinct opportunity 
to talk about my good friend Senator Mike Braun from Indiana.
  Senator Braun and I came up here at the exact same time. He was 99th 
in seniority and I was 100th in seniority 6 years ago. We both have 
very similar backgrounds. Both of us had built businesses. Both of us 
have very similar backgrounds in how we got started. Neither of us 
started with any money. We got to build successful businesses. We had 
to figure out how to control our costs because, you know, you are not 
going to succeed if you don't figure out how to control your costs. He 
had a very similar experience as I did on how you control healthcare 
costs: You make your employees consumers of healthcare. You make them 
be the ones that make the decision on how they are going to spend 
healthcare dollars.
  He also is very focused on the problems of Federal debt, the problems 
of Federal spending. From the time he got up here, he was a champion of 
fiscal sanity.
  With our wives, we had the opportunity to travel to Israel--I think 
our first summer here; I think it was our first summer--and spend a 
week there just learning everything we could about Israel. Senator 
Braun has a wonderful family, a wonderful wife--also an entrepreneur 
like he is. So I am going to miss him a lot.
  He talked about the fact that we were so naive when we first came up 
here. They were supposed to have lunch from 12:30 to 2 o'clock, and the 
business guys would show up on time, and there were only two of us 
there. The food wasn't out. So we were told that it doesn't really--
they say it starts on time, but it never did.
  We both saw the difficulty in trying to get things accomplished here 
and the difficulty in trying to control spending here. But his voice 
has been very important on the fight for fiscal sanity here, and his 
voice has been very important on the ability to try to figure out how 
we get our healthcare costs in line so people can afford it--not just 
government affording it but individuals can afford it.
  So I am going to miss him. We both have--we had the worst times 
together. I think he had the 3 to 6 and I had the 6 to whenever we 
finished on Thursday. Every Thursday, we were here. So he was very--he 
was smart. He put it together so that at least every Thursday, one of 
us could go home a little bit earlier, which was smart.
  He did talk to Dan Sullivan, who does a great job with--if you 
haven't had the opportunity to listen to Dan's Alaskan of the Week, 
talking about an Alaskan, he does a great job with that. He got him to 
move it up so we could get out of here earlier.
  He is just a great person. We served on the Aging Committee together 
and the Budget Committee. He is just a wonderful person to serve with.
  He is going to love being Governor. I had the opportunity to be 
Governor from 2011 to 2019. It is a great job. If you care about 
families, if you want to help people get a job, if you want to help 
people get a better education, if you want to keep people safe, that is 
exactly what you get to do.
  I think Senator Braun is going to be the best Governor in the country 
soon. He is going to make sure that Indiana is a State where people can 
get a great-paying job, their kids get a great education, and people 
feel safe. It is still a little cold for me. Florida is a little bit 
warmer than Indiana.
  I just want to say I am very appreciative of Mike's friendship. I am 
very appreciative of his hard work. I appreciate his tenacity.
  I can tell you that they are always going to live within their means 
because Mike will not waste a dime. Indiana will have probably the best 
budget in the country, and all their debt, if they have any, will be 
paid off quickly.
  I just wanted to say to Mike, thank you for your friendship. I look 
forward to working with you, and I am going to miss you up here.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I just wanted to note first that I 
really appreciate Senator Mike Braun's support on our effort to protect 
American's privacy and take on the rapid expansion of TSA use of facial 
surveillance. Stopping the establishment of a national surveillance 
system is very important to freedom and privacy in America, and I much 
appreciate his partnership in undertaking this topic

[[Page S6952]]

and wish him all the best in his return to be Governor of Indiana.

                   STOP INSTITUTIONAL CHILD ABUSE ACT

  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to say a few words about S. 1351 
and ask for its passage, as amended. But before I formally ask, I just 
want to know what this is all about; and that is, across our country, 
there are institutions that say they will help with your troubled teen. 
In fact, this has been become known as the troubled teen industry.
  Now, some of these institutions are long established, huge amounts of 
oversight, the best practices and the best results, and we certainly 
need these types of places to assist families when they are challenged 
in the family setting by the difficulties experienced by their 
children. But we also have a whole series of companies that have sprung 
up, whether for-profit or nonprofit, without the expertise, and saw an 
opportunity to make a lot of money and jump into a space without the 
proper foundation for actually being beneficial to teens. We had an 
experience with one of our Oregon children who died at just such a 
facility.
  One of the individuals--really the individual who proceeded to draw 
attention to this largely unregulated troubled teen industry is Paris 
Hilton. Paris wrote a memoir, and she shared in it, as summarized by, 
well, the summary of her book, that her childhood was shattered by 2 
years of strip searches, isolation, beatings, restraints, and 
brainwashing in this troubled teen institution. Her story is not alone. 
There are multiple stories of broken bones, of sexual assaults, of 
solitary confinement, even stories, as with our child in Oregon, of 
them dying in these institutions.
  We found that there really is a lack of detailed information about 
what is going on across America, so 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans 
have come together to sponsor this bill to say: We need to understand 
and therefore have recommendations on how to avoid the horrendous 
outcomes at some of the institutions. So this bill calls for just such 
a study.
  This bill proceeds to say: We want our kids safe. We want our kids 
respected. We want our children to have the very best care.
  I am struck by the tragedy that occurs when parents searching for 
help for their children strive to send them to a safe place and end up 
sending them to a very dangerous place. This is unacceptable.
  This bill says: Let's get a complete map of these institutions. Let's 
understand where they are and what they look like and what they cost 
and how long kids are staying there and how children are treated, how 
they are treated in ways that are inappropriate, and how, in some 
institutions, the gold-star institutions, how their best practices 
should be shared across the Nation, and how we should inform decision 
makers and policymakers across the country with the findings.
  So that is the simple story of this bill, and I am pleased that I am 
able to come to the floor now with a lot of support: Senator John 
Cornyn, a lead on the Republican side, and a lot of help from Tommy 
Tuberville. Senator Cassidy, who is ranking member of HELP, was 
involved in helping this bill go forward.
  I am thankful for the information we received from the Florida 
Sheriffs Youth Ranches, an institution that is highly respected and 
that has been in operation since 1957, providing support and help to 
literally thousands of young boys. Actually, that is the type of 
information we want collected--institutions that are working well, that 
have those best practices.
  So, Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be 
discharged from further consideration of S. 1351 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1351) to study and prevent child abuse in youth 
     residential programs, and for other purposes.

  There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the 
Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Merkley-Cornyn substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the 
bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The amendment (No. 3316), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed 
to.
  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of 
Amendments.'')
  The bill (S. 1351), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a 
third reading, was read the third time, and passed.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I failed to mention my appreciation for 
the conversations I have had with Senator Rick Scott, who helped 
facilitate dialogue with the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches and their 
contributions to how we should go forward.
  With that, I am really excited that we are getting this bill done. 
Thank you. Hopefully, the House will be able to expedite it, and we 
will start to understand an industry that we need to understand and 
America needs to understand so children are helped, not hurt.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                       Electric Vehicle Subsidies

  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the new Senate Republican majority 
begins on January 3, 2025. So our day one starts in 3 weeks. 
Republicans are going to enter the next Congress with a long ``fix it'' 
list on behalf of the American people. And at the top of the list is an 
agenda to lower costs and to restore American energy dominance.
  Prices today, we know, are 20 percent higher than they were 4 years 
ago, and, just this morning, we learned, once again, that prices have 
gone up in November. And we know the culprits, the problem behind the 
high prices: wasteful Washington spending. And we have seen a lot of it 
the last 4 years. The other reason, of course, is the Democrats 
throttling American energy production.
  Republicans are going to fix the fiscal insanity of the last 4 years. 
We will put Americans--not Washington bureaucrats--back into the 
driver's seat.
  We are going to start by repealing the Biden car bribe. This is 
something that President Trump strongly supports, and he is supporting 
what we are promoting. He has asked for it. He has campaigned on it. 
Eliminating this car bribe by the Biden administration--it is one of 
the most wasteful policies we have seen from this administration over 
the last 4 years. It is the Democrats' $7,500 subsidy for people buying 
electric vehicles. It was included in their reckless tax-and-spend 
legislation. It received zero--zero--Republican votes, not a one.
  It is an attempt by the Democrats to bribe the American people to go 
along with their unpopular climate fantasy. It is a welfare check for 
wealthy elites and for green corporations. It is a giveaway to 
communist China, which controls key parts of the EV supply chain.
  We were initially told by the Joint Committee on Taxation that these 
subsidies would cost about $14 billion. Well, the pricetag has 
continued to tick up since then. Today, there have been some revised 
estimates, and they have ballooned to projected costs of way over $300 
billion. That is right, over $300 billion. And that is for vehicles 
that most Americans don't want, can't afford, and don't work for them 
or their families.
  The auto dealers in Wyoming tell me it takes much, much longer to try 
to sell these things compared to the traditional gas-powered vehicles. 
They say they can't even sell them at a loss, and they are stockpiling 
them on the lots.
  Less than 10 percent of the new car sales in America last year were 
EVs. The sale figures have been abysmal. EVs lost market share. It is 
hard to believe. They actually lost market share in 2024.
  So you have these carmakers from around the country who are 
hemorrhaging cash. They are losing tons of money. And we have 
autoworkers who have lost their jobs.

[[Page S6953]]

  The CEO of Ford says his company is projected to lose $5 billion this 
year on their EV market. Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, is also in 
the ditch. In August, it announced plans to lay off thousands of 
autoworkers at its plants in Michigan. Yet, last week, it won a $7.54 
billion loan--a loan, an additional loan--from the Biden 
administration, over $7.5 billion for something that is failing.
  Joe Biden is leaving the White House the same way he led it: by 
doubling down on failure.
  America now has fewer manufacturing jobs today than it did last year. 
And do you want to know the dirtiest secret of Democrats in terms of 
the Biden car bribe? It sends taxpayer money to communist China. But 
the original law was clear. It said, if your EV was made with Chinese 
batteries or used their critical minerals, it would then be 
ineligible--not eligible--for taxpayer-funded subsidies. Chinese 
batteries, Chinese components can't get any of the subsidy benefits.
  Senator Manchin actually wrote that provision into that bill. 
Republicans still voted against the entire bill. We thought it was a 
waste of taxpayer dollars. Joe Biden signed it, and then EV sales 
stalled out.
  So what did the Democrats do? They double-dealed. They could have 
made it easier to mine more critical minerals in America, to use our 
own supply chain. But, no, President Biden decided to overrule the 
China ban.
  The Department of the Treasury came out with lax rules on sourcing 
materials, meaning that communist China will benefit from American tax 
dollars. It also means that American workers will pay a higher price 
for a policy and for vehicles they don't want.
  We need to go back to a consumer-driven, free-enterprise system. This 
is the United States of America. We should never be dependent on 
dictators and despots, like those that we have in communist China.
  Electric vehicles make sense for some people, but they are not an 
option for all people. Consumers have legitimate anxiety about the 
range of these vehicles, about costly repairs, and about extremely 
expensive insurance, because, often, a minor ding on one of these 
electric vehicles, with damage done, well, they call it a total and 
complete loss of the vehicle, not something that can be repaired. That 
is why the insurance is much higher on electric vehicle than 
traditional vehicles.
  And, frankly, if EVs were better options, then government wouldn't 
need to bribe Americans all across the country to buy them or to bribe 
businesses to build them.
  Electric vehicles are a luxury item. They are toys with severe 
limitations. They are not must-have means of transportation. Taxpayers 
shouldn't be forced to pay for the cost of luxury vehicles. It is wrong 
for taxpayers, tax dollars, and for working American families to 
subsidize the car purchases of the wealthy elites.
  The American people have proven that they refuse to be force-fed 
these electric vehicles. They can't be pushed into buying, can't be 
bribed into buying them. ``No, thank you,'' said the American consumer.
  But that is exactly what the Democrats have been trying to do--to ban 
traditional vehicles and to bribe people to buy electric vehicles. 
Democrats want to pick what you can drive. They want to punish everyone 
who doesn't want to do it--all as a result of their smug, moral 
superiority.
  Well, I have a message for my colleagues. It is the same message that 
Americans sent in November. When taxpayers and voters went to the 
polls, they said: Government--big government, Democrat government--does 
not know better than we the people. Senate Democrats don't know better 
than we the people. We the people have a right to decide what is best 
for us, what is best for our families.
  The incoming Trump administration and the Republican Senate majority 
will get rid of the Biden car bribe and the Biden car ban. We are going 
to embrace free enterprise and fiscal responsibility. We will lower 
prices for the American families and restore America's energy 
independence and dominance.
  We are going to strengthen our manufacturing. We are going to bring 
back good-paying jobs. We are going to put Americans back in the 
driver's seat.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.


                              Agriculture

  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, our farm economy is headed in a 
dark and scary direction. I hope all of my colleagues here in the 
Senate and on the other side of the Capitol recognize that.
  It is time for Congress to deliver meaningful assistance to our 
agricultural producers. They have been devastated by unprecedented 
market conditions and natural disasters over the last 2 years, and they 
need help recovering from both, not one or the other.
  I rise today to urge my colleagues to take action and to support 
those who support you.
  The economic landscape for farmers is looking more like the farm 
crisis of the 1980s every day.
  That is pretty scary.
  There is not a farm crisis looming--it is already underway--but it is 
not too late to keep it from snowballing out of control if Congress 
acts.
  The farm crisis of the 1980s--I remember so well--was one of the 
worst economic disasters since the Great Depression that decimated 
rural America and took years for many communities to recover from. Some 
never did. What caused the crisis? Inflation, high interest rates and 
production costs, low farm income, depressed crop prices, declining 
exports, and inadequate Federal price support policy.
  Does that sound familiar?
  The U.S. farm income has dropped $41 billion over the last 2 years--
the worst decline we have ever seen. Our trade deficit is expected to 
reach a record high of $45.5 billion for fiscal year 2025. Input costs 
and interest rates are close to an alltime high; commodity prices are 
low; and the Federal farm safety net is not providing any support 
because the Price Loss Coverage Program's reference prices haven't been 
updated since the 2014 farm bill. These are unprecedented market 
conditions. Believe me, I know.
  To break this down in greater detail, market losses suffered by 
producers for the 2024 crop year alone are estimated at $31 billion--
$31 billion with a ``b.''
  I have a breakdown of the market losses by State and commodity. I ask 
unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, every single State in the United 
States suffered market losses this crop-year. The Office of Management 
and Budget recently submitted a disaster supplemental request to 
Congress asking for $21 billion in ad hoc support for producers 
impacted by natural disasters in 2023 and in 2024, and I certainly 
support that because many producers across the country deserve it.
  However, OMB's request failed to mention anything pertaining to 
market losses. How can we ignore $31 billion in market losses this year 
alone and expect to keep U.S. agriculture afloat? We shouldn't, and we 
can't. Farmers need market loss assistance, too. We need an additional 
$15 billion for market losses.
  The House and Senate Agriculture Committees have been working on a 
proposal that would cover market losses on top of natural disaster 
losses. It is estimated to cost about $15 billion. Congress should 
support that, whether through supplemental appropriations or a farm 
bill extension, in addition to what has been proposed for natural 
disasters. Producers should be eligible for both.
  State farm bureaus from all 50 States have sent letters to Congress 
asking for both market and disaster assistance--both, not one or the 
other. Further, every major agricultural organization across the 
country--the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean 
Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley 
Growers Association, National Cotton Council, National Corn Growers 
Association, National Sorghum Producers, National Sunflower 
Association, U.S. Canola Association, U.S. Peanut Federation, USA Dry 
Pea & Lentil Council, USA Rice, and Western Peanut Growers 
Association--have endorsed marker legislation, introduced in the House, 
focused on market losses.
  If Congress fails to recognize the importance of providing market 
loss help and only focuses on natural disaster, my fear is that, one, 
farmers and farm groups across the country are going to be very angry 
that Congress decided to address only half the problem while ignoring 
every farmer across the country impacted by record input costs and 
depressed prices, and, two, we are going to have a farm crisis in this 
country worse than the 1980s crisis.
  I will leave my colleagues with this question: Are we going to learn 
from lessons of the past and take appropriate action or take the path 
of least resistance today and be required to pay hundreds of billions 
on the back end after it is too late?
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.


                   Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act

  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, a little while ago, my colleagues 
were successful in passing the Stop International Child Abuse Act by 
unanimous consent.
  I want to thank Paris Hilton for her great work on this legislation. 
You know, I applaud her for using her position of influence as a force 
for good. She has worked hard to make sure no child has to go through 
what she went through in her earlier life.
  America's kids and young adults will decide the future of this 
country. I dedicated my life to mentoring young people because they are 
the most precious commodity that we have. If we get everything else 
right but neglect our young people, our country has no future.
  You know, I have seen some of these residential treatment facilities 
with my own eyes, and I know they need reform. Right now, there is not 
enough oversight in some of these schools. Some States are trying to 
regulate them, but we need to do more on a national level. We don't 
know where the Federal money is going or who is making money off 
looking after our kids. We don't understand the regulations and whether 
they benefit our children or not. This bill authorizes a study of these 
facilities and looks at them nationwide. It can cost about what it 
takes to go to Harvard for a kid to be in one of these institutions. It 
is very expensive, but a lot of them look like something out of a 
Charles Dickens movie.
  There is an old saying that sunlight is the best disinfectant. We 
need some more sunlight on these facilities so we can put a stop to the 
waste and the

[[Page S6955]]

fraud and the abuse in this system. I am proud to support this bill, 
and I stand with our kids.


                            Social Security

  Madam President, now I would like to remind you of a vote that 
President Joe Biden took in 1983, as a Senator, to tax your Social 
Security. That is right. Joe Biden is responsible for your Social 
Security money today being taxed. It is a scam.
  One of the big reasons the American people elected President Trump to 
be the next President of the United States is because they are tired of 
being scammed by the Federal Government. They are tired of seeing their 
hard-earned money evaporate into thin air because of inflation, which 
is caused by Joe Biden and Democrats spending money that we don't have.
  They are tired of having their tax dollars sent to fund foreign wars 
where America's interests are really not at stake. They are tired of 
the Federal Government using taxpayer dollars to put illegal immigrants 
up in fancy hotels instead of building a wall to secure our Nation's 
sovereignty. But what the American people have been tired of for 
years--decades even--is how they have been getting scammed out of their 
retirement money, the money that they pay into this government.
  Here is the sad truth: The American people don't have any confidence 
that they will see all the money they paid into Social Security over 
the years.
  Since being signed into law in the 1930s by President Roosevelt, 
Americans' money has been going in the front door of the Federal 
Government and then out the back door. It is a big Ponzi scheme, and 
everyone is forced to participate in it. You have no choice. It doesn't 
matter if you are 16 or 76, a little over 6 percent of your paycheck is 
taken out to pay for this retirement.
  Americans have been paying into Social Security for years, only to 
see a fraction of what they were promised to be returned to them. And 
that is not all. After decades of having Social Security taken out of 
their paychecks, millions of Americans have to pay taxes on what they 
do get at the end of the day. That is right. The money that is owed to 
them--the taxpayers' own money that has been held for years by the 
Federal Government--is taxed again as if it is new income.
  Withdrawing money from your paycheck every week or month for Social 
Security is already a tax to begin with. The money taken out of your 
pocket and your paychecks isn't put into an account that gains interest 
like a mutual fund. It doesn't even gain interest like a savings 
account. It actually has a lower rate of interest than the rate of 
inflation. And that is not the worst of it.
  The pot your Social Security money sits in isn't left alone by the 
Federal Government. No, your money that you pay into Social Security is 
being used like a debit card by the Federal Government. So the money 
you are paying into, it is effectively a tax. Then what little money 
you do get back is taxed again.
  We have got people who are getting ready to retire in this country 
who are going to try to live off $2,000 a month after paying Social 
Security all their life.
  In this day and age, $2,000 is impossible to live off of, totally 
impossible. We better start figuring this problem out because one of 
these days, millions of people are going to come to DC and say: Where 
is my money? And I don't blame them. I don't blame them one bit.
  We are $36 trillion in debt, and there is no sign of that slowing 
down. Let me repeat that: $36 trillion in debt.
  We seem to be spending all we can on everything but retired American 
workers. We have sent over $200 billion to Ukraine. Just yesterday, the 
Biden administration announced they are giving $20 billion more to 
Ukraine in the form of a loan. Well, that is interesting. We are never 
getting that money back. It is another scam.
  Over $400 billion in COVID relief money was wasted, misspent, or 
stolen. And I just saw on TV before I just came down here on a news 
report that President Biden just gave Iran 10 billion more dollars.
  The Biden administration set aside billions of dollars to build EV 
stations across this country, plug-ins. Up here, we toss money around 
like it is nothing, and then we turn around and tax Americans' Social 
Security checks. It is unfair for the millions of Americans who paid 
into Social Security to have to suffer for their government's 
incompetence.
  My two sons ask me all the time if they are ever going to see the 
money they have paid into Social Security. At this rate, they have got 
a better chance of seeing world war III than ever seeing that 6 percent 
that was taken out of their paychecks since they started working. How 
bleak is that?
  That is why when President Trump says he wants to fight for Social 
Security to protect it and preserve the retirement age, it resonates 
with people. People listen because it sounds like somebody is going to 
help somebody.
  The American people aren't dumb. They know there has been funny 
business going on at the Social Security Administration for many, many 
years and that they may never see a dime of the money that they are 
owed.
  Americans aren't dumb. Every election year, you hear our Democratic 
colleagues saying Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits or 
raise the retirement age. Yet it was Joe Biden who voted to tax your 
Social Security check. As usual, our Democratic colleagues just keep 
throwing money at other programs, projects, and wars, neglecting one of 
the biggest problems facing our country.
  With President Trump coming to town, we are finally going to make 
sure the government is serving the people, not bleeding them dry. 
President Trump is going to make sure the government is accountable to 
all American taxpayers. At the very least, he is going to give it to 
you straight, not just tell you what you want to hear.
  The Department of Government Efficiency--or what we are calling now 
DOGE--will play a big role in solving this problem. Elon and Vivek will 
make sure the American people know exactly what is going on in 
Washington. There will be no secrets.
  The bottom line is this: We need to get bureaucrats' and politicians' 
hands out of the mess that they made with their Social Security money. 
We need to make sure Americans get what they were promised.
  President Trump's pick to be the Commissioner of the Social Security 
Administration is a great choice to get Social Security cleaned up. If 
he doesn't, we will change him. Frank has an excellent track record as 
an executive in business and finance. He is not a politician. As 
President Trump said, Commissioner Frank will deliver on the Agency's 
commitment to the American people for generations to come.
  It is about time Washington, DC, starts working for the people we are 
supposed to represent--what a thought--not to special interests, not 
for career politicians and entrenched bureaucrats or the liberal pet 
projects or foreign wars that don't deserve our interest.
  Instead of spending money we don't have on things we don't need, 
let's put it back in the pockets of the Americans who have worked and 
paid for this. Not only is it in America's best interest to do this, it 
is the right thing to do.
  I yield the floor.
  (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Padilla). The Senator from Tennessee.


                           National Security

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, last week, I spoke in this Chamber 
about President Trump's excellent picks to lead our Nation's Federal 
law enforcement Agencies. Those were Pam Bondi as Attorney General and 
Kash Patel at the FBI. And, today, I would like to take a moment to 
discuss President Trump's picks to oversee our Nation's national 
security.
  Across the board, these selections prove that President Trump is 
prepared to restore American strength after 4 years of the Biden-Harris 
failures in our Nation's national security. Look no further than the 
President's outstanding choice for Defense Secretary. That is 
Tennessean Pete Hegseth. As a Bronze Star recipient who deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Hegseth knows exactly what our servicemembers 
need to defend our freedoms. He knows what the men and women in uniform 
need to carry out their mission.
  Under President Biden, this administration has demoralized our 
soldiers,

[[Page S6956]]

sailors, marines, and airmen--from anti-American DEI programs to 
weakness and appeasement abroad. Under Mr. Hegseth, this assault on our 
military will come to an end as he works to restore the Defense 
Department to its core mission: securing peace through strength.
  Joining him in this fight are three talented congressional 
colleagues: our colleague here in the Senate, Senator Marco Rubio of 
Florida, as Secretary of State; Congressman Mike Waltz as the National 
Security Advisor; and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations. All three are proven leaders who have stood up 
to our adversaries, strengthened relationships with our allies, and 
defended U.S. interests.
  To restore American strength, we also need intelligence Agencies that 
are focused on protecting the American people, not targeting them. 
Thankfully, President Trump's pick for Director of National 
Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has demonstrated the leadership needed to 
restore accountability at the DNI. As a lieutenant colonel for over 20 
years in the U.S. Army Reserves, she has seen firsthand the critical 
role of intelligence in national security. She handled highly 
classified information, led troops on deployments, and understands the 
gravity of safeguarding American lives.
  But what sets Ms. Gabbard apart is her willingness to challenge the 
status quo. For years, she has been an outspoken critic of abuses 
within the intel community, especially under the Biden-Harris 
administration. Under her leadership, though, the intel community will 
return to its rightful purpose: defending the American people and 
upholding our constitutional freedoms.
  America shines as a beacon of freedom in our dangerous world because 
of the powerful sacrifices our Active-Duty servicemembers and veterans 
have made to preserve freedom. Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting 
with our next VA Secretary, former Congressman and Air Force veteran 
Doug Collins, who will ensure that no veteran is left behind and that 
all veterans receive the benefits and timely access to quality care 
that they deserve.
  With all of President Trump's picks, he is making one thing clear, 
and it is this: Starting in January, his administration is committed to 
supporting our troops, restoring military readiness, and making America 
stronger than ever before.


                         Kids Online Safety Act

  Mr. President, I am so pleased to spend a few minutes on the floor 
and just really so honored that my colleague Senator Blumenthal is 
joining me on the floor, because we are at crunch time for the Kids 
Online Safety Act.
  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is a piece of legislation that 
Senator Blumenthal and I have worked on for about 4 years. And we are 
so honored that 72 Members of this Chamber stand as cosponsors of this 
legislation, and it passed out of this Chamber in July on a vote that 
was 91 to 3. So it is time to hold that final vote on this legislation 
in the House.
  Now, there is a lot of misinformation that is out there about the 
Kids Online Safety Act. And if we can get this passed in the remaining 
few days, what you will have is, for the first time since 1998, there 
will be legislation passed to protect our children in the virtual space 
and provide safeguards for minors.
  You know, when you look at product design and product safety, nearly 
every product--every product--that is sold in this country has some 
kind of safety design attached; that is, every product except what you 
are seeing in the virtual space. And, of course, while we have laws in 
the physical space that protect children from the harms of alcohol, 
tobacco, and firearms and protect them from cyber bullying and protect 
them from exposure to sexual exploitation or pornography, in the 
virtual space, we do not have those laws.
  KOSA has been in the House, as I said, since July, and it has stalled 
over there because there are blatant falsehoods that are being peddled 
by the Big Tech lobbyists about this legislation, including one that 
they have made up--a falsehood. They keep saying: Well, KOSA would lead 
to censorship. Nothing is further from the truth because this is not a 
content bill; it is a product design bill.
  So to put this false narrative to rest, Senator Blumenthal and I 
worked with Elon Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino to update the bill's 
text to make clear that KOSA will safeguard free speech while 
protecting children online.
  To be clear, no one is probably more qualified to speak on the issue 
of free speech than Elon Musk.
  Among the changes is language that reaffirms that KOSA does not 
permit the government to penalize platforms based on users' viewpoints 
or alter existing protections for third-party content under section 
230. These are protections that have been put in place.
  With the new changes, both Elon Musk and Donald Trump, Jr., are now 
publicly calling on the House to immediately pass the bill, which is 
also supported by tech companies like Microsoft and Pinterest--and for 
good reason.
  Every day--every day--that goes by without passing the Kids Online 
Safety Act, more children are being put at risk, more children are 
losing their lives. And for years, my colleagues and I on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee and the Commerce Committee have heard heartbreaking 
stories from parents across the country who have lost their children to 
social media harms. I could read through these stories today. They are 
heartbreaking. We know from working with these parents, from listening 
to these parents, and also listening to young people, listening to 
pediatricians and principals--we know what is happening in the virtual 
space. We know that Big Tech looks at these children as the product.
  We know that they are so invested in keeping kids endlessly 
scrolling. Meta has even assigned a dollar value to what a child in the 
virtual space is worth to them as they look at profits. That is $270 of 
profit per kid. That is what they consider.
  Children, grandchildren are important to each and every one of us, 
and it is disgusting that you have corporate executives who have done 
so much work and so much surveying and so much review of how their 
platform is used, they can tell you what that user is worth.
  These companies should be better than that. They should agree that in 
the physical space, we have those laws to protect children, to protect 
them from exposure. They do not exist in the virtual space.
  And for the naysayers and the falsehood spreaders that are out there 
saying this would compromise free speech, as I said, we have addressed 
this; we have amended language; we have brought it forth; and you now 
have X CEO Linda Yaccarino, you have Elon Musk, and others who are 
tweeting in support and are saying to the House Republicans: It is time 
to pass this legislation.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my profound 
thanks to Senator Blackburn for her leadership as a champion of the 
Kids Online Safety Act.
  We have worked together over these years--yes, it has been years--
through the hearings, the drafting, the redrafting, the revisions on 
the redraft. Tirelessly, she has been a partner--and a true bipartisan 
partner--as have been Senator Schumer and Senator Thune, Senator 
McConnell and Senator Cruz.
  I want to give my thanks to colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
bringing us to this truly momentous and historic point in advocating 
for the Kids Online Safety Act. I am grateful to them and to Chair 
McMorris Rodgers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Representatives Bilirakis and Casar, and to all who have joined us from 
the tech community, including supportive companies like Microsoft and 
Pinterest. Their leaders have endorsed this legislation.

  I express my appreciation as well to Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino.
  Over the weekend, we negotiated a redraft that clarifies what we have 
said all along: This bill is about product design. It is about 
protecting kids from toxic content driven at them by products designed 
specifically to addict them, to take them down dark rabbit holes, to 
drive toxic content about bullying and eating disorders, self-harm, 
even suicide--a scourge that every parent in the United States 
recognizes must be stopped and stopped now--not

[[Page S6957]]

next session or the session afterward--because children are dying.
  They are literally in peril every day, as we know, because we are 
parents, we are grandparents, we are public officials who visited 
schools where young people, elementary school students, tell us about 
how their companions, their friends, their family members are harmed 
day in and day out and resort to suicide because no one is protecting 
them.
  We are saying the Kids Online Safety Act will give you protection. It 
will give you tools and safeguards so you can take back your online 
lives and so that the bullies can't follow you, literally, into your 
bedroom at night. They are not confined to the schoolyard anymore but 
free to follow kids wherever they go because they are in jeopardy 
everywhere.
  What we clarified is that there is no censorship in this bill. There 
is no content moderation. There is no blocking of specific content. It 
is about choice--giving young people choice and their parents 
safeguards, tools to protect their children, and imposing a duty of 
care, which other producers of any kind of product know they have. They 
have a duty of care to stop harm when they know or should know it is 
going to cause physical or emotional harm to people they should 
protect.
  We are now one step away. We are so close to the Kids Online Safety 
Act becoming law. This measure passed in this body 91 to 3. How many 
measures pass the U.S. Senate these days by 91 to 3? Major steps 
forward in legislation passing with that kind of bipartisan support is 
virtually unheard of.
  And today, in the House of Representatives--let me just be very 
blunt--it will pass by the same overwhelming bipartisan majority if it 
is given a vote. Let them vote. Let them do their job. I call on the 
House leadership to simply enable the democratic process to move 
forward.
  We based this legislation on the kind of process that is the ideal 
here. We started with a recognition that the United States of America 
faces a mental health crisis. We can all give speeches. We can all 
recite the rhetoric about the mental health crisis in America that 
afflicts teens and preteens--a dramatic increase in anxiety, 
depression, eating disorders, and suicide. We can all agree--we do all 
agree--that social media is exacerbating and, indeed, fueling that 
mental health crisis in America.
  Senator Blackburn and I have worked over years through hearings to 
demonstrate that kids' online safety is an idea whose time has come 
now. We heard from young people and parents across the country who have 
shared their experiences. They have come forward. They are our 
strongest supporters and advocates.
  We received documents from whistleblowers demonstrating that 
Facebook--now known as Meta--consciously knew its products were harming 
people, and they continued because it made money. They knew that they 
were attracting more eyeballs for longer periods of time and, 
therefore, more advertisers collecting more data. It is all about the 
money.
  They decided to put profits ahead of young people. And that is not 
from us; it is from their own documents that we can draw those 
conclusions. We brought in the Big Tech executives, and we grilled them 
on their appalling business practices. They said to us: Yeah, we know 
regulation is necessary. And they repeated it as a mantra when we had 
hearings: Regulation is important, just not that regulation.
  Let me just say, bluntly, I challenge Meta, Facebook, and Google to 
support this legislation as Microsoft and Pinterest and now Elon Musk 
have done. Don't tell us it is a censorship measure. Don't tell us you 
are defending the First Amendment or free expression. Listen to Elon 
Musk, the champion of First Amendment free expression among tech 
executives, who now supports this bill because the arguments that you 
have given to us about censorship and free expression, the money that 
you have spent to fight this legislation, the armies of lawyers and 
lobbyists that still you use against us, simply cannot overcome the 
voices and faces of young people who have been harmed.
  I want you to meet some of them. You know, there is a saying that 
every good story has a villain, a victim, and a hero. Our heroes are 
the young people and parents who have come forward to watch this 
moment. The world is watching us in the U.S. Congress at this moment. 
And the victims are young people and parents--parents who suffered 
losses of their children. Some of them are with us here today in spirit 
to demonstrate the cost of congressional delay and inaction, the cost 
that every parent should fear and feel today.
  That is what happened to Mason Edens, who is here in this picture. 
Mason loved football and loved making other people smile. He wanted to 
serve his country when he grew up. He talked about becoming a police 
officer.
  In 2022, Mason experienced his first heartbreak. Quickly after, 
Microsoft's algorithms inundated him with messages promoting self-harm. 
He even sought help on TikTok. But instead of providing that help, 
TikTok sent him more suicidal messages. He was trapped in a rabbit 
hole.
  Depressed, having lost control, in November of 2022, Mason--this 
young man--took his own life at the age of 16.
  I have four children. They are a lot older than 16 now, but every one 
of us knows a 16-year-old. We know how vulnerable young people are at 
that age.
  TikTok is delighted to addict kids at all costs. What happened to 
Mason is a consequence of their business model. It is not some random 
occurrence. It is the direct result of a business model that is 
unconscionable.
  And his death was preventable. He is just one of a dozens of deaths 
and horrific harms that we know happened while Congress waited--we 
waited and we waited--to pass the Kids Online Safety Act.
  Another one of those victims is T'Saya Yapuncich. T'Saya was a Native 
American girl, young woman. Her name means eagle woman, one with Earth, 
and little huntress.
  Her parents did what they could to set rules around her use of social 
media, but they didn't know that TikTok and Snapchat began to connect 
T'Saya with sexual predators. They exploited her trust. By age 11, 
T'Saya was experiencing self-harm and suicidal ideation--again, fueled 
by social media. No matter what help her parents tried to get her, 
T'Saya sank deeper into depression.
  This Saturday, T'Saya would have reached 16 years old. Instead, she 
took her life last March--again, one of a dozen, like Jesse Harrington.
  Jesse is here. He wanted to be a firefighter when he grew up. He 
wanted to save lives. He didn't get his first phone until last 
Christmas, at age 15. That is a pretty late age to be getting a phone 
these days.
  He became addicted, unable to sleep, unable to look away from endless 
scrolling, unable to look away from the nudges of Instagram, Snapchat 
and TikTok. And he began having trouble in school, getting into 
conflicts with others.
  Now, that part of the story, I think, occurs thousands and millions 
of times in America today--the distraction, unable to look away, the 
addictive impact.
  On October 29 of this year, Jesse took his life. That part of the 
story, fortunately, is not common to as many children. But for Jesse, 
it was the end. Police found his device open and streaming when they 
arrived.
  Mason, T'Saya, and Jesse were all horrific experiences. They didn't 
need to happen. They were preventable. We have examples and examples. I 
could spend the rest of the day into tomorrow with more specific 
examples: suicide, self-harm, bullying, eating disorders, fentanyl 
poisoning, sexual exploitation. All of it happens right now, right here 
in America, in realtime, to our young people.
  That is not the message we want to send to America as a Congress. 
Senator Blackburn and I have addressed every single issue that Big Tech 
has thrown in our way. There are no excuses for delay. Anybody saying, 
``Let's wait until next session so we can get it really right,'' that 
is saying they are OK with more kids dying. They are, in effect, with 
all due respect, playing political games with those lives that are at 
risk today in realtime in America--more families shattered, like Mason, 
T'Saya, Jesse. When I say shattered, I mean shattered.
  I want to finish by quoting another mom, someone who has been a 
fierce

[[Page S6958]]

advocate for this legislation. I have come to know her from this fight. 
I greatly respect her and admire her courage and strength: Deb Schmill.
  Deb told me, and I am quoting:

       Letting it go to the next legislature means children are 
     going to die. It means another year of children dying. And 
     who wants to be accountable for that?
       We can't wait another year. We need this now.

  Now, we can't bring back her daughter Becca, a beautiful young woman, 
or Mason or T'Saya or Jesse, but we can prevent other families from 
suffering the worse loss imaginable. We have it within reach to do it. 
Passing the Kids Online Safety Act is not some convenient step we can 
take to make people feel good. It is real action.
  We don't often, here in this body, have an opportunity to save lives, 
to save futures, to save young people. We have that opportunity now.
  I challenge the House of Representatives to do the right thing. Pass 
the Kids Online Safety Act.
  I yield the floor.


            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar

  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, at 
5:15 today, I ask the Chair to execute the order of November 20 with 
respect to the Wise nomination.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The Senator from Delaware.


                         Farewell to the Senate

  Mr. CARPER. As you know, we have a term called ``seatmates,'' and, 
for years, this man has been my seatmate, and I have never been prouder 
of him for all that he does.
  It is wonderful to be your friend and colleague.
  Well, thank you very much to the Presiding Officer and to our 
colleagues who are coming in to join us.
  In just a few weeks, I will be stepping down as one of Delaware's two 
U.S. Senators, ending a half century of service in the U.S. Navy and in 
elective office.
  God willing, in the weeks that follow, Martha, my bride of 38 years, 
who is sitting right up there, and I will turn the page and hit the 
road together, visiting family members near and far and exploring parts 
of America that we have yet to see, before beginning to look for new 
ways to serve the people of Delaware and our country.
  Recently, a friend told me that I have lived a charmed life. And do 
you know what? He is right. I have been truly blessed. Although, truth 
be known, it didn't start that way.
  My sister Sheila and I were born in a coal-mining town in West 
Virginia. We didn't have much, but we had the good fortune of being 
raised in a home by parents who instilled in us a strong work ethic, 
along with a deep faith that embraced the Golden Rule: to treat other 
people the way that we want to be treated. Our parents also instilled 
in us an abiding love for our country and for this planet that we call 
home. Our father and most of our uncles served in World War II or in 
Korea or both.
  My mother's youngest brother, Bob Patton was killed at the age of 19 
in a kamikaze attack on his aircraft carrier in the Pacific, in 1944. 
His body was never recovered. Our grandmother was a Gold Star mother.
  This life-size--bigger, actually; bigger than life-size--picture of 
him in his dress blues still hangs in my Senate office here on Capitol 
Hill. He was my hero when I was a kid growing up, and, truth be known, 
he still is.
  Our parents never went to college, but they wanted us to go, and they 
expected my sister and I to figure out how to pay for it. Fortunately, 
in my senior year in high school, I won a Navy ROTC scholarship, and 
with the help of that scholarship, I was able to work a couple of jobs 
at Ohio State, including washing pots and pans, in order to keep from 
starving.
  And I graduated at the height of the Vietnam war and would go on to 
complete three tours of duty in Southeast Asia as a naval flight 
officer and eventually as a Navy P-3 aircraft mission commander.
  The best days of the week for us on those 6-month deployments were 
the days that the mail came, bringing cards, care packages, newspapers, 
and magazines. And following the 1972 election, the issues of both Time 
and Newsweek included stories of a stunning upset in Delaware, where a 
29-year-old upstart named Joe Biden defeated an icon--a Delaware icon--
named Caleb Boggs.
  I remember over, literally, on the other side of the world, thinking: 
I would like to meet that young guy some day and see what he is made 
of. And then, one day, that is what I did.
  Later on, after I fulfilled my military obligation, I enrolled in the 
University of Delaware's M.B.A. program. Within a week of enrolling, I 
affiliated with the Reserve Navy P-3 aircraft squadron in nearby 
Pennsylvania, and I found a place to live in Delaware.
  Shortly thereafter, I had just a chance meeting with a professor at 
the University of Delaware, on campus there, who was planning to run 
for Congress, and I got to know him. And later--not much later--he 
asked me to be his campaign treasurer, and I agreed. I think I had been 
in Delaware for like a couple of months, and I found myself as a 
campaign treasurer all of a sudden.
  Miraculously, I was invited, a month or two after that, to join a pep 
talk and a strategy session at the home of none other than Delaware's 
junior Senator, Joe Biden. And that day, he could not have been more 
gracious, more helpful. After learning of my military service in 
Southeast Asia, he embraced me and welcomed me to Delaware, marking the 
beginning of a friendship that has lasted for 50 years.
  Following the completion of my M.B.A. studies, I went to work in 
economic development for the State of Delaware. Less than a year later, 
when no Democrat volunteered to run for State treasurer, I offered to 
run and was elected State treasurer at the age of 29, on the same day 
that Republican Pete du Pont was elected our State's Governor.
  When I called my parents in Florida and told them that I had been 
elected State treasurer at 29, they said: You don't even know how to 
spell ``cash management.'' How are you going to do that?
  And 2 months later, in his very first State address in the 
legislative hall, Governor Pete du Pont announced that the State of 
Delaware was bankrupt, and, later that week, Delaware's credit rating 
fell to the lowest of any State in America.
  There I was, 29 years old, and I thought: What do I do now?
  Well, as it turned out, even though I didn't know a lot about cash 
management, the end of the story is a pretty good one. And we may not 
have known a lot in those days about cash management, but what we did 
have, fortunately, on our side was a new Governor who quickly put 
together a talented team to turn our State around. And he invited me, a 
Democrat of all things, to become part of that team. And remarkably, it 
worked. It worked, and less than 4 years later, Delaware's credit 
rating was about to be raised to a respectable AA, after it had been 
literally at the bottom. We were ready to go to AA within a couple of 
years, and the Governor asked me, of all people, to announce to the 
world that our credit rating was being raised to AA.

  And following that announcement--I did make the announcement--I got a 
lot of attention. But in the regularly scheduled election, a week 
later, the people of Delaware elected me to serve as their lone 
Congressman, unseating the incumbent Republican. And the rest, as they 
say, is history.
  So what lessons might we all take from this? For me, one lesson was 
that our elected leaders surrounded themselves with the best people 
they could find. Another key lesson was that in adversity lies 
opportunity. I have probably said that about a million times: In 
adversity lies opportunity.
  The third lesson was the importance of job creation, and the 
realization is that, while our elected leaders don't create jobs, we 
help create a nurturing environment that supports job creation.
  In addition, I learned from Joe Biden that all politics is personal 
and that all diplomacy is personal.
  And I learned that just because someone is your adversary one day, 
they don't have to become your enemy. They don't have to become your 
enemy.
  And I also learned an ancient proverb that some of you have heard 
along the way, and it goes something like this: If you give a person a 
fish, you can feed them for a day. If you teach a person to

[[Page S6959]]

fish, they can feed themselves and their families for a lifetime.
  Since announcing, over a year ago, that I would not be running for 
reelection, I have had a number of interviews, and among the questions 
that have been asked of me are a lot that you might have been asked 
yourselves, but one of the questions is: Why did you decide not to run 
for reelection?
  And I tell them tongue-in-cheek--only partly in cheek--that I was 
following the advice of singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers, whom I met my 
senior year at Ohio State, trying to get him and his group to come to a 
concert at Ohio State, and I would meet him again as Governor of 
Delaware, 30 years later. He was the second best male recording artist 
in history.
  Then I met him again at the State fair, 30 years later. He did not 
remember me from Ohio State, but he asked me if there was a song that I 
would like for him to sing and dedicate to me that night at the State 
fair, with like 10,000 people in the stands. I said that would be 
great. And I asked him to sing ``The Gambler'':

       You've got to know when to hold'em; [got to] know when to 
     fold'em.

  And when I announced, with Martha by my side, years later, those 
words--I announced that I wasn't going to run. I gave a little tribute 
to Kenny Rogers, and he is getting another shout-out here today.
  But among the questions that I have also been asked of late is: What 
are you proudest of in your 24 years in the Senate? And one of them is 
building a trusting partnership on the Environment and Public Works 
Committee with Ranking Member Shelley Capito, who is seated right over 
there, whose father was the Governor of West Virginia when my sister 
and I were born in West Virginia. And Shelley, like me, is a native 
West Virginian. Our committee enjoys a well-deserved reputation as a 
workhorse committee and one whose members consistently work across the 
aisle. Our relationship has enabled us, among other things, to craft a 
comprehensive 2-year Water Resources Development Act, which includes 
the reauthorization of the Economic Development Administration.
  We have also learned to and worked to advance a package of critical 
recycling bills to confirm important nominations and to enact 
transformational legislation like the bipartisan infrastructure law, 
the most transformational infrastructure law in the history of our 
country--And she and I managed this bill right out here on the floor-- 
and also to pass significant nuclear legislation like the ADVANCE Act 
and major legislation to reduce powerful greenhouse gas emissions known 
as HFC, hydrofluorocarbons. And that is just a few.

  And we have demonstrated time and time again that bipartisan 
solutions are lasting solutions; that even in today's polarized 
environment, it is still possible to accomplish a great deal for our 
country, for our planet, and for our citizens.
  There is a lot that we have helped accomplish in this Senate, but 
there remains unfinished business, as you know, that I want to 
encourage our colleagues to continue once I weigh anchor--that is a 
Navy phrase, ``weigh anchor''--and sail off into the sunrise.
  Almost daily, I am asked here in DC and in Delaware: How do you like 
being retired? How do you like being retired?
  I tell them: I am not retired, and I hope I am never truly retired. 
And I smile and tell people: I hope--I want to find other ways where I 
can continue to make a difference for as long as I live.
  In truth, I have spent many years helping to lead the effort to 
combat global warming, as some of you know, and many of you have been 
partners in that important effort. In Delaware, we are especially aware 
of the effects of climate crisis, and our State is sinking. Our State 
is sinking, and the seas around us are rising. That is not a good 
combination. Like much of our country, we are experiencing intensifying 
storms and scorching heat waves.
  My wife spent part of last month in North Carolina, Western North 
Carolina, and just saw the devastation that has been wreaked on our 
hometown many weeks ago.
  And that is why I worked so hard to help pass the Inflation Reduction 
Act with some of you, which is a prime example of a package that 
reduces, on the one hand, the cost of prescription medicines while also 
helping us to fight the climate crisis and, just as important, creating 
hundreds of thousands of new American jobs, good paying American jobs. 
The night that we voted here in this Chamber on that bill, we stayed up 
all night. We finished up at about 6 in the morning. As many of you 
will recall, it passed by one vote, and that one vote was cast by our 
Vice President, Kamala Harris, who was presiding over the Senate.
  About 6 in the morning, I walked back to my office, headed down to 
the train station to catch a train and go back to Delaware. I got there 
about 7:30, got off the train. I thought on my way home, Maybe I should 
just go by Wawa. And for the people who don't have an idea who Wawa is, 
it is convenience stores up and down the East Coast people have just a 
great affection for. And I went by Wawa to pick up a cup of coffee 
before, kind of to celebrate before I went home. And it is about 7, 8 
in the morning. The lady who was the cashier, I got a small cup of 
coffee and went to pay for it. And she said--I will never forget--she 
said: Your money is no good for a small cup of coffee. That is what she 
said: Your money is no good for a small cup of coffee.
  And I said: Could I get a bigger cup of coffee?
  (Laughter.)
  She said: No. Your money is no good for a small cup of coffee. So I 
made do on a small cup of coffee. Then she went on to say, she said: 
You have been up all night, haven't you?
  I said: Yes.
  She said: I know what you have been doing, haven't you?
  I said: Yes, ma'am.
  She said: I have a son and a daughter, and I want to make sure that 
they have a planet to grow up on and a planet to grow old on.
  And for all of us who have children or maybe nieces or nephews or 
grandchildren, the idea to make sure that--we want to make sure that 
they do have a planet to grow up on and a planet to grow old on.
  We also want to make sure that they have jobs, good jobs, so they can 
support themselves and their families.
  Now, this says I am supposed to conclude. I am not finished.
  (Laughter.)
  This is crazy. In any event, let me conclude--I am almost done, but I 
am not quite done, but let me conclude with a couple of thoughts 
relating to a date that just passed, and that was December 7. That is a 
date that in our State is well-known. It is called Delaware Day, and it 
is a celebration of December 7, 1787, the day that the people of 
Delaware ratified, through their 25 representatives, the Constitution. 
Before anybody else had, Delaware ratified the Constitution. We became 
the first State, and I hope that years from now we will continue to 
celebrate Delaware Day in my home State and, frankly, in other places, 
too. And I hope that people across our Nation will continue to be 
inspired by the words of our Founding Fathers.
  As many colleagues have heard me say here on this floor in the past, 
Ben Franklin, as he was exiting the Constitutional Convention in 
Philadelphia in 1787, was asked: Mr. Franklin, what have you brought 
here? What have you created here? He said famously:

       A Republic, if you can keep it.

  A Republic, if you can keep it. The brevity of that response should 
not cause us to undervalue its essential meaning. Democratic republics 
are not merely founded on the consent of the people, but they are 
absolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the 
people for the continued health of our democracy.
  And while there were many things that our Founding Fathers disagreed 
upon, the one thing that they all agreed on, as you know, is that they 
didn't want America ever to be ruled by a king. They wanted to make 
sure that never happened. And you know what? We still feel that way 
today.
  When we pledge allegiance to the flag or take an oath to defend the 
Constitution against its enemies, foreign and domestic, we don't pledge 
our allegiance to a person or to party. We pledge our allegiance to the 
country and the Constitution under which we were established.
  Let me just close, if I can. I want to thank all of my current and 
former

[[Page S6960]]

staff members for joining. Probably have a bunch of them today, and a 
lot are watching as well.
  Somebody came up with the word ``Carpertown.'' I don't know who, but 
I love it. And it refers--it is kind of like, remember the song by the 
Eagles, ``Hotel California''? ``You can check out, but you can never 
leave.'' Carpertown is like that. And there are a lot of people in 
Carpertown. And for people that worked with me in the Navy and State 
Treasurer, Congressman, Governor, Senator, to today.
  But I want to ask unanimous consent that all of the names of my 
Senate staff here and back in Delaware be printed in the Congressional 
Record.

  Mr. CARPER. I just want to take a moment, if I could, to thank my 
family Martha, who is seated right up here to my right. And over the 
years, I have spoken with members of the Armed Forces who are married, 
and I have not only thanked them for their service, but I have also 
thanked their spouses for their service. You know, I have got the 
person in the uniform; the spouse is not wearing a uniform, but that 
spouse has served just as much as the person in uniform.
  And I want to just say that during the years that I have been 
privileged to serve as a naval officer, as a Congressman, as a Governor 
and treasurer, and Senator and all, my wife Martha has served as well 
as I have, and we are in her debt. And God knows I am in her debt.
  Martha, thank you. I love you.
  I am also proud to have helped raise three boys who have gone on to 
become terrific young men that any parent would be proud to call their 
own, and I also want to salute those who served alongside me 
representing Delaware, including Members of the Delaware congressional 
delegation, over the years--people like Ted Kaufman. I am sure our 
leader here remembers Ted who succeeded Joe Biden; and Mike Castle, who 
was a House Member, Governor of the State; John Carney, our Governor, 
former Congressman, and gone on to be mayor of Wilmington pretty soon; 
and Joe Biden. Those are just some of the people I have gotten to serve 
with in the House and the Senate.
  But I especially want to note my fellow Senator Chris Coons, sitting 
over to my right. How are you doing, bud?
  We call each other a lot of things, but I call him ``wingman.'' And 
he is my wingman, and I am his as well. He has always had my back, and 
I will always have his. Chris is one of the smartest people and 
brightest people I think I have ever worked with. He surrounds himself 
with terrific people as well. He is the senior member of the Foreign 
Relations Committee. He has traveled the world, and he knows the 
world's leaders like I think none of us ever have. He calls Delaware 
home, and I know he will continue to represent our State very, very 
well.
  And now let me just mention our Senator-elect. I don't know if she is 
here today.
  Hi, Lisa. Lisa Blunt Rochester. Lisa is a beloved Member of the U.S. 
House of Representatives, where she serves as a highly effective member 
of a much sought-after committee, and that is the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. But many years ago, she joined my congressional team as an 
intern. And from that humble beginning, she went on to become a two-
time cabinet member when I was Governor of the State of Delaware. She 
is smart, is a caring daughter, sister, mother, and now a grandmother, 
too. She leads an excellent staff and has a can-do attitude, as well as 
a deep faith. She is also a great dancer, for what it is worth.

[[Page S6961]]

  For when my Senate colleagues said to me: TC--a lot of people here 
call me TC. Some call me other things.
  (Laughter.)
  But when they say: TC, we are really going to miss you in the Senate, 
I say to them: 2 weeks after Lisa Blunt Rochester joins you in the 
Senate, you won't remember my name.
  (Laughter.)
  And they said: Oh, yes, we will. Yes, we will. I don't know that I 
believe them, but it is nice of them to say that.
  In closing, just once again let me thank the people of Delaware for 
entrusting in me the responsibility of serving them for all of these 
years. It has been a privilege. It has been a source of great joy that 
I will always cherish.
  I want to say to our leader, before I close, thank you very much for 
your kind words earlier in the morning. One of the things I understand 
he mentioned is our love for music and music lyrics. So with that in 
mind, let me close with this--with apologies to Neil Young of Crosby, 
Stills, Nash, and Young, let me end with this:

       Keep on rockin' in the free world. Keep on rockin' in the 
     free world.

  It has been my joy to be your colleague, and I am looking forward to 
getting to know all of you and working with you in Delaware, if we can 
ever be of help or support in any way at all. God bless you all. Thank 
you so much.
  (Applause. Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). The Senator from Delaware.


                      Tribute to Thomas R. Carper

  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise to speak in thanks and in 
recognition of my dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator from 
the great State of Delaware, Tom Carper.
  All of us have had a chance to hear his farewell speech, but I get a 
chance to add just a little bit here on the end.
  You know, when folks have said to Senator Carper: What do you plan on 
doing in retirement at home? He has repeatedly said: I don't plan on 
retiring.
  And this has a history to it. As you know, in the arc of his decades 
of service in our Senate and in our State, he was our Governor. And he 
has described himself many times as a ``recovering Governor'' who never 
really recovered. He never stopped being intimately interested in and 
engaged in every detail of our community.
  And I cannot thank you enough, TC, for your more than five decades of 
service to our Nation, to our State, to our party, to the world. I have 
a lot of remarks, and I will try not to use all of them, but I think 
you are the alltime champion, having been elected 14 times statewide: 
State treasurer, Congressman, Governor, Senator. You are frugal. I have 
had the experience of your having made a modest contribution to a very 
early campaign of mine, and I failed to timely deposit the check, and 
not long thereafter, you accosted me and said: You never cleared this 
check. It is in my checkbook.
  Everybody knows that you drove a fabulous minivan more than 400,000 
miles. And you took that passion for frugality and for reasonableness 
and for attention to details to being the State treasurer, as you 
shared with all of us, to restoring our triple A bond rating.
  When I first became county executive, nothing was more important than 
that lesson: Protect your bond rating. And you did a great job as State 
treasurer.
  You also are someone who as Governor had a saying you were very fond 
of: Figure out what works; do more of that.
  Figure out what works; do more of that.
  Everybody here knows he makes you say important things twice.
  And so as an active member of the National Governors Association, as 
a mentor to other Governors, as a mentor to young county elected 
officials, TC did a great job with figuring out what worked well in 
other States around the country and then applying it both at home and 
making sure that other Governors had a chance to learn from that around 
our country.
  I can't neglect Senator Carper's remarkable commitment to our 
Nation's military.
  As you saw, of all the people he could have chosen to honor in his 
farewell speech, his Uncle Bob, his family, service and sacrifice 
anchors him. Having gone on a naval ROTC scholarship to Ohio State and 
having served three tours in Vietnam and then for decades in the Navy 
Reserve, Senator Carper is the last Vietnam veteran to serve in this 
body. That is a long and proud legacy that stretches from Senators 
McCain and Kerry to Kerry to Hagel to Harkin.
  But Senator Carper, in our State, has done more to fight for the VA, 
to fight for veterans, to fight for a veterans cemetery, to fight for a 
veterans home, and to personally engage on Memorial Day with the 
families of every Delawarean who has fallen in combat in living memory. 
The decency, the commitment, the passion for those who put their life 
on the line for our Nation is unmatched in our State's history. And we 
and our Nation are grateful to you for that.
  As the chair of two different committees, HSGAC and EPW, you worked 
tirelessly to build relationships, even with some of the most famously 
difficult of our colleagues. I make no reference to a former Senator 
from Oklahoma. I am just saying, that when you tackled postal issues, 
many of us wished you all the best. And you put your optimism and your 
positive spirit to the wheel and made real progress.
  Along with Senator Capito, of your native State of West Virginia, you 
have made amazing things happen, from WRDA to the Inflation Reduction 
Act to the bipartisan infrastructure law.
  Your passion for air quality and for clean air and for making sure 
that we preserve the blessings of our natural environment will be 
remembered fittingly by having the Bombay Hook Visitor Center named for 
you.
  We talk in Delaware about something called the Delaware Way, which I 
really principally learned from how you led as Governor. You cleaned up 
our party. You worked across the aisle. You balanced the budget. You 
managed a State of great complexity and importance. But you found it by 
building personal connections by being kind and respectful to others 
and by building a remarkable community that served alongside you.
  I don't know either where the term ``Carper Town'' came from, but it 
is an amazing network of alumni that includes people of all different 
ages and backgrounds, skills, and traditions who have been brought 
together to join your passion for public service.
  When asked at your retirement announcement what you would most miss 
about being a Senator, TC answered: ``My staff,'' which is a reminder 
that you have built an incredible community dedicated passionately to 
service.
  When I first got here to the Senate, my senior Senator was the one 
who literally showed me the ropes. He gave me the combination to the 
gym. He urged me to go to weekly Prayer Breakfast or Bible study and to 
learn from codels overseas and from time spent over meals together here 
in the Senate.
  We have been guided by our shared faith, our shared commitment to 
family, a commitment to bipartisanship, and a deep and abiding love of 
Amtrak. I will never forget a night where we were stuck for 7 hours in 
the bracing cold as two power lines shut down the Amtrak line north. 
Senator Carper remained cheerful, upbeat, and optimistic about the 
possibility that we would someday get off that train and be warm again. 
And the Newark Amtrak station is named in his honor, appropriately.
  Tom, you are a grounded man. Your childhood dreams for playing for 
the Detroit Tigers may not have been realized, but you as a native son 
of West Virginia have made an incredible mark on your adopted, beloved 
home State of Delaware. You have made a lasting mark: as State 
treasurer and Governor, as Congressman, and Senator.
  I will never forget when as a very, very young man I had just 
returned from South Africa and a member of my church arranged an 
opportunity for me to have lunch with you in the House dining room. I 
was 25. You gave me your undivided attention, your enthusiasm, your 
passion. You made me feel like the center of the world, and it had an 
enormous impact on my commitment to service.

  And when I ran for county council president--a long-shot bid that I 
should not have won in a four-way primary--and you were running for the 
U.S. Senate, an important and difficult race,

[[Page S6962]]

you didn't just call me once and wish me well; you didn't just send me 
a $50 check. You agreed to stand beside me at football games, at Wawas, 
at community picnics, and to introduce me to thousands of Delawareans.
  You have given Annie and me a gift we can never repay. I am so 
grateful for your service, your leadership, and your compassion.
  You are anchored in your family.
  And, Martha, thank you so much for being an incredible partner, not 
just to Tom but also to our State, for having been the first lady and 
for having been someone with an incredible career of accomplishment at 
DuPont and around the world. To the two of you for raising Christopher 
and Ben and Greg and for sharing them with us as well, thank you.
  You are rooted in your faith: II James teaches us, ``Faith without 
works is dead.'' And St. Francis once said: ``Preach the Gospel always; 
when necessary, use words.''
  By your acts, we have known your faith. And it has made all the 
difference. And you have changed me, our delegation, our State, and our 
world.
  Captain Carper, Bravo Zulu. Well done, sir. Thank you.
  (Applause, Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on May 22, 2023, Tom Carper told a 
crowd of admirers in Delaware that he would not seek a fifth term in 
the Senate, bringing to a close nearly 50 years in public service. Two 
days later, he delivered a keynote address at a reunion of 200 Vietnam 
war former POWs, which was held at the Nixon Library in California.
  Those two events speak volumes about the character and commitment of 
my valued colleague and good friend Tom Carper. From State treasurer to 
Governor to Congressman and Senator, Tom has been elected to statewide 
public office a record 14 times. In every way, he has justified the 
trust the people of the First State have placed in him.
  That remarkable accomplishment came after Tom served three tours of 
duty as a naval flight officer in Vietnam. He is the last veteran of 
that conflict in the Senate and a powerful and effective voice for 
those with whom he served.
  In 1991, then-Congressman Carper led a bipartisan delegation of 
Vietnam veterans back to Southeast Asia. Thanks to Tom's leadership, 
that trip helped lay the groundwork for ongoing efforts to account for 
Americans listed as missing in action. He exemplifies the ethic of the 
U.S. military that no one is left behind or ever forgotten.
  In the Senate, Tom's priorities have included improving our 
healthcare system, protecting our environment, investing in 
infrastructure, and strengthening our national security. And I feel so 
fortunate to have had the pleasure to work with Tom on many issues. As 
a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee 
following the 9/11 attacks, Tom and I were strong allies in supporting 
America's first responders. He has been a champion for the SAFER and 
AFG Programs that help provide our firefighters with the equipment, 
training, and support they need. In fact, Tom and I serve as cochairs 
of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus.
  Tom and I have also had a long partnership in strengthening the U.S. 
Postal Service. Twenty years ago, we introduced legislation that became 
law to reform the Postal Service--the first overhaul in nearly three 
decades to ensure universal service, affordable rates, and community 
access.
  Another issue that brought us together is protecting the environment 
and public health from mercury contamination, a particular threat to 
children and pregnant women. The Comprehensive National Mercury 
Monitoring Act we have championed would allow the United States to take 
a leadership role in generating a long-term mercury monitoring program 
that would benefit not only our Nation but also the world.
  And I think it would be a great tribute to Senator Carper if we 
passed that bill and got it signed into law before the end of this 
Congress.
  From Southeast Asia to Wilmington to Washington, Senator Tom Carper 
has served with great distinction. Our Nation is grateful. And I wish 
him and Martha all the best in the years to come.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.
  Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from Maine 
for her great words of serving so long with our friend and colleague 
Tom Carper.
  First of all, I want to say to Tom, I appreciate the very kind words 
that he mentioned about me and us in our work together on the 
committee. As we have said, he has dedicated nearly his entire adult 
life to the service of our country in many different ways and to the 
home State of Delaware.
  But don't let the ``Delaware'' next to his name fool you. All those 
good family values, all those good sturdy qualities of honesty and 
service, steadfastness were rooted in his birth in the great State of 
West Virginia. Anytime I tried to get anything over on him and say, 
``Yeah, but I'm from West Virginia,'' he would always say, ``I am 
too.'' So he is always very proud of his West Virginia roots. He had a 
couple of family reunions there during our time of service together.
  Then, in 2021, we had the opportunity to have an EPW field hearing in 
his birthplace of Beckley, WV, and I will tell you, at that 
particular--not one relative of mine was there, but Tom had his 
relatives there to cheer him on. So I know it was a very special 
occasion for him, and it certainly was for me as well.
  As the ranking member of the EPW Committee, serving alongside my 
chairman, Senator Carper, over the last 4 years, I have had the 
distinct pleasure to work in tandem with him on things he has 
mentioned, most especially infrastructure and energy and the 
environmental challenges our country faces. We don't always see eye to 
eye, but we have developed a relationship that is centered on trust and 
respect.
  We do talk every Thursday afternoon, and I want to tell you that I 
told your successor that I think this is something we need to continue 
because we kept that valuable relationship going through times when we 
might not have agreed and couldn't get to the same place.
  But I think it is essential that the relationship we created really 
did give us these bipartisan achievements: the surface transportation 
reauthorization legislation, the drinking water and wastewater 
infrastructure legislation. Those bills became the foundation of the 
bipartisan infrastructure law. Had they not been there, I am not sure 
we would have ended up as well as we did as a body. It is paying 
dividends in my State, in his State, in Senator Collins' State--all 
across the country.
  Additionally, we led the charge by offering the ADVANCE Act, which is 
the Advanced Nuclear Act. That bill, which is now law, I think will 
maintain America's nuclear energy leadership by encouraging more 
innovation and investment right here in our States. It sets the stage 
for the proliferation of reliable and safe nuclear power.
  We also just recently crafted our--I think it might be our second or 
third Water Resources Development Act. It is pending. Hopefully, we 
will get it across the floor here in the next day or two, and it is my 
hope that we will soon pass this. But I did name this bill, so 
everybody is going to listen to this. Get down here and vote for the 
Thomas R. Carper Water Resources Development Act. Hopefully, we will do 
it tomorrow.
  But outside of Chairman Carper the legislator and the native West 
Virginian I have known, I have gotten to know the person as well. He is 
just a very kind man. He is always advising people.
  We call them in our office--I don't know that I have ever told you 
this, but we call his sayings Carperisms. We have many Carperisms. I am 
skipping a few, but I am telling you the one that always, I think, 
embodies you, and that is to follow the Golden Rule and treat others as 
you would like to be treated. He has always shown respect to my staff, 
to our committee's witnesses, and to all of those who have worked 
together through the years.
  He is also a very pragmatic leader, obviously being elected numerous 
times in Delaware in all different kinds of posts, guided by his mantra 
of--here is another Carperism--figuring out what works and doing more 
of it. It is

[[Page S6963]]

a pretty simple thing. And he is a self-proclaimed recovering Governor, 
but he is well-versed in the art of getting things done.
  Above all, Chairman Carper is a true American. He served his country 
bravely overseas in wartime, and he has given the last 23 years of his 
life to the service of this Chamber. Chairman Carper has consistently 
dedicated himself to making our country as strong as it can be and 
delivering for the people he represents. His character, compassion, 
and, yes, dogged determination will certainly be missed in the U.S. 
Senate, but the impacts of his work will continue to make a difference 
for generations to come.
  Chairman Carper--my friend Tom--it has been an honor to work with 
you, alongside you, and deliver for our country and for the people we 
both love so very, very much. So I wish you the best--you and Martha 
the best.
  I will tell you what. That man loves his wife Martha.
  The way he talks about you in such a venerated way is the way we 
should all be talking about our loved ones. I have a deep appreciation 
for that.
  So I wish you all the best. Thanks for your years of service, your 
friendship, and thanks for giving me a little part of your heart over 
these last several years because it has really helped me, and it has 
helped us work together so well.
  Thank you.

                        Nomination of Noel Wise

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Noel Wise to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
California.
  Born in Cherry Hill, NJ, Judge Wise earned her B.S. at the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1989; her J.D., cum laude, from Nova 
Southeastern University Law School in 1993; and her J.S.M. from 
Stanford Law School in 2002. After graduating from law school, Wise 
served as a law clerk to Justice Harry Lee Anstead on Florida's Fourth 
District Court of Appeals.
  Between 1994 and 2002, Judge Wise served in various roles at the 
Department of Justice, including as a trial attorney in the 
environmental enforcement section from 1999 to 2002 and the 
environmental crimes section from 1998-1999; on detail as an assistant 
U.S. attorney from 1997 to 1998; and as an honors trial attorney from 
1994 to 1997.
  From 2002 to 2004, Judge Wise worked as of counsel at Stoel Rives, 
LLP, advising clients on civil and criminal environmental law, land 
use, energy, and grand jury inquisitions. She also litigated and 
settled civil and criminal cases in State and Federal court. From 2004 
to 2006, Judge Wise worked first as in-house counsel and later as the 
acting director/manager renewable power generation at Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company, PG&E. Before her judicial service, Wise ran her own 
law firm--Wise Gleicher--from 2006 to 2014.
  Since 2014, she has served as a judge on the Superior Court of 
California in Alameda County. During this decade of service, she has 
held several additional roles in the California judiciary, including 
working as a judge and supervising judge in the family law division; 
being a panel judge and supervising judge in the appellate division; 
and holding those same roles in the State's civil division.
  Judge Wise has issued at least 10,000 written decisions that are 
substantive orders or appealable judgments. In addition, she has 
conducted approximately 500 settlement conferences, presided over 
thousands of hearings, and issued approximately 290 decisions while 
serving on the appellate division.
  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Wise as ``well 
qualified,'' and her nomination is strongly supported by her home State 
Senators, Mr. Padilla and Ms. Butler.
  Judge Wise's judicial experience, coupled with her experience in 
public service and private practice, have prepared her to serve the 
Northern District of California honorably as a district judge.
  I am proud to support her nomination.

                          National Priorities

  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the holiday season approaches, it is 
an appropriate time to talk about our national priorities, where we are 
as a nation, and where we should be going into the future.
  Right now, tonight, as we assemble here in Washington, DC, there are 
thousands of people in this city and in the surrounding areas who are 
sleeping out on the streets. And that is not just Washington, DC, it is 
almost every major city in the country.
  When we talk about the housing crisis, it is not just homelessness, 
it is a reality that millions of people in Vermont and throughout this 
country are paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes for 
housing. We have a major housing crisis. We need to invest in low-
income and affordable housing.
  Today, in the United States, in the richest country in the history of 
the world, which today has more income and wealth inequality than it 
has ever had, while the very rich become much richer, 60 percent of our 
people are living paycheck to paycheck and millions of workers are 
earning starvation wages, barely enough to stay alive.
  The time is long overdue, when we talk about our national priorities, 
that this Congress pass a livable minimum wage. Raise that minimum wage 
to a livable level so that no worker in this country who works 40 hours 
a week lives in poverty--not a radical idea.
  In the United States today, we have a broken and dysfunctional 
healthcare system whose major function is not to provide quality, 
affordable care to our people but to make billions in profits for the 
insurance companies and the drug companies.
  The truth is that while 85 million Americans are uninsured or 
underinsured, while 60,000 die each year because they don't get to a 
doctor in time, the insurance companies and the drug companies make 
tens of billions of dollars a year in profit.

[[Page S6964]]

  The time is long overdue for the United States to do what every other 
major country on Earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all 
people as a human right. In my view, the most efficient way to do that 
is to pass a Medicare for all single payer program.
  Unbelievably, in this wealthy Nation in which three people on top own 
more wealth than the bottom half of our society, we have the highest 
rate of childhood poverty of almost any developed country on Earth, and 
on top of that, millions of parents, working-class parents, cannot find 
affordable or quality childcare. We need to make quality childcare 
available for all.
  In America today, unbelievably, in my view, 25 percent of senior 
citizens in our country are trying to survive on $15,000 a year or 
less--$15,000 a year. I don't know how anybody in America, no matter 
where you live--let alone if you are a senior citizen with additional 
healthcare and other needs--I don't know how anybody survives on 
$15,000. We need to expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap 
on taxable income so that every senior in this country can retire with 
dignity and security.
  Those are just a few of the things that, in my view, we should be 
doing in Congress if we are representing the needs of all Americans and 
not just wealthy campaign contributors in the top 1 percent.
  But tonight I want to say a few words about something that we should 
not be doing, and that is, in the coming days, with almost no debate, 
we should not be passing the National Defense Authorization Act, which 
provides some $900 billion for the Department of Defense--a little bit 
less than that--$895.2 billion. When spending on nuclear weapons and 
emergency defense funding is included, the United States will spend 
this year close to $1 trillion on the military--$1 trillion on the 
military, and a few blocks away from here, people are sleeping out on 
the streets.
  While middle-class and working-class families are struggling to 
survive, we supposedly just don't have the financial resources to help 
them. We just cannot afford to build more housing. We just cannot 
afford to provide quality childcare to our kids or to support public 
education or to provide healthcare to all. We just can't afford to do 
that. But when the military-industrial complex and all of their well-
paid lobbyists come marching into Capitol Hill, somehow or other, there 
is more than enough money for Congress to provide them with virtually 
everything they need. The military-industrial complex speaks, and 
Congress responds.
  Of that nearly $1 trillion that will be voted on in the next few 
days, about half will go to a handful of hugely profitable defense 
contractors. The Pentagon accounts for about two-thirds of all Federal 
contracting, obligating more money every year than all civilian Federal 
Agencies combined--combined. Yet the Pentagon remains the only major 
Federal Agency that cannot pass an independent audit.
  The Department of Defense still cannot accurately account for their 
finances more than 30 years after Congress made it a requirement under 
Federal law. In the most recent failed audit attempt, the Department of 
Defense still could not fully account for huge portions of its more 
than $4 trillion in assets. The GAO--the Government Accountability 
Office--reports that the Defense Department cannot accurately post 
transactions to the correct accounts each year. Auditors find billions 
of dollars the Pentagon didn't even know it had. In fiscal year 2022, 
Navy auditors found $4.4 billion in untracked inventory. They just lost 
it. Hey, what is $4 billion among friends when you have $1 trillion to 
play with?
  I don't often agree with Elon Musk. I agree with him very, very 
rarely. But he is right when he says the Pentagon ``has little idea how 
its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent.'' That is Musk.
  The inability to track taxpayer dollars has allowed, within the 
Defense Department, massive fraud, massive amounts of waste, and 
unbelievable amounts of cost overruns. Defense contractors routinely 
overcharge the Pentagon by 40 percent and sometimes much higher than 
that.
  For example, just one example, in October, a few months ago, RTX--
formerly Raytheon--was fined $950 million for inflating bills to the 
Department of Defense as they lied about labor and material costs and 
as they paid bribes to secure foreign business. They were fined $950 
million.
  In June, Lockheed Martin was fined $70 million for overcharging the 
Navy for aircraft parts--the latest in a long line of similar abuses.
  The F-35--the most expensive weapon system in history--has run up 
hundreds of billions of dollars in cost overruns. GAO now estimates 
that it will cost more than $2 trillion to develop, maintain, and 
operate this fighter jet through its lifetime.
  Today, as a result of massive consolidation in the defense industry, 
a large portion of the Pentagon budget now goes to just a handful of 
huge defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, RTX--formerly Raytheon--
General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. That consolidation has been 
extremely profitable for the industry.
  Since 2022, these four contractors have brought in over 600 billion 
in revenues, including 353 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds and recorded 
57 billion in profits. During that same period, they have spent 61 
billion on dividends and stock buybacks to make their wealthy 
shareholders even wealthier. That is just four companies, over less 
than 3 years, taking 353 billion in taxpayer money and handing 61 
billion back to wealthy shareholders.
  It is worthwhile listening to what Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro 
said earlier this year to a defense industry convention. This is the 
Secretary of the Navy speaking to defense contractors:

       Many of you are making record profits, as evidenced by your 
     quarterly financial statements. . . . You can't be asking for 
     the American taxpayer to make greater public investments 
     while you continue to goose your stock prices through stock 
     buybacks . . . and other accounting maneuvers.

  That is the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and he is quite right.
  It is not only fraud and cost overruns that drive up military 
spending. The major defense contractors also provide their CEOs with 
exorbitant compensation packages. In the last 3 years for which 
information is available, the top four defense companies paid their 
CEOs more than 257 million combined. These companies are all 
significantly reliant on the U.S. taxpayer. Yet they pay their CEOs 
about 100 times more than the Secretary of Defense receives. CEOs, 
defense industry, receive more than 100 times greater compensation than 
the U.S. Secretary of Defense and 500 times more than the average newly 
enlisted servicemember.
  Now, how does that happen? How does it happen that the Defense 
Department can't pass an audit? How does it happen that every one of 
the major defense contractors ends up paying fines for fraud? How does 
it happen that we have massive cost overruns, and yet we give the 
military industrial complex pretty much what they want. And, by the 
way, there will be virtually no debate on that issue here on the floor. 
It is only a trillion dollars. Hey, what is a trillion dollars among 
friends?
  People sleeping out on the street; people can't afford healthcare; 
children going hungry; elderly people can't afford to heat their homes. 
Got a trillion bucks, no questions asked, for the military industrial 
complex.
  So how does all of this happen? And I think most Americans now know 
the answer. It ain't complicated. These companies--just like the drug 
companies, just like the insurance companies, just like Wall Street and 
the big banks, just like the fossil fuel industry--they spend millions 
and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying. In the 
recent election cycle, the one we just came through, defense 
contractors spent nearly $251 million on lobbying and contributed 
almost 37 million to political candidates.
  And surprise, surprise, aren't we all shocked that they end up 
getting what they want with almost no debate?
  The waste and fraud in the defense industry is not just, 
interestingly enough, costing American taxpayers huge amounts of money, 
it is also costing lives. So let me tell you what I mean by that. Take 
a look at the war in Ukraine. The United States is providing tens and 
tens of billions of dollars to help defend Ukraine from Putin's 
horrific invasion of that country.

[[Page S6965]]

  Despite their recordbreaking profits, many defense contractors said 
that they couldn't ramp up production of key weapons without more 
taxpayer support. So the U.S. Government wanted to support, with my 
vote, Ukraine against Putin's invasion. Ukraine needs weapons. And the 
defense contractors said: Hey, if you want us to help Ukraine, get them 
weapons, we need to ramp up production. We need more Federal aid.
  And so, as part of that process, Congress repeatedly appropriated 
emergency funding with roughly 78.5 billion going to buy equipment and 
services from the major defense contractors for Ukraine.
  And how did, with all of that money, these patriotic defense 
contractors respond? Did they say: ``Well, thank you. We are going to 
do everything we can, get all of the weapons we can at a reasonable 
price to Ukraine, which is fighting for its life''? Not quite.
  What the defense contractors did is jack up the prices they were 
charging us in order to help Ukraine. RTX increased prices for Stinger 
missiles from $25,000 in the 1990s to $400,000 in 2023. Even accounting 
for inflation and improvements in technology, that is an outrageous 
price increase.
  But it wasn't enough for RTX. A recent NATO contract reveals RTX is 
now charging approximately $745,000 per Stinger. Lockheed Martin and 
RTX raised the price of the Javelin missile system from about 263,000 
per unit just before the war to 350,000 this year.
  The United States has provided more than 10,000 Javelins to Ukraine. 
Similar price hikes took place for Patriot missiles and other weapons 
systems.
  And make no mistake, every time a contractor pads its profit margins, 
fewer weapons reach the frontlines. The greed of these defense 
contractors is not just costing American taxpayers huge amounts of 
money, it is killing Ukrainians. They are getting less weapons than 
they should, given the amount of money that we are spending.
  And there is a name for all of this. It is called war profiteering, 
and this is not a new problem. During World War II, then-U.S. Senator 
from Missouri Harry Truman was shocked by the profits made by military 
contractors while American boys were getting killed in Europe and in 
the east. And he appointed a special commission--it is called the 
Truman Commission--to investigate war profiteering, and they found 
massive amounts of fraud.
  In my view, that is exactly what we should be doing now. We should be 
instituting a Truman Commission, or call it whatever you want, to take 
a hard look at the prices that the defense industry is charging us for 
the weapons they provide.
  We should also consider other ideas to reduce waste and fraud in the 
military industrial complex, such as wider use of the Defense 
Production Act, significant penalties for audit failures, and a 
windfall profit tax on hugely profitable defense companies.
  Most Americans would agree that we need a strong military, and I 
agree that we need a strong military. But we do not need a defense 
system that is designed to make huge profits for a handful of giant 
defense contractors while providing less of what the military needs. We 
do not need to spend almost a trillion dollars on the military while 
half a million Americans are homeless, while children go hungry, and 
while elderly people have difficulty heating their homes.
  Let me conclude by saying something, which I think is one of the more 
profound statements ever made by a President, and that is that Dwight 
D. Eisenhower, who was a former five-star general and a Republican 
President from 1952 to 1960--he warned us about everything that I am 
talking about in his farewell address in 1961, and it would be very 
wise for us to remember what President Eisenhower said, and this is the 
quote. I quote President Eisenhower:

       In the councils of government, we must guard against the 
     acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or 
     unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential 
     for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will 
     persist.

  What Eisenhower said was true in 1961. It is even more true today.
  I intend to vote against this inflated military budget.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.

            Ending Improper Payments to Deceased People Act

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with me today are two of my colleagues 
from my Senate office, Mr. John Lowery and Mr. Jackson Bewley. I am 
grateful for their good judgment, counsel, and advice.
  I am delighted to see so many Members of Congress--and I mean this 
sincerely--so many Members of Congress embrace the call for a less 
wasteful Federal Government, for a more efficient Federal Government. 
We spend a little over $6 trillion a year, as Senator Sanders so 
eloquently pointed out. When you spend $6 trillion a year, somebody is 
getting $6 trillion a year.
  Every penny in our budget has a constituency, and that constituency 
will fight us. They will fight us. And I recognize that, and it is 
something that as we go about downsizing government, we have to be 
mindful of. However, there is one constituency that is not going to be 
able to fight us in our quest to scrutinize Federal spending, and I am 
referring to dead people, and that is what I want to talk about today. 
I want to talk about dead people and the fact that they are getting 
money from the Federal Government.
  In fiscal year 2023 alone--this is just 1 year--our government sent 
$1.3 billion--not $1.3 million--we sent $1.3 billion in checks to dead 
people. Those aren't my numbers. Those numbers come from the Office of 
Management and Budget. That is just 1 year.
  Not only is the Federal Government sending checks to dead people, 
those checks are being cashed. Now, I have heard of dead people voting, 
but cashing the checks? You don't have to be God's perfect idiot to 
realize that there is fraud happening with respect to all this money.
  Here is how this problem arises. When you die in America, your name 
is sent to the vital records office in your State. And at that point, 
the Social Security Administration pays each State to give an ongoing 
list of deceased Americans in that State. So far, so good.
  The Social Security Administration takes this down, this list of 
deceased people, and they compile on an ongoing basis a list called the 
Death Master File. The Death Master File. That is just a list of 
everybody, updated daily, of people in the United States who are 
deceased.
  Why does the Social Security Administration do this? Well, so the 
SSA, the Social Security Administration, can stop sending people who 
have died checks. So far, so good.
  There is just one problem. I discovered this about 7 years ago. The 
Social Security Administration refuses to share that list with anybody 
else in the Federal Government. They won't share it with any other 
Federal Agencies, many of which send out checks.
  The Department of the Treasury, for example, sends out checks. SSA 
won't share the information with them. The Small Business 
Administration sends out a lot of checks. The Social Security 
Administration has a list of all deceased Americans, but SSA will not 
share that information with the SBA.
  I will give you some examples. You remember when we were in the 
coronavirus crisis, and we had an economic meltdown. We sent stimulus 
checks to Americans to try to keep the economy on its feet. We paid 
$1.4 billion to dead people, and they cashed the checks.
  The Paycheck Protection Program, which was a part of our stimulus 
program, paid out $38 million in loans to dead people. These were 
people who were using--live people, obviously--who were using dead 
people's Social Security numbers to collect payments.
  The COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans fund--another culprit--
was involved in sending checks to dead people.
  The Department of Veterans Affairs--and I am not blaming them. In 
many respects, it is not their fault. A couple of years ago, a scam 
artist stole the Social Security number of a deceased person--a 
deceased veteran--and received about $825,000 in checks from 1997 to 
2024.
  Now, the person committing this fraud was just quietly accepting the 
checks. Somehow, the Department of Veterans Affairs, for some reason, 
stopped sending that person the checks. So the fraudster just picked up 
the phone and called the Department of

[[Page S6966]]

Veterans Affairs, impersonated the dead person, and convinced them to 
start sending the checks again.
  Again, it was not necessarily the fault of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. The VA didn't know that the Social Security number belonged to 
a deceased person.
  Another example: A person in Ohio was able to collect her deceased 
mother's Veterans Affairs benefits for 48 years--48 years. Of course, 
she was caught.
  The truth is, it is sort of like being asked: You didn't go fishing 
on Saturday; how many fish do you think you didn't catch?
  We don't know how much money we are sending out every year to dead 
people.
  Let me give you an example of how screwed up the data is. This is a 
strong indicator of what is wrong.
  The Social Security Administration, if you asked them, will tell you 
that there are, according to their records, 6.5 million Americans 
living today in America who are 112 years of age or older. They say 
there are 6.5 million Americans who are at least 112 years old or 
older.
  Now, I don't know about you, but I don't know anybody who is 112 
years old. And I checked. At any given time, there are about 40 people 
on an ongoing basis in the world who are fortunate enough to live to be 
112. The data is so screwed up. According to SSA, 6.5 million people 
are 112 years old.
  A number of years ago--7 years ago--I started working with Senator 
Tom Carper, a fine American if there ever was one. I started working 
with Tom on this issue. I went to Social Security, and I said: Look, 
this problem is easily solved. Just share the Death Master File with 
other Agencies and especially share it with the Department of the 
Treasury.
  I don't want to confuse anyone, but the Department of the Treasury 
has a ``Do Not Pay'' list of people who aren't supposed to receive 
checks for a variety of reasons that other Agencies consult. But I said 
to my friends at Social Security: Why don't you just give the Death 
Master File to other Agencies?
  They said: We can't. It is illegal. The way we construe our enabling 
statutes, we don't have the authority.
  Well, I said, OK, I am not going to argue with them; we will just go 
pass a law. It was harder than I thought. But we did. In 2020, Senator 
Carper and I passed a bill. The bill was called Stopping Improper 
Payments to Deceased People Act, and it gave the Social Security 
Administration permission and, indeed, directed the Social Security 
Administration to start sharing its list of dead people with other 
Agencies in the Federal Government.
  I don't want to get down in the weeds, but--believe it or not--we had 
people oppose the legislation, and many people within the Federal 
Government. So in order to get our bill passed, we had to compromise. 
We had to agree to only implement this requirement that Social Security 
share the list of dead people with everybody else--we could only get 
them to agree to do it for 3 years, in a trial program.
  This clock started ticking on our 3-year period in December of 2023. 
So, obviously, 3 years is right upon us. And if we don't make this 
program permanent, it is going to expire in 2026.
  So Senator Carper and I have introduced another bill. It does 
basically the same thing as the 2020 bill, but it makes the program 
permanent. This new bill is called Ending Improper Payments to Deceased 
People Act, and we need to pass it.
  There has been a lot of squabbling back and forth. I don't want to do 
anything to step on too many toes to jeopardize my bill, about how much 
the States are going to be paid and who is going to pay Social Security 
for sharing their dead persons list with the rest of the government. I 
think we have a lot of it worked out. But we need to go pass this bill.
  I mean, this makes no sense whatsoever. I can understand if we talk 
about changing the Medicaid Program, for example--what is fair, what is 
unfair. I can understand debating that, and I can understand reasonable 
people disagreeing over what changes, if any, we ought to make to the 
Medicaid Program. I get it.
  I just listened to Senator Sanders, once again, speak very eloquently 
about the waste at the Department of Defense. That is something that 
reasonable people, all of whom agree that we ought to have a strong 
defense--but reasonable people--can disagree over how to achieve that.
  But, my God, you don't have to be Euclid to figure out that this is 
just fraud. It is abuse. It is low-hanging fruit, and it is so easily 
solved. All we have to do is direct the Social Security Administration, 
on a permanent basis--not a 3-year trial basis, on a permanent basis--
to start sharing the list of dead people with the Department of the 
Treasury and everybody else in the Federal Government who wants it. And 
then everybody is on the same page, and we know who is deceased. And we 
can stop sending the money to dead people who cash the checks.
  Now, I am talking about this now--I have talked about it before on 
the floor. I am not going to try to pass the bill this year. I am not. 
We are running up against a clock, and we have the NDAA. We have a CR 
to pass, and we have to keep government open. We have to renew the 
flood insurance program. And you know all that. But I am going to be 
back. I am like ``The Terminator.'' I will be back as soon as the new 
Congress is sworn in.
  Many of my colleagues have said to me: You know, it is time we stop 
talking about who needs to pay more in taxes and start talking about 
and asking the question with respect to ``What the hell happened to the 
money?'' And I agree with that. I can't think of an easier place to 
start.
  Let's just pass this simple bill. Let's stop sending money to dead 
people. Again, we can debate about the wisdom of dead people voting. We 
all know it happens. But cashing checks is a bridge too far.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hassan). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.








[Pages S6966-S6967]
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]



           Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 8413 and H.R. 8219

  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I come before you today to discuss a 
grave situation that is unfolding in the southwestern part of my State.
  Two Nebraska communities--one at Swanson Reservoir and the other at 
Red Willow--are at risk. Over the past 50 years, residents of these two 
communities have built friendships. They have started and supported 
businesses, and they have enjoyed the recreation that the local area 
offers. But in just 2 months, these Nebraskans will be forced to leave. 
They will be forced out of their homes over a disagreement between the 
Federal Government and local stakeholders on how the land should be 
managed.
  The good news is, there is a simple solution to this problem. In 
working with the rest of the Nebraska delegation as well as the Bureau 
of Reclamation, I have introduced legislation that benefits all 
parties. It transfers the ownership of this land from the Federal 
Government to local officials.
  I want to thank Congressman Adrian Smith, especially, for introducing 
companion legislation in the House.
  Once the counties control the land around these reservoirs, the 
residents of Red Willow and Swanson can work with local authorities to 
chart a better path forward--one that preserves the communities and one 
that also improves the recreation areas.
  Since I introduced this bill, I have heard from over 1,000 Nebraskans 
about how urgently they need this land transferred. I have received 
numerous letters of support from local communities and businesses. 
Everyone--everyone--involved supports this bill. The residents and 
their local government officials support this bill. Our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle have offered no objection to this bill. The 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources passed this bill on a voice 
vote. We also worked with the Bureau of Reclamation on this solution. 
Everyone--everyone--agrees that my bill offers the best future for the 
hundreds of Nebraskans who call these areas home. It is time to do what 
is right and to save these communities.
  I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.

[[Page S6967]]

  

  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, today, I rise in support of H.R. 8219, 
the Lahaina National Heritage Study Act. I also want to lend my support 
to the bill that is proposed by my esteemed colleague from Nebraska.
  H.R. 8219 requires the Secretary of the Interior to study the 
potential of Lahaina to be designated as a National Heritage Area. The 
August 2023 wildfires brought to the forefront how special Lahaina is 
to Maui, to Hawaii, to our country, and, indeed, the world. The 
National Heritage Area designation could bring important Federal 
resources to help protect and manage the historic natural and cultural 
resources that are unique to Lahaina.
  I thank Senator Fischer for her partnership in supporting this 
measure, and I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill today 
so that the President can sign it into law, and the National Park 
Service can begin working with local partners on this effort.
  I just want to mention that it is very clear that both Senator 
Fischer and I have worked very closely with our communities in 
garnering support for these two bills, and no one is raising any 
substantive objections to these measures. So as we rush to finish the 
work of the Senate, I think it would be a very positive decision on our 
part to support these bills that nobody substantively objects to. So I 
hope that we can UC these bills.
  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate en bloc consideration of H.R. 8413 and 
H.R. 8219, which were received from the House. I further ask that the 
bills be considered read the third time and passed and that the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from West Virginia.
  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, in reserving the right to object, I 
have no substantive concerns with these bills. However, we have dozens 
and dozens of other bills that have been reported out of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee. Senator Barrasso and I have been very 
clear about our intentions to put together and pass a public lands 
bill, which consists of about 150 bills. All of these reported bills 
have gone through the same process in a weighted package. These two 
bills would be part of that. This week is our last chance to reach 
agreement on and to finalize that package.
  I cannot, in good conscience, start deconstructing this package that 
so many of our colleagues have worked so hard on for so long and have 
waited for today while we are continuing to negotiate on it. We have 
just finished large meetings, and we will continue the meetings 
throughout tonight and tomorrow.
  So, for now, I have to preserve the option to get a package agreed 
to, and I object to both Senators' unanimous consent requests.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Hawaii.
  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I would just like to note that I 
certainly recognize that the esteemed chair of the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources is working very hard to put together a bill that 
contains dozens of these kinds of bills that have been worked through 
the committee as well as by the proponents. However, the reality of 
time is that there are serious concerns as to whether or not we are 
going to be able to get the kind of agreement that the chairman seeks.
  Therefore, here we are with the actual two bills. And, believe me, if 
all of the other people who have similar kinds of legislation come to 
this floor and ask for unanimous consent, I will be happy to give it. 
That is all we are asking at this point--that these two bills are ripe 
today. Whether or not the chair is able to succeed in putting together 
this massive legislation that he referred to, I think, is very 
problematic, and I think we should, at least, take positive action on 
the bills that the Senator from Nebraska and I have worked very hard 
on.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, this really is outrageous. My 
legislation cannot wait. As I have said, it passed the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources on a voice vote. Last week, it passed the 
full House of Representatives unanimously.
  The bill is different from the rest of the package that my colleagues 
are negotiating. Nebraskans are watching this bill--they are watching 
my bill--because Nebraskans will be kicked off their land starting in 
February--2 months from now--if it is not signed into law.
  I have been working with the chair. I have been working with his team 
for over a year--over a year--on this legislation, incorporating 
feedback from them and continuously emphasizing the urgency with my 
legislation. None of my colleagues are objecting to policy in this 
bill. They know it is the right thing to do. In fact, my colleague 
objecting has already voted in favor of the bill in committee. Rather, 
objecting to this legislation is choosing to use these people, their 
homes, and these reservoirs and the small businesses as political 
leverage for unrelated matters.
  I have heard from over 1,000 constituents who are in support of this 
legislation. They know that it will chart a better path forward for 
that local community and the Federal Government. They did not ask to be 
used as political leverage.
  I hope my colleague will reconsider his objection. Otherwise, I will 
continue coming to this floor, day after day this week, asking for 
unanimous consent; although, I have been told by our cloakroom that 
there is no time available tomorrow for any action like this on the 
floor. It needs to happen now.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.

                         TRIBUTE TO KATE KAUFER

  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Kate Kaufer, 
who is retiring after serving on the Senate Appropriations Committee 
for 20 years and who has left her fingerprints on so much of the 
crucial legislation to keep our country safe and improve the lives of 
our servicemembers and their families.
  Kate Kaufer first started on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee 
in December 2004 when Senator Stevens was chair and served under Chairs 
Inouye, Cochran, Durbin, Shelby, and Tester. Colleagues from each era 
can attest she has always been an invaluable member of the team--so 
valuable in fact, that, in March 2022, she was asked to take over as 
clerk of the subcommittee.
  Through times of immense global change, instability, and uncertainty, 
when the investments we make in our military have had huge 
implications--not just for families today and not just for our own 
country, but for the world--Kate Kaufer has worked tirelessly to help 
the Senate solve problems, address threats, and ensure Congress makes 
critical strategic investments in our servicemembers and our national 
security.
  It is impossible to sum up two decades of Kate's leadership and smart 
analysis on the subcommittee. When Kate started in the Senate, 
individual appropriations bill were routinely debated and passed on the 
Senate floor. More recently, much of that work is done off the Senate 
floor, and she has remained steadfast in her loyalty to the 
deliberative processes of this body and tirelessly advocating for the 
well-being of our troops and the security of this country.
  Over her 20 years of service, Kate handled almost every single 
appropriations account and military service. Those include several 
classified accomplishments for which there is no public record. But 
publicly, from firsthand experience, I can say that she was 
instrumental in providing for our men and

[[Page S6968]]

women in uniform and their families, protecting our national security 
workforce, and preserving the national security investments over the 
last several years.
  We all owe Kate Kaufer a debt of gratitude for working through many 
long nights and hard negotiations in service of our Nation. As 
Appropriations chair this Congress, I have leaned on Kate's expertise 
and counsel; and it is clear to all that her expertise, dedication, and 
ability to work across the aisle to make progress have made our country 
stronger. She will be deeply missed.
  On behalf of all the past chairs--and all the Senators and staff--who 
have worked with Kate over the years and who know firsthand just how 
important her counsel has been, I would like to thank you, Kate, for 
your service. You will be missed, and we wish you all the best for what 
lies ahead. Thank you.

                          ____________________

                         TRIBUTE TO WADE PALMER

<bullet> Mr. DAINES. Madam President, today I have the distinct honor 
of recognizing Montana Highway Patrol State Trooper Wade Palmer of 
Ravalli County as Montanan of the Month for his bravery and sacrifice 
made in the line of duty.
  Trooper Palmer's dedication to his fellow Montanans is nothing short 
of remarkable. Born and raised in Missoula, Wade grew up in a large 
family with a passion for helping others. From a young age, he felt a 
call to law enforcement, driven by the desire to serve and protect his 
community. Over the course of his career with the Montana Highway 
Patrol, Wade displayed unwavering bravery and commitment, earning 
numerous accolades, including two Medals of Valor, the VFW Trooper of 
the Year award, and the Governor's Award for Excellence in Performance.
  Sadly, on March 15, 2019, Wade was ambushed and critically injured in 
the line of duty. Ever since that horrific event, Wade remains focused 
on his family--his wife Lindsey and their daughters Mia and Cierra--as 
he continues on his journey to recovery. Despite the hardships he has 
faced and wounds he bears, both visible and invisible, Wade's 
resilience and determination inspire us all. The countless men and 
women who serve on the frontlines each day to serve and protect are the 
best among us, and they deserve our thanks. May we always remain 
committed to supporting and honoring our first responders.
  It is my distinct honor to recognize Wade Palmer for his selfless 
service to the Treasure State. May God bestow blessings upon you and 
your family as you continue healing. You make Montana proud.<bullet>

                                 PEPFAR

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, early this month, we commemorated World 
AIDS Day, and so I come to the floor today to speak about the need for 
America to stay the course in the fight to end HIV/AIDS.
  Two decades ago--when the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR) was established under George W. Bush--an HIV/AIDS diagnosis 
was a death sentence in many parts of the world. Today, the possibility 
of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic is no longer a dream; it is a realistic 
prospect. And it should not be a partisan issue.
  Let's remember that it was President Trump who signed the PEPFAR 
Extension Act of 2018. We need to set aside the manufactured 
allegations motivated by hyper-partisanship that have prevented the 
PEPFAR reauthorization and look at the facts.
  First of all, PEPFAR is not only the most successful global health 
program; it is arguably the most successful foreign aid program since 
the Marshall Plan. It has earned the United States an enormous amount 
of goodwill around the world and distinguishes us from our strategic 
competitors. We launched this billion-dollar program because it was the 
right thing to do, not because we expected a quid pro quo.
  Our adversaries have never engaged a program of such enormity and 
what little they do comes with strings attached. I would argue PEPFAR 
is one of the most effective soft power tools we have. So it is no 
wonder that countries around the world are looking to the U.S. for 
leadership in ending the deadly epidemic for once and for all.
  Look at the numbers. Over the past 20 years, PEPFAR has saved 25 
million people. Thanks to PEPFAR, more than 5 million children have 
been born HIV-free. PEPFAR also helps kids who are orphans because one 
or both of their parents died from AIDS. It includes family-centered 
programming, nutritional support, access to education.
  At the beginning of 2024, PEPFAR launched a 2-year initiative titled 
``Safe Births, Healthy Babies.'' The goal is to eliminate mother-to-
child transmission and improve maternal and neonatal healthcare in 
Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Within these three countries alone, 
PEPFAR is reaching over 200,000 pregnant women living with HIV, and 
potentially averting 7,000 new infant HIV infections.
  These are the facts. And the incredible thing is, we may be on the 
verge of a further breakthrough.
  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 
found that twice-yearly injections of lenacapavir--a drug used to treat 
HIV/AIDS--was 100 percent effective in preventing AIDS transmission in 
women--100 percent.
  There is more work to be done to understand the long-term results. 
But we may be on the verge of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic as we know 
it over the course of the coming Trump administration.
  Now, even if we passed PEPFAR today, we still have work to do. 
According to the Global Fund, in 2023, 210,000 new infections were 
estimated among girls and young women.
  In Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS among girls and young women is three 
times higher than boys and young men. In 2023, 44 percent of all new 
infections were among girls and women of all ages. These disturbing 
trends are the result of discrimination and violence preventing access 
to lifesaving care for girls and young women. UNAIDS reports that an 
estimated 1.3 million people became infected with HIV in 2023 alone.
  Let me talk about one of the biggest problems we are facing: We have 
lately been reauthorizing this program on a year-to-year basis. This is 
undermining our progress and threatening our future. A year-to-year 
reauthorization sends the message to partner governments that HIV/AIDS 
is no longer a priority. This will impact not just HIV/AIDS prevention 
but overall health structures that grew out of vital HIV/AIDS programs.
  We need a 5-year reauthorization. A 5-year reauthorization makes all 
the difference if we want to end the HIV/AIDS threat by 2030. Five 
years allows organizations implementing PEPFAR to plan their activities 
with predictable timelines. It allows more efficient procurement of 
commodities and supplies. It helps retain medical staff and assure 
clients that they will be able to obtain continuous care. Without a 5-
year reauthorization, there are no guarantees. Without a 5-year 
reauthorization, we will be putting millions at risk of new HIV/AIDS 
infections and death.
  I know that for many Americans, the HIV/AIDS epidemic can seem far 
away. But let me end with this warning: This summer, a UN report found 
that for the first time, more than half of new HIV infections occurred 
outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. Preventing this spread isn't just the 
right thing to do, it isn't just the moral thing to do, it is in 
America's national security interest to do this.
  And so, to my colleagues here in Congress, I urge you to support a 5-
year reauthorization of the PEPFAR program. Let's end the scourge of 
HIV/AIDS once and for all.

                          ____________________

          75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREENBRIAR CHILDREN'S CENTER

<bullet> Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, I rise to celebrate the 75th 
anniversary of Greenbriar Children's Center in Savannah.
  Founded in 1949, Greenbriar Children's Center was established by 
members of the Gamma Sigma Omega chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha 
Sorority, Inc., to start an orphanage for Black children in the 
Savannah area.

[[Page S6969]]

  When the orphanage was founded, Black children who were homeless or 
without parental support were often placed in local work farms and 
penal institutions.
  Today, Greenbriar serves children and families of all backgrounds and 
ethnicities, through childcare, early learning programs, family 
preservation and counseling services, and an emergency shelter for 
children and young adults.
  As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend the faculty, staff, and families 
at Greenbriar for their 75 years of service and for their work to help 
our kids learn, grow, and thrive.<bullet>

     REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13818 OF DECEMBER 20, 2017, WITH 
      RESPECT TO SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE AND CORRUPTION--PM 63

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 
of December 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond December 20, 
2024.
  The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption that 
have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United 
States, continue to threaten the stability of international political 
and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the 
values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and 
functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken 
democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent 
conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; undermine 
economic markets; and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to 
serious human rights abuse and corruption.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, December 11, 2024.

          100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC HARRINGTON SCHOOL

<bullet> Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, I rise to celebrate the Historic 
Harrington School, on St. Simons Island, GA, as we commemorate its 
100th anniversary this year.
  Formerly known as the Harrington Graded School, the Historic 
Harrington School functioned as the principal educational facility for 
three African-American communities on St. Simons Island until school 
consolidation in the 1960s, when students were either bused to the 
mainland in Brunswick, GA, or were sent to private schools for African-
Americans in other parts of the State, such as Augusta and Cordele.
  The Harrington community was settled by formerly enslaved families 
who had worked on the plantations of Georgia's barrier islands. Census 
data from 1900, 1910, and 1920 revealed an African-American community 
of sawmill workers and carpenters who, in 1924, built the one-room 
schoolhouse for the education of their children and grandchildren.
  In the 1990s, pressure by developers caused many African-American 
homes and properties in the Harrington community to be sold and 
subdivided. Residents who did not want to sell their heritage put up 
yellow ``Don't Ask/Won't Sell'' signs in their yards.
  In 2004, Ms. Isadora Hunter, who attended the school in 1928, donated 
her portion of family land to the St. Simon's Land Trust and Glynn 
County, so that the school would be preserved. That same year, Glynn 
County and the St. Simons Land Trust, Inc., acquired ownership of a 12-
acre tract next to the schoolhouse that became a public park.
  In 2011, the Historic Harrington School was selected as one of ten 
``Places in Peril'' by the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, 
identifying the schoolhouse as a significant historic site threatened 
by deterioration. In 2017, through the grassroots activism of the 
Friends of Harrington School Inc., the St. Simons African American 
Heritage Coalition, and members of the local community, funds were 
raised for the schoolhouse to be completely restored, and the school 
officially reopened with a ribbon cutting in August of that year. The 
Harrington tract, acquired by the land trust and the county pursuant to 
the Georgia Greenspace laws and the Glynn County Greenspace Program, 
opened as the Harrington Park and is maintained by the county.
  Today, the Historic Harrington School is a cultural center where 
residents and tourists learn about the Gullah Geechee heritage of St. 
Simons Island and coastal Georgia.
  As Georgia's U.S Senator, I join the St. Simons Island community and 
all Georgians in celebrating this momentous 100th anniversary and 
important heritage of the Historic Harrington School.<bullet>

     REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 14059 OF DECEMBER 15, 2021, WITH 
           RESPECT TO GLOBAL ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING--PM 64

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to global illicit drug 
trafficking declared in Executive Order 14059 of December 15, 2021, is 
to continue in effect beyond December 15, 2024.
  The trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including 
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the deaths of tens of 
thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal 
overdoses with their own tragic human toll. Drug cartels, transnational 
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources 
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid 
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. 
International drug trafficking--including the illicit production, 
global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs; the rise of 
extremely potent drugs such as

[[Page S6970]]

fentanyl and other synthetic opioids; as well as the growing role of 
Internet-based drug sales--continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 14059 with respect to global illicit drug trafficking.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

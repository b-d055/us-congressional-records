counties for nearly four decades.
  During his time in office, higher education was a top priority for 
Representative Pelowski, championing a number of pieces of legislation 
for the expansion of Winona State University.
  Representative Pelowski has done an exemplary job representing the 
people of 26A, and it was a true honor to have previously served 
alongside him in the Minnesota State Legislature.
  I am grateful for Representative Pelowski's years of dedicated public 
service, and I wish him the warmest congratulations on his retirement.

             HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF KELLY McCLEARY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BILL FOSTER

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
extraordinary contributions of Kelly McCleary, a beloved educator, 
community advocate, and mentor from Aurora, Illinois, who recently 
passed away. Kelly's unwavering dedication to her family, students, and 
community has left a lasting impact that will be felt for generations.
  Born on December 30, 1961, in Augusta, Georgia, Kelly graduated from 
East Aurora High School in 1980. She earned a bachelor's degree in 
physical education from North Central College in 1985 and a master's 
degree in educational leadership from Aurora University. Kelly married 
Scott McCleary on September 5, 1987, and they had two children, Ian and 
Kara. She built a life centered on service, education, and community 
betterment.
  Kelly's career in education was marked by a deep commitment to 
nurturing the growth and development of young people. She taught 
elementary physical education, coached track, and served as an 
assistant principal and principal in the East Aurora School District. 
In recognition of her exceptional leadership and dedication, she was 
named the Kane County School Administrator of the Year in 2006. Later, 
Kelly continued her work in education as a teacher and director of 
Wesley Preschool in Aurora, where she continued to inspire and shape 
the lives of young learners.
  Outside of the classroom, Kelly's influence extended into the wider 
community through her service in both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, 
serving as a den, pack, and troop leader, and leading numerous district 
and council activities. Her contributions were recognized with awards, 
including the Girl Scout Gold Award, the Thank Badge II, and the Hall 
of Fame Award. From the Boy Scouts, she was awarded the District Award 
of Merit and the Silver Beaver Award--both testaments to her dedication 
and leadership.
  Kelly's commitment to her community was further exemplified through 
her involvement in organizations, including the Aurora Public Library 
District Foundation's annual gala. She was a champion for causes that 
enriched the lives of those around her, particularly children.
  In her personal time, Kelly enjoyed traveling with her friends and 
family, especially to Disney World, and creating beautiful quilts. Her 
love for these activities was only surpassed by her passion for 
enriching the lives of others.
  Kelly McCleary touched the lives of countless individuals throughout 
her life, leaving behind a legacy of compassion, leadership, and 
service. She was a tireless advocate for children, a devoted educator, 
a loving mother, and a cherished member of the Aurora community. She 
will be remembered fondly for her remarkable ability to inspire, her 
selfless contributions, and the profound impact she had on the lives of 
so many.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Aurora and grateful for Kelly 
McCleary's service to her community. Her legacy of kindness, service, 
and dedication will live on in the hearts of those who knew her. I 
extend my heartfelt condolences to her family and invite my colleagues 
to join me in celebrating her extraordinary life.

  RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WOMEN VETERANS OF SOUTHWEST 
                  MISSOURI, AMERICAN LEGION POST 1214

                                 ______

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate American 
Legion Post 1214 located in Springfield, Missouri, on the 10-year 
anniversary of the organization's charter for Women Veterans of 
Southwest Missouri.
  The post has grown from 12 initial Legionnaires to 97 Legionnaires 
thanks to the outreach and recruitment skills of a number of women 
including Adjutant Shellie Jones, Treasurer Nancy Fazzino, past 
Commander Louise Hansen, current Commander Jennifer Tyes and a host of 
other dedicated women. Ninety percent of the post's membership are 
women who have active duty service in one of the Nation's four military 
branches, while ten percent are men who also have served our country 
and been honorably discharged.
  The post works to foster community building, and to provide outreach 
and support for fellow veterans by supporting programs such as Quilts 
of Valor, Harmony House Domestic Violence Shelter, Honor Flight of the 
Ozarks, and the United Way of the Ozarks' Veteran's Emergency Aid 
Program. The post also supports Junior ROTC programs at four area high 
schools: Willard, Hillcrest, Greenwood Laboratory and New Covenant 
Academy. The post also has sponsored some 56 candidates for Boys State 
and Girls State over the last 10 years. It also engages with the public 
and several local veterans organizations for Wreaths Across America, 
where they place holiday wreaths at each of the headstones in the 
national and state cemeteries in Springfield.

[[Page E1226]]

These are just a few of their many service projects.
  American Legion Post 1214 is an asset to Southwest Missouri, and I am 
grateful for their selfless service and tireless dedication to 
improving the lives of veterans of every era, as well as inspiring the 
next generation of military service members. Please join me in 
congratulating them for their 10 years of service.

                          ____________________

  HONORING THE SERVICE OF MINNESOTA STATE REPRESENTATIVE PAT GAROFALO

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
Minnesota House Representative Pat Garofalo. First elected in 2004, 
Representative Garofalo has honorably served in the Minnesota 
Legislature for the past twenty years.
  During his time in office, Representative Garofalo exhibited a 
profound willingness to serve his fellow southern Minnesotans, not only 
as their voice in the House Chamber, but also by his leadership on 
numerous House committees throughout the years. In 2008, Representative 
Garofalo was elected to the position of assistant majority whip for the 
legislative session, and later became chairman of the Education Finance 
Committee, as well as the Job Growth & Energy Affordability Committee.
  Representative Garofalo has done an exemplary job representing his 
constituents in Dakota, Goodhue, and Rice counties for the past two 
decades, and I consider it a true honor to have previously served 
alongside him in the Minnesota State Legislature.
  I am grateful for Representative Garofalo's years of dedicated public 
service to southern Minnesota, and I wish him the warmest 
congratulations on his retirement.

             RECOGNIZING THE 70TH BIRTHDAY OF GERALD MORRIS

                                 ______

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House's attention 
today to recognize the 70th birthday of Gerald Morris. Gerald was born 
to Emma Lois and Toby Lee Morris on December 4, 1954, in Anniston, 
Alabama. He is one of six children. He graduated from Saks High School 
in 1972.
  On February 22, 1985, Gerald married Waltina Morris. They were 
blessed with five children and seven grandchildren.
  Gerald was inspired by his uncle, Edgar Morris, who was a tailor. He 
had his shop in downtown Anniston. Gerald worked at a men's clothing 
store named Phil's Men's Store and began doing alterations for 
customers there. He attended trade school and opened his own shop in 
downtown Anniston named Morris Alterations in 1981. As life would have 
it, his son was able to open a men's clothing store right across the 
street from his own storefront. Two of Gerald's daughters work 
alongside him daily.
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Morris switched gears at the shop 
and began making a variety of popular masks that sold from Alabama to 
Connecticut. After the pandemic, work was busier than ever as people 
went back to their social engagements, proms and weddings, they needed 
his artful craft to make their clothing perfect for them.
  Gerald has been in business for almost 44 years and attributes his 
success to all of his hard work and loyal customers. He has no plans of 
retiring. Gerald and his store are a fixture of downtown Anniston and 
Gerald gives back to his community by helping local schools.
  The Morris family attends New Jerusalem AFM Church of God.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Gerald on this milestone 
and wishing him a very happy birthday.

            IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE HONORABLE GERALD E. LOEHR

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 
Honorable Gerald E. Loehr, a public servant who served with distinction 
and dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice.
  Hon. Gerald E. Loehr was born into a Yonkers family with a 
longstanding tradition of politics and public service on May 19, 1943. 
His great-grandfather, John J. Loehr, served as a Yonkers Alderman 
(Councilman); his grandfather, Joseph F. Loehr, was the Mayor of 
Yonkers from 1932 to 1939; his mother, Gertrude Sweetman, was a civil 
servant; and his father, John F. Loehr, was an attorney and an 
Administrative Law Judge. With passion and principle, he proudly 
followed the family tradition.
  He graduated from Manhattan College in 1965 and Fordham Law School in 
1969. He began his distinguished career as a New York City Assistant 
District Attorney under the legendary Frank Hogan from 1969 to 1973. He 
then moved into private practice at the firm of Nobile and Magarian 
from 1973 to 1975.
  Returning to the public sector in Yonkers, Loehr served two terms as 
the Third Ward Councilman from 1975 to 1979 and one term as Mayor from 
1979 to 1981. Upon leaving the Mayor's office, he returned to private 
practice as a founding partner of the law firm Ecker, Loehr, & Ecker, 
LLP, where he worked until 2004.
  In 2005, he was elected as Judge in the Westchester County Court. In 
2006, he was appointed as an Acting State Supreme Court Justice, and in 
2012, he was elected to serve as a State Supreme Court Justice in the 
9th Judicial District.
  Loehr was a devoted husband and father, survived by his beloved wife, 
Susan Newman Loehr, also a public servant and retired Westchester 
County Commissioner of Jurors. He is also survived by his older 
brother, John Loehr, and six children from two marriages: Peter, Janine 
(Barbanell), Melissa, Jonathan (Newman), Cariana (Bulman), and Gerald 
E., II. He also leaves behind 15 grandchildren, who will miss him 
dearly.
  Today, Yonkers, the State of New York and our Nation, have lost a 
dedicated protector of justice. It is my hope that his wife, children, 
and grandchildren can draw strength and comfort from his many 
contributions. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to a 
lifetime of service and in remembering the Honorable Gerald E. Loehr.

                          ____________________

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a special man, Freddie 
Johnson, from Frankfort, Kentucky. Mr. Johnson is well-known in the 
bourbon industry for his service as Distillery VIP Visitor Lead for 
Buffalo Trace Distillery.
  Mr. Johnson was born in Bourbon County and his family moved to 
Frankfort when he was 5 years old. His grandfather, Jimmy Johnson, Sr., 
began working at Buffalo Trace in 1912. He was there for 52 years and 
became the first African American warehouse foreman. His father, Jimmy 
Johnson, Jr., joined him at Buffalo Trace in 1936 and served as 
warehouse supervisor. Young Freddie played at Buffalo Trace as a child. 
In 2002, Johnson retired early from a job in Atlanta to return home, 
work with his father, and become the third generation of his family to 
work at Buffalo Trace.
  Mr. Johnson has become famous for providing entertaining and 
informative tours of Buffalo Trace to thousands of guests each year. 
For his contributions to the bourbon industry, he was inducted into the 
Bourbon Hall of Fame in 2018. He is a recipient of the 2015 ROSE 
(Recognition of Service Excellence) award and the 2017 Lexington 
Hospitality Award. In 2024, he was chosen to be part of the Whisky 
Magazine Hall of Fame, becoming their first Black member. The Kentucky 
Black Bourbon Guild has a scholarship named in his honor.
  Mr. Johnson has contributed greatly to the success of the bourbon 
industry, one of Kentucky's signature industries. It is my honor to 
lift up the life of this true Kentucky treasure, Mr. Freddie Johnson, 
and celebrate his iconic career at Buffalo Trace.

           RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF GENE R. MOFFITT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to announce 
the passing of Gene R. Moffitt. Gene was an individual full of 
ambition, compassion and dedication towards his community. I urge us 
all to celebrate and remember the life of this incredible community 
leader, husband, friend, father, and grandfather.
  Born in Independence, Missouri on August 6, 1941, Gene attended 
William Chrisman High School before heading to Central Missouri State 
University to continue his academic journey. Eventually, he began what

[[Page E1227]]

would become a stellar career spanning across four decades at Block & 
Company, Inc. Realtors. Starting at an entry level position as a Sales 
Associate in 1974, Gene was active in sales, leasing and development 
projects. Through the years, his expertise in the industry grew as he 
oversaw the completion of various projects in retail, office, 
commercial, and investment projects.
  As he continued to work his way up the ladder at Block & Company, 
Inc. Realtors, Gene brought along his enthusiasm, knowledge and work 
ethic to create new approaches to real estate. Most notable, Gene 
became a leader in the industry when he initiated the first new life-
style center in the region, Zona Rosa, a mixed-use retail, office, and 
industrial complex in the Greater Kansas City area. His experience was 
sought after and highly regarded among those in the industry.
  Among his many achievements, Gene played an important role in 
relocating the St. Joseph Hospital, which later became the Linwood 
Shopping Center, revitalizing an inner-city area that was facing 
decline. The finished project became a new and expanded retail 
development which led to the City of Kansas City to be designated in 
1986 as an ``All American City'' by the Citizens Forum on Self 
Government/National Municipal League and USA Today. Additionally, Gene 
worked as the Development Consultant for the Blue Parkway Town Center, 
a redevelopment project spearheaded by the Swope Parkway Health Center.
  Though Gene has passed, his legacy and impact on Kansas City will 
remain long past our mortal lifetimes. I am reminded of Mark 10:45--
``For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and 
to give his life as a ransom for many.'' Gene's life was one dedicated 
to serving others and bettering the lives of countless people. Gene is 
survived by his loving family, friends, and wife of 58 years, Pamela. 
As we celebrate and remember the decades of devoted service from Gene, 
let us be inspired by his commitment to better his community.

  HONORING THE SERVICE OF MINNESOTA STATE REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DANIELS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRAD FINSTAD

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
Minnesota House Representative Brian Daniels. First elected in 2014 to 
represent then-District 24B, Representative Daniels has served the 
people of Minnesota honorably in the State House for the past ten 
years, most recently representing District 19A.
  Representative Daniels has worked tirelessly on behalf of his 
constituents in Dodge, Goodhue, Rice, Steele, and Waseca counties, 
particularly with his leadership in championing the priorities of the 
blind and deaf communities across Minnesota.
  Throughout his time in office, Representative Daniels introduced 
numerous bills advocating for greater language access statewide; 
including legislation that would increase proficiency standards to 
teach American Sign Language, as well as legislation that would require 
elementary schools to screen for dyslexia.
  Additionally, he authored legislation to place signage on Interstate 
35, directing drivers to Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf and 
Minnesota State Academy of the Blind in Faribault, bringing awareness 
to travelers from across the country about these outstanding 
educational institutions that we are proud to have in southern 
Minnesota.
  Representative Daniels has done an exemplary job representing the 
people of District 19A, and all of us across southern Minnesota have 
been well-served by his time in office. I wish him the warmest 
congratulations on his retirement.

                          ____________________

                     MILLIE DUNN VEASEY POST OFFICE

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 4, 2024

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9580, 
to name a post office in North Carolina after Millie Dunn Veasey. As 
has been noted, she was one of the 855 women from across our country 
who would serve with the historic Women Army Corps 6888, Central Postal 
Battalion (Six Triple Eight) during World War II.
  The Six Triple Eight was the only African American Women's Army Corps 
Battalion unit deployed overseas during WWII. Their efforts to resolve 
a monumental months long backlog of millions of pieces of mail played a 
critical role in maintaining morale for those fighting in the European 
Theater.
  In England and then France, they sorted millions of pieces of mail 
while facing challenging social and war conditions. They not only 
completed their mission but did so in record time.
  Each of these women have their own individual stories but many of 
them are similar to Ms. Veasey's. A desire to serve their country. They 
didn't set out to make history but they did so anyway.
  They served their country honorably and extraordinarily. And came 
home with little fanfare or ceremony, which they did not mind. And 
many, like Ms. Veasey, continued to contribute to their communities 
after they came home.
  I am pleased that we are recognizing these women and that this story 
of service will no longer be lost to history. This postal designation 
will help ensure that Ms. Veasey's service and dedication is remembered 
in her local community.
  A few years ago, I was pleased to spearhead a successful effort in 
Congress, along with Senator Moran, to award the Six Triple Eight with 
the Congressional Gold Medal so that their service cannot only be 
appropriately acknowledged but remembered across our Nation.
  Ms. Veasey passed away at the age 100 in 2018 and was buried in 
Raleigh National Cemetery. Sadly, there are less than a handful of 
surviving members of the Six Triple Eight, including Anna Mae Robertson 
of Milwaukee, WI.
  Through efforts like this, we ensure that their story of service and 
sacrifice does not remain lost to history and help to inspire the next 
generation to military service.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Steve 
Yeakel, who is retiring as President and CEO of the Virginia 
Association of Community Banks (VACB) after 13 years of distinguished 
service to Virginia's community banking industry.
  Throughout his tenure, Mr. Yeakel has been an unwavering advocate for 
Virginia's community banks, which serve as the economic backbone of our 
local communities. Under his leadership, VACB has grown to represent 
more than 100 community banks and vendor partners, providing essential 
financial services to families and businesses across the great 
Commonwealth of Virginia. Mr. Yeakel's commitment to excellence was 
recognized by his peers when he received the 2021 CEO Award of 
Excellence by from the Virginia Society of Association Executives. His 
leadership style, emphasizing relationship-building and collaborative 
problem-solving, has strengthened the voice of community banking in 
both Richmond and Washington. During his stewardship, VACB successfully 
navigated serious challenges in the industry, from regulatory changes 
to technological transformation. Mr. Yeakel has been able to achieve 
such impressive accomplishments particularly due to his ability to 
foster productive dialogue between VACB members and Congressional 
delegations over the years.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing Mr. Yeakel's 
significant contributions to Virginia's banking industry and the 
communities it serves. His legacy of leadership, advocacy, and service 
will continue to benefit Virginians for years to come. I wish him and 
his family all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

              CELEBRATING INEZ BEISWANGER'S 105TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and wish a very happy and 
special birthday to Inez Beiswanger, who will turn a whopping 105 years 
old on December 9, 2024.
  Born in Nappanee in 1919, Inez is a resident of Milford, Indiana and 
one of the many

[[Page E1228]]

Hoosiers I have the privilege of representing in Congress. Earlier this 
month, some friends, family, and other members of the Milford community 
came together to throw a surprise celebration for Inez, which was a 
fitting testament to such a special, memorable, and impressive 
milestone.
  As she reflects on more than a century of life well lived, Inez is 
full of gratitude to God for the many blessings he has bestowed on her. 
Especially around this time of year, embracing the disposition of 
gratitude that Inez embodies is something that our Nation could use a 
lot more of.
  Inez also credits her long life in part to trying to always be an 
optimist about everything, as well as being content and happy with what 
you have. This mindset has clearly worked, and it is a refreshening 
antidote to the culture of despair and restlessness that we all too 
often witness.
  As she celebrates more than a century of life lived to the fullest, I 
join her family, including her three children, seven grandchildren and 
numerous great-grandchildren, and many other Hoosiers in wishing Inez 
Beiswanger a very happy 105th birthday.

                          ____________________

       HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LLOYD B. PLUMMER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RUSS FULCHER

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Lloyd B. Plummer a 
very happy 100th birthday, who will be celebrating his milestone on 
December 15, 2024.
  In 1943, Plummer, the recipient of two Purple Hearts, joined the Army 
among many courageous men to serve our country. His heroic efforts will 
never be forgotten.
  For those who may not know Lloyd, he was one of the first brave 
Americans to serve as a paratrooper during World War II, as a member of 
the 509th Infantry Regiment. Throughout the war, the Fighting 509 was 
assigned to numerous operations, many of which are now recognized as 
suicide missions. Lloyd was faced with many battles, where he suffered 
from frostbite, trench foot, burns, and shrapnel. At all times, he was 
ready to put his body on the line to serve the country he loved. He is 
the true definition of a patriot, willing to sacrifice his life for our 
country.
  In 1945, he was discharged from active duty in the Army and returned 
to Idaho. Lloyd and his family have consistently embodied the 
traditional values we cherish in Idaho.
  I thank Lloyd B. Plummer for his unwavering heroic efforts, and I 
wish him a very happy birthday.

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the public service of Dan 
McCorquodale of San Jose, California.
  From 1953 to 1956, McCorquodale was a Sergeant in the U.S. Marine

as Mayor from 1968 to 1969.
  After moving to San Jose, McCorquodale spent a year walking precincts 
in the third district and was elected to three terms representing north 
and east San Jose, a portion of the City of Santa Clara, and the cities 
of Milpitas and Sunnyvale. During his three terms on the Board, he 
distinguished himself in the issues of environmental protection, 
transportation, water reclamation, parks, justice, and health and human 
services. In 1982, McCorquodale was elected State Senator of the 12th

  Throughout his political career, he was recognized for his effective 
policymaking. In 1986, he was recognized as Legislator of the Year by

  It has been my great pleasure to work with Dan throughout the years 
and I honor and thank him for his years in public service and wish him 
the best.

 RECOGNIZING COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, SAMANTHA SNUGGERUD ANDERSON FOR 
    HER EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
                                DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my former 
Communications Director, Samantha Snuggerud Anderson, for her work on 
behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional 
District. In September, Sam was appointed as Communications Director 
for the Minnesota Department of Education under the transformational 
leadership of Governor Tim Walz, and I could not be more proud or 
grateful for her service.
  A Minnesota native, Sam graduated from Minnetonka High School before 
attending Northeastern University in Boston where she earned a 
bachelor's degree in political science. Sam has been an essential 
member of my leadership team since the very beginning, and like me, 
came to this work with a background in marketing and a belief in the 
politics of improving people's lives.
  Spanning impeachments, pandemic, and unrest, the 116th, 117th, and 
118th Congresses were historic by any measure. Just when we thought we 
had cleared the most unprecedented news cycle of our careers, another 
would rise, and I leaned on Sam's counsel to navigate each. She is a 
one-of-a-kind professional whose sound judgement, smart instincts, 
reliable execution, and strategic thinking have been critically 
important to the success of this team.
  We could always count on Sam's calm confidence and level perspective 
to ground us, but also benefitted from her creative spirit and knack 
for innovation. She is an architect and keeper of the Dean Team brand, 
instilling in our community a sense that representation begins with 
listening and a renewed faith in their government.
  Preferring to work behind the scenes, Sam is quick to share kudos and 
credit, but her invisible hand left its mark in every aspect of our 
work. She is a skilled manager who built and led a pioneering 
communications team by identifying potential, carving out space for 
creativity, and challenging herself and others to do their best. When 
pitching a communications idea to Sam, her colleagues have learned to 
have a better strategy than, ``this is the way it has always been 
done!'' She has helped countless staffers grow into communications 
thinkers, coaching even the wonkiest members of our team on meeting--
and making--moments.
  From Good Morning America to the Star Tribune, Sam has been there to 
help pitch, prep, and powder my nose for moments big and small. Under 
her leadership, our communications team became a branding powerhouse, 
crafting powerful messages, landing big interviews, producing 
captivating content, building a mass communications program so strong I 
regularly receive thanks from constituents on the receiving end of 
unsolicited emails, and even going viral for a TikTok dance or two. Sam 
did it all with an eye for authenticity and improvement, and each 
success became a new foundation on which to build.
  Her work helped earn me a seat at the leadership table in 2022 when I 
was elected Co-Chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications 
Committee (DPCC), and her reimagining of communications staffing and 
budgets has been recognized by the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) 
of the House as best in class. Sam has been invited by the CAO to coach 
new Chiefs of Staff on modernizing their own communications teams, 
leadership that will surely leave this institution operating better 
than she found it for generations to come.

[[Page E1229]]

  In addition to her many professional talents, Sam is a genuine and 
thoughtful human, pottery aficionado, gluten-free bread enthusiast, and 
we're all better for having served alongside her.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she is dearly missed. However, 
I'm extraordinarily happy that she will continue to do this work and 
serve the Nation and the people Minnesota at the Minnesota Department 
of Education. I wish Sam all the best in her future endeavors and thank 
her for six years of faithful service to this Nation.

 RECOGNIZING DIRECTOR OF SCHEDULING AND OPERATIONS, MAE HOUGO FOR HER 
  EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Director of 
Scheduling and Operations, Mae Hougo, for her work on behalf of every 
constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District. I could not be 
more proud or grateful for her service.
  Mae was raised in Minnesota and graduated from Cretin-Derham Hall. 
She ventured off to attend the College of Holy Cross where she earned 
her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Government. Mae's passion 
for politics led her to many interesting and informative experiences 
that ranged from City Hall in Saint Paul, the Minnesota State Capitol, 
and Washington, D.C. Her experience of both campaigns and official side 
work have been invaluable.
  Mae has worked as a political scheduler for over five years in 
Minnesota. Her unofficial title is the ``keeper of space and time.'' 
From busy session weeks, to packed August recesses, if things were 
going smoothly for my team and me, it was due to Mae's tireless work. 
Her foresight and creative thinking in a pinch saved each of us from 
more than our fair share of mishaps. Her colleagues will always 
remember Mae's organized and strategic thinking. Mae is dependable, 
determined, fiercely passionate about the work, and incredibly 
hardworking.
  Mae has grown her role immensely during her tenure in this office--
she began her time with us as District Scheduler and ended it as 
Director of Scheduling and Operations, overseeing the scheduling 
process in both Minnesota and Washington, D.C. Mae's sound judgment and 
critical thinking have led her to become a trusted advisor to me. Her 
talent combined with her heart for the work have made her an invaluable 
part of this team.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Mae all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for five 
years of faithful service to this Nation in my office.

   HONORING THE SERVICE OF MINNESOTA STATE REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN PFARR

                                 ______

                       Thursday, December 5, 2024

  Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
Minnesota House Representative Brian Pfarr. First elected in 2020 to 
represent then-District 20A, Representative Pfarr has served the people 
of southern Minnesota in the State House for the past four years, most 
recently as the representative for District 22B.
  Prior to his service in the State Legislature, Representative Pfarr 
honorably served our state as a colonel in the Minnesota Army National 
Guard. Since his retirement in 2021, he has brought the same tireless 
work ethic to representing the people of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Rice, 
and Scott counties.
  The priorities of his constituents have always been at the forefront 
of Representative Pfarr's service in the State House, particularly 
through his continued leadership in the many House committees on which 
he has served throughout the years, including Ways and Means and 
Commerce Finance and Policy.
  Representative Pfarr has done an exemplary job representing the 
people of District 22B, and all of us across southern Minnesota have 
been well-served by his time in office. I am grateful for his many 
years of dedicated public service, and I wish him the warmest 
congratulations on his retirement.

                HONORING THE LEGACY OF SHIRLEY CHISHOLM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Kennedy) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Shirley Chisholm as we mark the 100th anniversary of her birth, 
November 30, 1924, and as we commemorate her many achievements by 
posthumously awarding the Congressional Gold Medal.
  The daughter of immigrants, Shirley Chisholm represents the American 
Dream realized. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, she would go on 
to be a trailblazer, a catalyst for change, and an inspiration for 
generations after her.
  In 1968, she would become the first Black woman elected to the United 
States Congress, and in 1971, was a founding member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus.
  In 1972, she became the first Black woman to run for a major party's 
nomination for President. Before forever changing the national 
political landscape, Shirley Chisholm sought to change her 
neighborhood, jumping into local politics in the 1950s after receiving 
a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a master's in childhood 
education from Columbia University.
  Amid her community, she became an authority on issues concerning 
child welfare and was a staunch advocate for education reform. After 
being elected to serve in the New York State Assembly in 1964, she 
worked to expand food and nutrition programs for the poorest in her 
community and fought to provide disadvantaged students with educational 
opportunities.
  She brought an unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and 
opportunity to Congress serving New York's 12th District for seven 
terms. It was here in these Halls and in this very Chamber that Shirley 
Chisholm advanced policies that provided healthy food options for 
mothers and children, expanded childcare, and strengthened healthcare 
coverage, and much, much more.
  Shirley Chisholm's famous declaration during her historic 
Presidential bid, ``unbought and unbossed,'' continues to resonate as a 
call for courage, authenticity, and integrity in public service.
  I am deeply honored to represent the district that serves as her 
final resting place at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. It 
was in our community that she married her husband, the late Assemblyman 
Arthur Hardwick, Jr., and it is here that the two of them made their 
home following her retirement from Congress.
  Her presence in our community is a powerful reminder of her enduring 
legacy. We are forever indebted to her for her service in advancing 
civil rights, women's rights, and making our Nation more equitable for 
all.
  Yet, let us remember Shirley Chisholm not only for her achievements, 
but for the doors she opened and for others to follow. May she rest in 
peace and power.


               Remembering Private First Class Allen Gang

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of 
Private First Class Allen Gang, who passed away on November 10, 2024.
  Born into a family with deep military roots, he entered the United 
States Army at the age of 19. He served in Vietnam in the 17th Calvary 
Regiment of the 199th Infantry Brigade where he sustained an injury 
while in combat in February of 1968.
  Upon his return to the United States, Private First Class Gang 
married his beloved wife, Kitty. Together, they raised six children.
  He received numerous awards honoring his dedication and valor 
displayed during his service, including the Good Conduct Medal, 
National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, as well as 
numerous badges and ribbons.
  In June, I had the distinct privilege of presenting Private First 
Class Gang with his Purple Heart Medal, awarded to servicemembers who 
have been wounded or killed as a result of enemy action while serving 
in our military.
  A lifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans and a member of 
the American Legion Post 721 in his beloved south Buffalo, he 
exemplified the enduring spirit of camaraderie and service. He leaves 
behind his wife, 6

[[Page H6366]]

children, 15 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.
  With bravery and commitment, Allen Gang served this Nation 
contributing to the freedoms we enjoy today.
  May he rest in peace.

                        SHOPPING SMALL BUSINESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 
economic heartbeat of Iowa, our small businesses.
  In Iowa, over 99 percent of businesses are small, many of which are 
family-owned. That is over 282,000 small businesses employing more than 
616,000 people.
  At a time of great economic uncertainty across the country, Iowa has 
been a beacon of hope and proven to be one of the best States to own 
and operate a business.
  This past weekend, we celebrated Small Business Saturday encouraging 
folks to shop local for the holidays. As we approach Christmas and the 
New Year, I encourage Iowans and Americans everywhere to continue 
supporting small businesses and shopping local during this holiday 
season.
  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and without them, 
we don't have large businesses and our Nation's economic engine would 
falter.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the vital contributions 
of small businesses in Iowa and across the country, and to continue 
advocating for their success.


     Recognizing Iowa Regional Teacher of the Year Kaitlin Mahoney

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the first-
ever Iowa Regional Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Kaitlin Mahoney. Mrs. 
Mahoney has taught at Bettendorf High School for 11 years, molding the 
minds of our future generations.
  Mrs. Mahoney believes that education begins with the ability to 
engage students. She has worked vigorously to adapt the school algebra 
curriculum, enabling hundreds of students to move on to higher 
education. She also works as a student counselor, pushing students 
toward achievements previously unthinkable.
  It is the creativity and passion of educators like Mrs. Mahoney that 
will push this Nation across the finish line of our educational goals. 
The fostering of our youth must be at the forefront of concern in this 
Nation if it is to remain the greatest country in the world.
  She will be competing against other finalists for the title of the 
2025 Iowa Educator of the Year, the winner of which will be announced 
later this year. I wish Mrs. Mahoney all the luck in the world.


              Maintaining the Values of American Democracy

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5349, 
the Crucial Communism Teaching Act.
  This important bill directs the Victims of Communism Memorial 
Foundation to develop a curriculum that teaches high school students 
about the dangers of communism and its conflict with the values of 
American democracy.
  As communist nations continue ramping up their aggression toward the 
U.S., it is crucial that we educate the next generation on the stark 
realities of totalitarian regimes and human suffering caused by 
communism.
  By providing students with these critical resources, we can help them 
understand the importance of liberty, individual rights, free markets, 
and the constitutional principles that define our Nation. This bill 
will prepare our young people to be responsible citizens who can 
safeguard the freedoms we hold dear.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5349 and ensure 
that future generations are educated on the lessons of history.


      Recognizing the Iowa Computer Science Technology Association

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Iowa 
Computer Science Technology Association for helping Iowa rank amongst 
the top 10 States in the Nation for providing access to high-quality 
computer science education.
  Iowa's top 10 ranking in the 2023-2024 academic year of computer 
science class availability beats the national average by 24 percent, 
with 84 percent of public schools offering computer science classes.
  With computer and information technology jobs rising exponentially 
across the United States, the efforts of these passionate educators 
will be reflected in the success of Iowa's youth as they set the 
standard in the workforce.
  As we move forward in the ever-changing technological climate, it is 
imperative that we continue to develop innovative ways of helping our 
students achieve success, not only on the national stage, but on the 
world stage, as well.
  This is a win for the people of Iowa and for America. The fight for 
educational success is never over, and we must continue to prioritize 
education, continually aiming for a brighter future for our students.


             Honoring the 83rd Anniversary of Pearl Harbor

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as Saturday, December 7, 
will be the honoring and remembering of the 83rd anniversary of the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, a day that will live in infamy, a day that 
claimed the lives of 2,403 American heroes.
  On December 7, 1941, a peaceful Sunday morning was torn apart when 
Japan launched a surprise assault on our naval base in Hawaii. Ships 
were sunk, planes were destroyed, and lives were lost. Indeed, there is 
the USS Arizona Memorial that remains there today.
  From this devastating attack, our Nation's strength and unity 
emerged. Pearl Harbor awakened an unshakable spirit of patriotism and 
resolve. Americans, ordinary men and women, answered the call to defend 
freedom and protect the ideals that make this country great and that 
continued democracy throughout the world.
  Let us honor those who sacrificed everything and remember their 
courage and dedication. Their legacy lives on in the enduring strength 
of this Nation, which will never falter in the face of adversity and 
will always stand for freedom and justice.

                          ____________________

                         FROM DETROIT TO BHOPAL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, from Detroit to Bhopal, we have a right to 
breathe clean air. This week marks 40 years since the Bhopal chemicals 
disaster in India, and the survivors are still sick and waiting for 
justice.
  Union Carbide, driven by corporate greed, caused one of the worst 
chemical disasters in history, poisoning the residents and communities.
  I was honored to meet some of the survivors and proud to join them in 
their fight for justice. I joined Senator Merkley and Representative 
Jayapal to introduce a resolution reaffirming the need for stronger 
laws to prevent these tragedies and keep communities safe.
  Many of our communities in Michigan's 12th District live in shadows 
of corporate polluters, so this fight is personal to me. We are tired 
of greedy corporations poisoning our communities and getting away with 
it.
  In the Bhopal chemical disaster, around 20,000 people were killed 
when poison gas was released into the air. Nearly half a million people 
have suffered illnesses and premature death after the initial incident.
  Of course, the U.S. refused to extradite the CEO of Union Carbide, 
the company that owned and ran the Bhopal facility, to face criminal 
charges.
  We need and deserve a better world, not a world where the color of 
your skin, your income, or your neighborhood where you were born puts 
you at a higher risk of being exposed to pollution that causes disease 
and death.
  We see it in places like Detroit and Dearborn's Southend communities 
where there are higher rates of cancer and asthma. We cannot tolerate a 
world where corporations take all of the profit and none of the 
liability.
  Dow Chemical knowingly took responsibility for this disaster when it 
bought the company. Yet, they still refused to compensate the 
survivors. Dow was headquartered in Michigan, and if they think their 
actions are just going

[[Page H6367]]

to be lost in history, well, I am here to say they have got another 
thing coming. Dow must pay what is owed to the people of Bhopal.


      Michigan Education Compliance for Students with Disabilities

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this is a plea on behalf 182,000 families who 
will have students with disabilities in Michigan. Year after year, we 
continue to fall short on the promise to fully fund the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act, which many call IDEA.
  Failing to help our students to obtain the services they need to 
learn is, again, years that we cannot get back for our children. With 
this shortfall, we continue to undermine our students with 
disabilities.
  The education gap is continuing to widen. There is currently a 22 
percent drop-out rate for students with disabilities in Michigan, 
where, for nondisabled students it is only 8 percent.

                              {time}  1015

  Schools use assessments to measure student proficiency and 
achievement, and under the IDEA, students with disabilities are 
expected to participate in State assessments.
  However, every year between 2017 and 2022, the State of Michigan has 
requested the Department of Education to approve a waiver to increase 
the 1 percent gap required by the Federal Government for the number of 
students with disabilities who can take Michigan's alternative 
assessment. It is because we are at double.
  We often don't do enough to support our kids who need to go through 
this, nor do we advise our parents properly. Budget cuts often 
shortchange individualized learning, plans that are crucial for 
students with disabilities.
  However, according to the Autism Alliance of Michigan, the dropout 
rate for students with disabilities is double the amount. Disparities 
are even worse for students of color with disabilities.
  We need to fully fund IDEA, and we know that will help Michigan serve 
our students. It will help reduce the amount of inappropriate 
assessments and improve access to information and support for our 
school districts.
  It is disheartening to see the State of Michigan's Department of 
Education now before an administrative hearing judge because they are 
not in compliance with the Federal laws. This is the first time in 27 
years that our U.S. Department of Education had to drag a State through 
an administrative hearing process. It is shameful that we are at this 
point after over a year of negotiations.
  We have to do better. These are our children, and again, we cannot 
get these years back for them. We have to do right.


                   Trump Tariffs Would Be Devastating

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, Detroit is not only the most beautiful, 
Blackest city in the country, but it also houses the most important 
trade corridor in the Nation. Mr. Speaker, 27 percent of trade comes 
through our amazing city.
  Tariffs are one tool, but they have costs and benefits that must be 
considered regarding trade. Used strategically, we know they can help 
new industries, support resilient supply chains, and even promote high-
road labor as well as environmental practices.
  However, the cost of Trump's tariffs proposal would be devastating 
for our families--take our auto industry, for instance. The U.S. relies 
on $97 billion worth of auto parts and millions of finished vehicles 
from Canada and Mexico, but Trump's tariffs, as it is now, would raise 
the price of new cars by $3,000. Our families cannot afford that cost.
  What about our grocery costs? More than half of our fruits and 
vegetables come from Canada and Mexico. My residents are already 
struggling to cover the rising prices of groceries. Again, we cannot 
toy with our residents' ability to put food on the table or provide for 
their families.

                         JUST SAY NO TO GRANTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, most of the stories we read every day 
about outrageous government waste stems from a category of government 
funding called grants.
  From the $3 million grant to study how hamsters fight each other to 
the $3.7 million in grants given to the Wuhan virology lab that likely 
unleashed COVID upon the world, these are the very essence of 
government waste.
  Government grants fall into two major varieties: gifts of public 
money for every cause under the Sun and grants for local projects of 
every variety.
  They are all for good causes. They go to universities, companies, 
NGOs, civic groups, charities, local governments, State governments, 
and do-gooders of every kind, all promising some public benefit.
  Unfortunately, by their very nature, they are plagued with lax 
oversight, political favoritism, little followup, and questionable 
benefits. Indeed, much of the grant money doled out each year 
disappears into the salaries of various groups and agencies that will 
then write glowing reports of their work and apply for more grants next 
year in an ever-expanding litany of waste.
  There is never a shortage of highly paid grant application writers 
eager to make that case.
  ``Personally, I liked the university,'' says Dan Akroyd's character 
in ``Ghostbusters.'' ``They gave us money and facilities. We didn't 
have to produce anything. You have never been out of college. You don't 
know what it is like out there. I have worked in the private sector. 
They expect results.''
  If the Federal Government needs a particular good or service that it 
can't produce itself, it should send out a request for a proposal 
specifying what it needs and then award a contract to the lowest 
responsible bidder to provide it. Then, the contractor should be held 
accountable for delivering that good or service.
  Another major class of grant recipients are local and State 
governments. Who can begrudge grants for law enforcement, wastewater 
treatment, transportation, homeless shelters, or schools? Yet, all of 
these grant programs beg a fundamental question: If a project 
exclusively benefits a local community, shouldn't it be paid for 
exclusively by that local community?
  Why should the taxpayers in Pocatello be forced to pay for sidewalks 
in Poughkeepsie? Robbing St. Petersburg to pay Saint Paul turns our 
Federal Treasury into a grab bag for local pork projects that destroys 
the entire concept of New Federalism.

  Local decisions and local money should be made and spent locally.
  By definition, local grants are lower priority projects that simply 
can't make the cut when local governments are measuring their own local 
needs against their own local resources. They only make economic sense 
if somebody else can be stuck with the tab, and that is what grants do.
  Money flows from politically powerless communities to politically 
powerful ones, often for frivolous projects that don't merit a place in 
local budgets. Because these Federal grants come with lots of strings 
attached, they are also inefficiently applied. But who cares since it 
is all free money?
  A very simple test should be applied to this class of grants. If the 
project exclusively benefits a local community, that local community 
should pay for it. With that burden also comes the freedom to spend 
those dollars exactly as they are most needed. Federal resources should 
be reserved for projects that benefit the entire country. That is the 
difference between the Federal interstate highway system and a local 
street.
  This is not a small matter. Between 2016 and 2020, Federal grant 
spending ballooned from $675 billion to $972 billion, and that is 
exclusive of Medicaid grants to States. That is nearly half of the 
annual Federal deficit right there.
  Weeding them out or reforming them is no easy task because a thriving 
political ecosystem of wealth and favor supports them. In last year's 
spending spree, both parties indulged themselves with 8,222 
congressional earmarks, a particular subset of grant spending where 
individual Congressmen handpick their recipients.
  Here is a modest proposal for the DOGE boys: Stop the cash bonanza to 
every self-described deserving cause and influential community with a 
good grant writer. Budget writers and appropriators should look with 
extreme skepticism on every grant that awards

[[Page H6368]]

money without results or that robs taxpayers in one community to pay 
for projects in another.
  It is time that we protected and reserved the Federal Treasury for 
the general welfare of the United States, as our Constitution 
envisioned.

                      SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER SIEGE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Tiffany). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the strength of our 
economy, employing half of all Americans and driving prosperity across 
our communities and our country. We all know that.
  Yet, these businesses are continually put under siege by an avalanche 
of Federal regulations. The Biden administration has imposed $1.5 
trillion in regulatory costs and 326 million hours of paperwork on 
small businesses. That is hard to believe, but it is true. That is time 
and money that entrepreneurs should be spending to grow their 
businesses and, of course, create jobs.
  That is why I strongly support the Prove It Act, which we will be 
voting on today. This legislation forces Federal agencies to analyze 
the true costs of their regulations and consider the direct and 
indirect burdens on small businesses, which is so very important.

                              {time}  1030

  It allows small businesses to challenge unfair rules, ensures greater 
transparency, and even exempts entrepreneurs from regulations if 
agencies fail to comply with these requirements.
  Small businesses should be able to focus on expanding operations, 
hiring workers, and serving their customers, not navigating the Federal 
Government's continuous red tape.
  The Prove It Act will empower businessowners, protect jobs, and 
restore common sense to our regulatory process. Let's defend the 
American entrepreneurial spirit by passing the Prove It Act and 
unleashing the full potential of every small business throughout our 
country and certainly throughout my State, the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.

                  CELEBRATING KAMBRIDGE ELDER AND COSI

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heart full of pride to 
celebrate a little magic from my district in Columbus, Ohio, a place 
where innovation, creativity, and community come together.
  Today, that magic has an exciting connection to the U.S. Capitol 
Christmas Tree. What is the magic? The magic is the bright young mind 
of Kambridge Elder and the incredible work of COSI, the Center of 
Science and Industry.
  While I am here, I also want to encourage my colleagues to support 
the bipartisan National STEM Week Act because brighter futures don't 
happen by chance. They happen by choice.
  Let's start with the tree. This year's Capitol Christmas tree 
traveled over 4,000 miles from the breathtaking forests of Alaska to 
Washington, D.C., making 14 stops along the way. One of those special 
stops was in my congressional district, where the tree picked up an 
ornament designed by Kambridge Elder, a seventh grader in my district 
at the Arts IMPACT Middle School.
  Through a partnership with the Ohio Arts Council, COSI invited 
students from all 611 Ohio school districts to design ornaments 
inspired by the theme ``Building STEAM in Ohio.''
  STEAM--science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics--
isn't just a buzzword, Mr. Speaker. It is a foundation for progress.
  Kambridge's ornament, a train with four carts representing each of 
the STEAM elements, was inspired by a train at her school that she 
loves. Her ornament isn't just a decoration. It is a vision. It is a 
symbol of what happens when we invest in our children and give them the 
tools to dream big.
  Kambridge's story reminds us of the vital role institutions like COSI 
play in sparking curiosity, discovery, and innovation.
  Under the bold leadership of Dr. Frederic Bertley, COSI has become a 
powerhouse of education and inspiration, earning its title as the 
Nation's number one science museum 4 years in a row with USA Today 
Readers' Choice Awards. Forbes calls COSI ``a beacon of scientific 
engagement,'' and that is exactly what it is.
  From the COSI Science Festival to the wildly successful STEM Kit 
Program, COSI is making science accessible and exciting for families 
and kids--not just in Columbus, Mr. Speaker, but across the Nation.
  Kambridge's creativity, fueled by COSI's mission, is proof of what is 
possible when we nurture curiosity and celebrate imagination.
  That is why I am here to urge my colleagues to support the National 
STEM Week Act. This bipartisan bill, which I am a cosponsor of, will 
dedicate a week each year to highlighting the importance of STEM and 
STEAM education.
  It is about bringing together Federal, State, and local governments 
with schools, families, and organizations like COSI to close the 
knowledge gap holding too many of our children back.
  It is about giving every child, no matter their ZIP Code, a shot at a 
better future.
  It is about ensuring America remains a global leader by fostering 
creativity and problem-solving skills that drive innovation.
  It is about young people like Kambridge, who I hope is watching 
today, showing us what is possible when we invest in their potential.
  Mr. Speaker, when we look at the Capitol Christmas tree, let us 
remember that every ornament tells a story. Kambridge's ornament isn't 
just her story. It is ours.

  Let us commit to building a future where every child can dream, 
create, and achieve, securing their future and the future of this 
Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kambridge Elder and her principal, her 
teachers, and her family for being a big support to her.

                  NATIONAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION WEEK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. Lee Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Influenza 
Vaccination Week and to emphasize the importance of protecting our 
communities through vaccination.
  Each year, the flu affects between 9 million and 41 million 
Americans, leading to 12,000 to 52,000 deaths depending on the severity 
of the season.
  In the 2022-2023 flu season alone, we saw approximately 360,000 
hospitalizations and 21,000 deaths nationally.
  In Houston, home to the world-renowned Texas Medical Center, our 
healthcare professionals are on the front lines during peak flu season, 
managing increased patient loads and saving lives.
  The flu is not just a seasonal inconvenience. It is a serious health 
threat, particularly for children like my own, older adults, and those 
with chronic conditions.
  Vaccination is our best defense. According to the CDC, getting a flu 
shot reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.
  I am highly concerned about the anti-vaccine messaging that is spread 
throughout social media and even on the news, and I am highly concerned 
that our next administration is selecting potential nominees for our 
most revered health agencies that have anti-vaccination messaging.
  I would encourage all Americans to get vaccinated against the flu to 
help our vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and infants 
who cannot be vaccinated themselves. Each year, unfortunately, 
vaccination rates fall well short of recommended levels.
  The National Influenza Vaccination Week serves as an important 
reminder that it is not too late to get vaccinated.
  The flu season can last all the way through May, and every 
vaccination helps to protect not just the individual but also their 
family, friends, and neighbors.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Houstonians and Americans to do their 
part to prevent the spread of influenza and protect public health in 
the United States.


                            Texas Libraries

  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss one of our national

[[Page H6369]]

treasures, and these are our libraries, especially at our schools.
  Libraries are essential in addressing the achievement gap, and as a 
former first grade teacher, I know how important it is to all children. 
Libraries provide students with access to books, technology, and 
trained librarians who foster literacy and academic success.
  Yet in Texas, we are seeing a troubling trend. Houston ISD, which is 
primarily in my district, has cut 28 librarian positions, and Spring 
Branch ISD has replaced certified librarians with less qualified staff.
  Statewide, over one in five schools no longer has a full-time 
librarian. These cuts disproportionately affect underserved communities 
where students rely on libraries for resources they lack at home.
  At the same time, Texas has approved a Bible-based curriculum for 
public schools. While this curriculum is optional, it does nothing to 
close the achievement gap.
  Instead of focusing on ideological narratives, we should invest in 
proven solutions, like restoring librarian positions to provide 
equitable access to education and ensure all students can thrive.
  Books, which could include the Bible, but many other books, are 
gateways to opportunity, and librarians are essential guides in that 
journey. Let's invest in real solutions to ensure every child has the 
tools to succeed.


           Honoring the Faculty of Texas Southern University

  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of 
several Texas Southern University faculty researchers in the 18th 
Congressional District and the great city of Houston.
  Since the foundation of Texas Southern University, a historically 
Black college and university, it has remained a pillar to the Third 
Ward and the African-American community in Houston at large.
  It is home to more than 1,400 outstanding faculty and staff members 
who each play a critical role in helping this historic institution 
shape and mold the future of America's finest students.
  I would like to recognize a few of the contributions of these faculty 
researchers who have blazed a path in their respective fields of study: 
Dr. Robert Bullard, whom my mother, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, 
worked with closely, is the founding director of the Bullard Center for 
Environmental and Climate Justice. He is a distinguished professor of 
urban planning and environmental policy and is often referred to as the 
father of environmental justice.
  He has addressed topics such as environmental racism, urban land use, 
housing, sustainability, climate justice, and community resilience in 
18 books. Dr. Bullard has also helped garner the support of more than 
$70 million in external funding.

  Dr. Howard Henderson is the founding director of the Center for 
Justice Research and a professor of justice administration in the 
Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs. He serves as an 
advisory board member of the Vera Institute's Rural Jail Research 
Policy Network. Dr. Henderson is a member of the National Scientific 
Advisory Committee at the Institute of Justice Research and Development 
at Florida State University and is a member of the National Science 
Foundation's STEM Opportunities in Prison Settings workgroup. He has 
also secured over $2 million in research funding.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for these great leaders in research.

                    MOURNING THE LOSS OF JOE TANNER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
the former Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Joe Tanner, who 
sadly passed away on Sunday, November 24.
  Mr. Tanner had an impressive career in the State government for 26 
years, making him the longest serving commissioner of the Georgia 
Department of Natural Resources.
  He was first appointed to the position of commissioner for the 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources in 1972. Mr. Tanner served as 
commissioner until 1984 and completed a second term of service from 
1990 to 1995.
  Mr. Tanner accomplished many impressive achievements throughout his 
career. He was responsible for over 400 legislative efforts and 
consolidated 38 State agencies into the DNR.
  Mr. Tanner was a dedicated servant to the environment and law, known 
for establishing a State single-point environmental permitting system.
  Mr. Tanner will forever be remembered for his excellence and 
dedicated service to the State of Georgia. My heart and my thoughts go 
out to his family, friends, and all those who had the pleasure of 
working alongside him.


                    Congratulating Cassandra Cannon

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Cassandra Cannon for her placement in Inc.'s 2024 Female Founders 250 
list.
  Since launching her luxury lingerie company, Lake, Ms. Cannon has 
expanded her company immensely, growing Lake's revenue by 50 percent, 
customer base by 185 percent, and roster of employees by 134 percent in 
2023 alone.
  Prior to launching the company, Cannon was preparing to begin medical 
school and her cofounder, Anne Read Lattimore, was working in the 
pharmaceutical industry.
  The two realized there were improvements to be made in the women's 
sleepwear industry and decided to exit the medical field to launch Lake 
in 2014.
  The company boasts a spectacular headquarters on West Harris Street, 
coupled with a design studio on Broughton Street in Savannah and 
fulfillment center in Pooler.
  Congratulations to Ms. Cannon, Ms. Lattimore, and the dedicated 
employees of Lake on this stellar achievement. I look forward to 
watching this company flourish in years to come.


            Kia 15-Year Manufacturing Anniversary in Georgia

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kia 
on 15 years of manufacturing in the State of Georgia.
  Boasting 2,200 expansive acres of land in West Point, Georgia, Kia's 
manufacturing plant is the first North American manufacturing site for 
the corporation, based in Seoul, South Korea.
  After its groundbreaking ceremony in October of 2006, Kia has 
increased its capacity to produce 350,000 vehicles per year.
  Soon Kia will complete its $217 million expansion to allow for the 
production of electric vehicles in addition to the plant's customary 
products.
  I extend my most sincere thanks and congratulations to Kia and its 
Georgia team for their hard work and contributions to growing and 
strengthening American manufacturing.
  Congratulations to Kia and its Georgia team on this significant 
milestone. I look forward to watching the company continue to provide 
jobs, opportunity, and top-notch products in Georgia for many years to 
come.


                      Congratulating Georgia Tech

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Georgia 
Tech

[[Page H6370]]

for ranking number one among public schools in the South. This 
achievement was recently reported by The Wall Street Journal and 
deservedly reflects the university's impressive legacy.
  Georgia Tech has retained its number one spot for industrial 
engineering and has recently achieved this top ranking for civil 
engineering.
  Meanwhile, the university's aerospace, biomedical, computer, 
mechanical, and materials engineering programs all ranked in the top 
four among all universities nationwide.
  Georgia Tech is a leader in advancing research and preparing students

achievement and a source of pride for Georgians everywhere.
  Our public universities are great options for young people to get a 
quality education, and Georgia Tech embodies this to the fullest.
  These well-deserved rankings highlight the commitment of students and 
staff alike to maintaining a culture of innovation and of excellence.
  I congratulate the students, the staff, and the alumni of Georgia 
Tech.

                WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE AT RISK

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Manning) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, as I rise today, women's basic reproductive 
freedoms are under relentless attack by rightwing politicians and 
judges across the country.
  Over 2 years ago, Donald Trump's hand-picked MAGA Supreme Court 
Justices overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling 50 years of judicial 
precedent.
  This catastrophic decision has left one in three women living under 
outright abortion bans and unleashed a coordinated effort to undermine 
the full range of reproductive healthcare, including access to birth 
control.
  In his concurring opinion in the Dobbs case, Justice Clarence Thomas 
explicitly called for revisiting the right to contraception. Despite 
the fact that over 90 percent of women rely on contraception at some 
point in their lives, extremist Republicans have seized on this as a 
rallying cry to target birth control.
  In Oklahoma, Republican lawmakers have proposed radical legislation 
to outlaw widely used forms of contraception, including IUDs and the 
morning-after pill.
  In States like Virginia, Arizona, Tennessee, and North Carolina, 
extremist Republicans have blocked efforts to protect access to 
contraception.
  Adding to this alarming trend, Trump's Project 2025 blueprint 
outlines a dangerous agenda to further dismantle reproductive 
healthcare, including targeting emergency contraception and insurance 
coverage for birth control.
  Despite his campaign claims of ignorance about Project 2025, Trump is 
now staffing his administration with the very architects of this 
extreme agenda.
  I refuse to stand by and let these MAGA extremists interfere with 
women's private healthcare decisions. That is why I am fighting to pass 
my Right to Contraception Act to ensure every American has the right to 
access the full range of FDA-approved birth control.
  This legislation is a safeguard against the growing threats to 
contraceptive rights. It ensures that every American can make crucial 
decisions about their health, their family planning, and their future.
  The Right to Contraception Act guarantees the right to access 
contraceptive services and protects healthcare providers' ability to 
deliver them. It also secures access to the full range of contraceptive 
methods, including birth control pills, IUDs, and emergency 
contraceptives like Plan B.
  In June, I was proud to announce a discharge petition to bring my 
bill to the House floor for a vote, and I invited my Republican 
colleagues who claim to support the right to contraception to join me 
in signing it. All these months later, not a single House Republican 
has signed that petition.
  This comes after 195 House Republicans voted against the right to 
obtain birth control in the last Congress, and the legislation was 
blocked by Republicans in the Senate.
  To quote award-winning poet and fellow North Carolinian Maya Angelou: 
``When someone shows you who they are, believe them. . . . ''
  Time and time again, extremist Republicans have shown us exactly who 
they are. Their attacks on reproductive rights didn't stop with Roe. In 
fact, they are just getting started.
  In contrast, we Democrats believe that every American has the right 
to decide whether, when, and with whom to have children. No politician 
or judge should have the power to take that right away.
  Republicans purport to believe in small government. Let them start by 
staying out of our bedrooms and our doctors' offices.
  While I may soon be departing Congress because of the outrageous 
gerrymandering by the Republican-controlled legislature in North 
Carolina, let me be clear: I will never stop fighting for women to 
receive the basic reproductive healthcare they need and deserve.

                              {time}  1045
                      WASHINGTON'S FISCAL INSANITY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. Mann) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, when I come to this floor, I often speak about 
how our brightest days are yet to come, about the next generation of 
Americans, and about the future we should be working to build for them.
  Currently, the Biden administration and Washington's embrace of 
fiscal insanity is a stumbling block to reaching that future. In 
November, America's national debt climbed to $36 trillion.
  This is not normal. Washington, D.C., has a spending addiction, and 
it is just expected that Americans and future generations of Americans 
will pay for it. Our Nation, our children, our future grandchildren, 
and our future great-grandchildren cannot afford for us to continue 
kicking the can down the road.
  Last year, the U.S. Census revealed that the median household income 
was nearly $80,000. Today, if everyone decided to pitch in and tackle 
our debt, every American household would need to contribute almost 
$273,000 to bring our balance to zero.
  Compare that price tag to the average mortgage in the United States, 
which is about $245,000. Our national debt 4 years ago was nearly $28 
trillion. Over the course of 1,400 days, the United States accumulated 
a debt of $68,352 per second.
  No American family could survive that way. Yet, year after year, this 
is the way our Federal Government acts. This is not sustainable.
  If any Member of this body had a loved one who was racking up debt at 
this rate, none of us would encourage them to mindlessly continue their 
spending habits. We would do what we could to help them evaluate their 
spending and get them back on the right track.
  Yet, only about half of this body seems to care about how our Federal 
Government spends our tax dollars. Our fiscal house is in utter 
disaster, and we need to get serious and start finding solutions.
  Since I was sworn into Congress, I have sounded the alarm on our 
national debt. I have opposed bloated spending packages that only 
focused on funding far-left wish lists. I fought to reduce and 
reprioritize our Federal spending. I have challenged this body to think 
about the blank checks we are writing and ask ourselves: Is there a way 
to do this more efficiently?
  This petition has often been ignored while Washington sticks to 
business as normal and spends, spends, spends. Enough is enough. This 
is not fiscal responsibility. This is fiscal insanity.
  On November 5, 2024, America made it clear that we no longer want 
business as usual in this town. It is time to get our fiscal house in 
order and to get our country back on track.
  As America approaches its 250th birthday, President-elect Trump was 
spot-on in creating the Department of Government Efficiency as a 
perfect gift to our Nation and to the next generation of Americans.
  Mr. President, hear me loud and clear: We will work with you to make 
our government work for the people again, to make it efficient again, 
and

[[Page H6371]]

to clean up our fiscal house. Let's work together to end the Federal 
Government's out-of-control spending once and for all.
  This challenge is not going to be easy, but America is worth it. The 
future of our country is worth it. The next generation of Americans is 
worth it.
  I know that we can do it. We are going to have to do it together, and 
our brightest days truly are yet to come.

                          ____________________

           UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR AFRICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
strengthening United States' relationships with Africa and the 
Caribbean.
  The history and culture of the United States is inextricably linked 
to Africa and the Caribbean. The brutal history of colonialism, 
slavery, and the middle passage has shaped our shared destinies.
  As people of African descent in the Americas and Africans on the 
continent, we commemorate all of our tragedies and triumphs of the last 
four centuries. We know that there is strength and comfort in 
celebrating our shared Black ancestry and identity.
  These vital historic ties are an opportunity for the United States. 
As I travel in Africa and the Caribbean, I hear from many people, 
business leaders, and government leaders. They are actively seeking to 
partner with the United States. They specifically want to work with 
Americans to tackle global challenges that impact us all. Yet, 
Washington too often ignores or cannot hear these voices. We fail to 
invest the time, resources, and energy into building true partnerships.
  We have entered a new era of global competition. Governments like 
those of China and Russia openly seek to be the partner of choice. 
There is a void, thanks to our neglect, that they are filling.
  People in Africa and the Caribbean want to work with America as the 
partner of choice. If their partner of choice is not listening to them 
as sovereign countries, they will make decisions on their bilateral and 
multilateral alliances which exclude those countries which have all but 
ignored them.
  America needs to step up our game if we want to build the true and 
deep partnerships that will advance our shared goals.
  In these countries, respect, development assistance, trade, and 
investments go a long way. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Dennis 
devastated the Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in damage. I 
worked very hard to get a small amount of reconstruction assistance, 
which was $40 million, for Grenada. When I visited Grenada later, there 
were signs everywhere for the first time that read: Thank you, USA.
  It is also important that Members of Congress get out and visit 
African and Caribbean countries. China shows up, believe me, every day 
in Africa and the Caribbean. Members of the United States Congress need 
to show up.

  I remember once, when I visited Grenada just a couple of years ago, I 
stopped by the United States State Department Office there. I saw a 
picture on the wall of myself, the former chair of the Western 
Hemisphere Subcommittee, Congressman Eliot Engel, and several Members 
of Congress from a codel when we visited Grenada in 2007.
  I asked if that codel had made an impact, and I was told, in fact, 
that 2007 was the last time there had been a congressional delegation 
to Grenada. That is outrageous.
  I believe that this work can and should be bipartisan. Two decades 
ago, I worked with George Bush to designate June as the Caribbean 
American Heritage Month. Today, that commemoration is still celebrated 
among people in the Caribbean and Caribbean Americans here in the 
United States. It is a useful tool for building bridges with our 
Caribbean neighbors.
  I am proud that, during my term leading the House Committee on 
Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs, I have worked substantially to increase American investment 
and partnerships with Africa and the Caribbean.
  As the chair of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs, I managed to increase the development assistance 
account by more than $800 million. We were able to invest that increase 
in important priorities, like Prosper America, to grow jobs and incomes 
in Africa and the United States; Power Africa, which seeks to connect 
60 million Africans to reliable electricity; and the United States 
African Development Foundation, which invests directly in African 
entrepreneurship and the Young African Leaders Initiative, which seeks 
to lift up and strengthen the brightest flowers of African youth.
  In the Caribbean, I created a program to invest in inclusive economic 
growth for the first time and worked with the State Department to 
expand our Caribbean diplomatic presence. One of our embassies in 
Barbados is responsible for seven countries. They don't even have a 
plane. They can't travel to those seven countries they are responsible 
for, so we are expanding our presence there.
  We expanded support for small-island states coping with sea-level 
rise and invested in the Caribbean Base and Security Initiative to 
tackle transnational security challenges, like crime and drug 
trafficking.
  Mr. Speaker, these investments are crucial, not only to support 
American security and interests, but to build an equitable and 
inclusive world which we seek.
  I urge my colleagues to listen carefully to African and Caribbean 
voices. We have millions of people of African descent in our own 
country. We have to continue to build these bridges toward a shared 
just and prosperous future for all people.

           FEDERAL HIGHWAY SAFETY STANDARDS ARE NOT OPTIONAL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Lopez) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that affects 
all of us deeply: the safety of our roads and the lives of those who 
travel on them.
  Each year, preventable tragedies unfold on our highways. Families are 
shattered, lives are cut short, and dreams are lost. This is not 
because of chance, but because, somewhere along the way, safety 
standards were neglected, corners were cut, and human lives were 
undervalued.
  This isn't just about statistics or regulations. It is about people: 
fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, friends, and neighbors. These are 
people who trust the system in place to protect them, such as the 
Federal highway safety standards, which exist for one purpose: to save 
lives.
  These guidelines are not arbitrary. They are the result of decades of 
research, real-world testing, and collaboration among safety experts, 
engineers, and policymakers. We know what works to prevent accidents, 
protect construction zones, and keep our roads safe. Yet, in Colorado, 
time and time again, we see these safeguards disregarded, with 
devastating consequences.
  Think about the mother driving home from her nightshift who never 
made it to her kids because her car was rear-ended in an improperly 
managed construction zone. Think about the newlyweds, full of hope and 
plans for the future, killed when a semi overturned due to inadequate 
lane shifts and insufficient traffic controls.
  These are not just accidents. They are preventable failures to 
prioritize safety, to honor the trust of those who use our roads, and 
to follow the very standards designed to prevent these tragedies.
  Federal highway safety standards are not optional. They are essential 
safeguards meant to ensure that every person who steps onto a highway 
has the best chance of getting to where they are going alive and 
uninjured. Cutting corners on these standards isn't just irresponsible, 
but it is unacceptable. Every poorly designed lane shift, every missing 
warning sign, every unfunded safety measure represents a choice to put 
cost or convenience above human life.
  The Colorado Department of Transportation has a responsibility and a 
moral and professional duty to follow

[[Page H6372]]

these standards without compromise. This is not about bureaucracy. This 
is about humanity.

  The failure to adhere to these safety guidelines is a failure to 
uphold the sacred trust we placed in them every time we step onto the 
highway. It is a failure to protect the workers in construction zones, 
who deserve to go home to their families at the end of the day. It is a 
failure to protect the people who rely on these roads for their 
livelihoods, their loved ones, and their lives.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot stand idly by as construction-zone fatalities 
in Colorado reach record highs. We know that CDOT receives over 40 
percent of its funding from Federal programs. Yet, it continues to 
operate with a lack of transparency and accountability.
  Legislators seeking answers to basic safety questions through CORA 
requests have faced roadblocks. Meanwhile, Colorado's construction-zone 
deaths have increased year after year, making 2024 the worst year since 
2020. This points to a systemic failure not just within CDOT, but 
within the leadership overseeing transportation in our State.
  This is not just a Colorado issue. It is a regional one. Colorado is 
part of the Department of Transportation region 8, which includes 
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. If these issues 
persist in Colorado, how can we be certain they are not happening 
across the region? Competent leadership, from the regional director to 
the executive level, is critical to ensure that safety is not an 
afterthought, but a priority.
  Federal oversight must demand adherence to safety standards and hold 
agencies accountable for every dollar spent and every life put at risk.
  Today, I call on all lawmakers, transportation leaders, and community 
members to demand better and demand that Federal highway safety 
standards be followed to the letter. There is no excuse, no delay, and 
no corner worth cutting when lives are at stake. Every life matters, 
and every injury prevented is a victory for humanity.
  Together, we can ensure that our roads are places of safety, not 
sorrow. We owe it to every driver, every worker, and every family to 
make this a reality. There is no need for loss of life on our highways 
because we know better and because we can do better.

                              {time}  1100
                      WE ARE $35 TRILLION IN DEBT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. McCormick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I will take the time to talk about the 
biggest threat to our Nation, our ability to thrive as a nation and an 
economy.
  It is not really being addressed, even with the Herculean efforts of 
the DOGE and everybody else talking about what cuts we are going to 
make to the budget, which is around $7 trillion right now. We need to 
have a realistic conversation.
  We are $35 trillion in debt. We bring in less than $5 trillion per 
year to pay those debts and to pay for the entire budget. If we didn't 
have a budget, if we spent nothing on the United States, if we spent 
nothing for the military, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or 
anything in our budget, it would take us over 7 years to pay off our 
debt. That doesn't count the trillion dollars of interest we are paying 
right now per year.
  Let's have a realistic conversation. This problem is bipartisan. The 
real divergence of the debt-to-GDP ratio started about 2004, so about 
20 years ago. It happened when we had a Republican President, and it 
has continued regardless of who was in control of the Presidency--or 
the House or the Senate, for that matter.
  If we talk about the future, 75 percent of the budget is 
nondiscretionary. Some people call it mandatory, but we are Congress. 
There is nothing mandatory about spending. If we don't address these 
issues, we are in trouble as a nation. If we are out of balance and our 
debt-to-GDP ratio becomes too extreme, our currency will fail, and we 
will no longer hold the position we have in the world as an economic 
powerhouse.
  If you think that I am threatening Social Security, not at all. As a 
matter of fact, it is just the opposite. I want to secure it because, 
quite frankly, if we don't do something about Social Security, it will 
be insolvent in less than 10 years. It will take an automatic 21 
percent cut without a vote.
  We have no control over that, or we can, as Congress, say no we won't 
just print a whole bunch more money and saddle our children and 
grandchildren with that burden in the future and increase our debt 
ratio, again threatening our currency.
  If you think I am here to threaten Medicare, you are greatly 
mistaken. If we do nothing, within about a decade, it will be cut 
automatically by 11 percent, or we will have to make the emergency 
standard to print more money and, again, saddle our future generations 
with debt they cannot pay, debt that will saddle our economy, saddle 
our ability to function as a government, debt that will disrupt 
everything we know in America to be good: our abilities, our 
opportunities, all the things that make us thrive as a nation.
  As Coolidge famously said: The business of America is business. 
Business cannot thrive if we don't have American currency as the 
standard of the world.
  Therefore, I want us to have those serious conversations. I want us 
not to have those automatic cuts. I want to make sure that we do what 
we can to cut as much of the deficit spending as possible.
  Remember, a 30 percent deficit per year cannot be conquered just by 
one budget, but we have about 2 years to take this opportunity because, 
quite frankly, so many times I keep hearing my peers in this Congress 
talk about the things we need to give away. That comes at a cost, a 
cost to all Americans, and it doesn't matter if you are Republican or 
Democrat.
  We have to have real reform in not just our discretionary budget, 
which is only 25 percent of what we discuss, but we have to have an 
entire budgetary process that is bipartisan so we can have a solution 
for all Americans going forward.

                            SNAP REPLACEMENT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. McClellan) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the millions 
of Americans across the Nation who depend on SNAP benefits.
  In recent months, reports of SNAP benefit theft has skyrocketed at an 
alarming rate, leaving many families hungry. In the city of Richmond, 
Virginia, alone, there has been about a 2,000 percent increase in SNAP 
theft over the last month. Food banks are stepping up to meet the need, 
but they are seeing record numbers of families relying on their 
services as we enter the holiday season.
  Too many vulnerable families rely on SNAP to put food on the table. 
SNAP families often face precarious financial situations. When their 
benefits are stolen, they face the impossible choice of feeding their 
families or paying essential bills.
  As the children go hungry, they struggle to learn in school.
  This is not just an issue in our cities, but rural communities across 
the country are also facing SNAP benefit theft.
  Congress has empowered the States to use Federal funds to replace 
stolen benefits, which has helped ease this suffering, but that 
authority will expire on December 20 without additional action.
  That is why I am calling on House appropriators to extend this 
crucial authority through any funding bill that we pass and urge my 
colleagues to pass H.R. 205, the SNAP Theft Protection Act of 2023, 
introduced by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger).
  Hardworking families deserve to approach the holiday season with 
hope, not the looming fear of food insecurity. We must act swiftly to 
ensure that vulnerable communities are not left behind.

                          ____________________

         CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF THE HONORABLE MILDRED C. CRUMP

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Mrs. McIver) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the life of 
Honorable

[[Page H6373]]

Mildred C. Crump, a visionary leader and trailblazer from my beloved 
city of Newark, New Jersey, who passed away this past Sunday, December 
1, 2024.
  Mildred was a woman of many firsts. Her wisdom, guidance, and 
unwavering belief in justice helped shape my life and career and 
transformed the lives of so many others. As the first African-American 
woman elected to the Newark City Council and as the council's first 
woman president, Mildred broke barriers and demonstrated a steadfast 
commitment to equity, justice, and community empowerment.
  Her dedication to improving the lives of others, whether through her 
pioneering work as New Jersey's first African-American braille teacher 
or her tireless advocacy for housing, education, and civil rights, has 
left an everlasting mark on our city, State, and Nation.
  Council President Crump was more than a role model. She was a 
relentless advocate and champion for people and a brilliant community 
strategist. She blazed a path for so many and was always a source of 
unwavering support.
  For those of us who had the honor of learning from her, we are 
grateful for her. Mildred's leadership, compassion, and vision will be 
profoundly missed. All Newarkers mourn the loss of this exceptional 
woman.
  I send my deepest condolences to her children, Larry and Sheri, the 
rest of her family, and her loved ones.
  I know Mildred's legacy and impact will live on. It lives in me and 
many others.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mildred C. Crump on behalf of all the little 
Black and Brown girls she inspired and provided a light to shine. We 
will love her forever.

    RECOGNIZING AUSTIN AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO TREE 
                           LIGHTING CEREMONY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tonight is the beloved 
annual tradition of the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, and 
I rise to recognize the Austin Area School District's contributions to 
this display.
  The Austin Area School District in Potter County, Pennsylvania, is 
the smallest public school in Pennsylvania. The school serves 
approximately 180 prekindergarten through 12th grade students from the 
surrounding communities and excels in creating innovative, personalized 
one-on-one experiences for their students.
  This year, the Austin Area School District was selected to decorate 
the Pennsylvania tree, which is part of the Pathway of Peace, a display 
of 58 smaller trees representing each State, territory, and the 
District of Columbia.
  The National Park Foundation and the National Park Service annually 
present the National Christmas Tree lighting on the Ellipse at the 
White House and President's Park.
  This celebration began in 1923 and brings together families, friends, 
and communities to celebrate the holidays in one of America's national 
parks.
  With collaboration from the National Park Service, Department of 
Education, and National Park Foundation, local schools from each State 
decorate their trees with ornaments honoring their unique traditions 
and heritage.
  When tasked with creating ornaments for the trees, students were 
asked: ``What makes your State beautiful?'' Pennsylvania is rich in 
history and natural beauty, and Potter County has a distinctive 
lifestyle.
  Austin Area School District's art teacher, Mrs. Bethany Brown, and 
English teacher, Mrs. Megan Walck, had students create a list of what 
makes our region feel like home. Students considered Pennsylvania's 
outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, kayaking, camping, and 
stargazing, as well as historic events significant to Potter County.
  This attraction is open December 7 through January 1, and visitors 
viewing the Pennsylvania tree will see that our students showcase many 
unique attributes of Potter County.
  The ornaments highlight a variety of experiences unique to 
Pennsylvania, such as our number one industry, agriculture, and Potter 
County's rich history of potato farming. Local farms in Potter County 
supply potatoes nationwide. Maple syrup production thrives in our 
region thanks to the abundance of forests and maple trees. Each year, 
at the annual Maple Festival, the county celebrates the maple season 
with pancake breakfasts and open houses at maple producers' facilities. 
There are many more ornaments that showcase Pennsylvania's natural 
beauty.
  The Pennsylvania Wilds region is a remarkable resource for those 
eager to explore Pennsylvania's natural wonders. Unique attractions 
like the Coudersport Ice Mine, which produces ice even during the 
summer heat, add to the area's charm and are reflected in the students' 
ornament designs.
  Potter County serves as the source of major river systems, including 
the Allegheny River, which is also represented on the Pennsylvania 
State tree.
  Visitors will see that students also incorporated our State tree, 
flower, and various native animals into their design. The ornaments 
made by the Austin Area School District students promote some of Potter 
County's and Pennsylvania's proudest attractions.
  When reflecting on this experience, Austin Area School District 
student Breanna G. said: ``Having the opportunity to create a design 
that not only symbolizes me but my school and the area around me is so 
special. I feel so proud to have been given this chance, and I hope 
that someone will see this ornament and agree with the beauty of 
Pennsylvania's land. I am also thankful to my teacher, Mrs. Brown, for 
introducing us to this idea and letting us be as creative as we want. 
This is a project that I will remember for a very long time.''

  Participation in the arts is wonderful for a young person's 
development. It can inspire confidence that often extends far beyond 
the classroom. Teachers like Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Walck nurture 
creativity and play a valuable role in shaping curious minds.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Austin Area School District students, staff, 
and faculty for bringing Pennsylvania's Christmas spirit to our 
Nation's Capital and highlighting what makes Potter County such a 
special place to live and visit.
  Mr. Speaker, as Breanna G. so nicely quoted, it is an experience we 
will all remember for a very long time. I am incredibly proud of our 
students and their contributions to this cherished national tradition.

                          ____________________

                         PAC MONEY IN POLITICS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Khanna) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the unholy alliance 
between soulless wealth and power that is stripping away Americans' 
freedom.
  The reality is that, in 2024, 150 billionaires spent $1.9 billion on 
this election. Seventy-two percent of Americans--Republicans, 
Independents, and Democrats--are outraged with money in politics.
  We did not fight the Revolution to be spectators in a game of 
billionaires putting ads on our television sets and mobile phones.
  We have more dignity. We have more power as American citizens. Our 
Founders would be rolling over in their graves if they saw what has 
become of modern American democracy.
  There was $2.7 billion of super-PAC spending--and let me tell you 
something, only 1 percent of Americans gave more than $200. Who has 
more than $200 to give to politicians? The money has become more 
important than votes.
  Surely, we could agree in this body to ban super-PACs and overturn 
Citizens United. Short of that, surely we could agree with what Maine 
overwhelmingly did to restrict contributions to super-PACs. Why should 
it be that a politician can receive a contribution of only up to 
$3,300, but somehow super-PACs should be allowed to get millions of 
dollars?
  We need to make sure, like in Maine, in every State that, at the very 
least, super-PACs are restricted so billionaires aren't buying our 
elections. I founded the No PAC Caucus in the United States Congress. 
We need to end PAC money, the lobbyist money that is corrupting the 
soul of our democracy.

[[Page H6374]]

  


                              {time}  1115

  We may not agree on every issue, but when you look at why politicians 
sold our jobs overseas, why Wall Street raided our manufacturers and 
hollowed out industry after industry to worship shareholder profits, 
then you have to look at the influence billionaires have had on our 
democracy.
  Let's return power to our citizens. Let's ban super-PACs. Let's at 
least regulate billionaires from contributing to super-PACs. Let's ban 
Members from accepting PAC and lobbyist money. That will be worthy of 
our time in Congress.

                          ____________________

                 ONSHORING AUTO AND STEEL MANUFACTURING

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I hail from the manufacturing heart of 
automotive and truck USA, right at the Ohio-Michigan border. As this 
new year beckons, Congress must do what it can, as the old saying goes, 
to reconnect the U.S. head bone to its neck bone.
  Specifically, as co-chair of the House Auto Caucus, this means we 
must reshore ownership here in the USA of the Chrysler Group and its 
key suppliers. What America makes and grows here in America makes and 
grows America.
  The popular Jeep Wrangler, Ram truck, and the American steel that 
should go into them create two of the most popular purchased vehicles 
in our country and world. Just these two vehicles represent a major 
manufacturing sector for our heartland that was traded away by Wall 
Street to Europe.
  As a result, thousands upon thousands of skilled workers at 
production platforms in Toledo, Ohio; Sterling Heights, Michigan; and 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, are now being idled before the holidays.
  Why is it always right before the holidays?
  Meanwhile, the purveyors of vast wealth actually harm the workers 
that create the very wealth that benefit those billionaires. The 
ownership of the production was moved to Europe, and their billionaire 
enablers and buddies on Wall Street from the world of high finance keep 
trading away their livelihoods.
  America's truck, automobile, steel, and auto parts manufacturing 
workers have had enough. They deserve respect.
  Wouldn't the holiday season be happier if Congress could reassure 
thousands and thousands of Jeep and Ram workers a better future?
  The current Jeep Stellantis CEO, Carlos Tavares, is stepping down. He 
lives in Europe. After his dreadful 10 years as leader of this lodestar 
automobile company that was created in this country, he earns a 
whopping $43 million a year, not counting all his perks and stock 
options. He just got another million-dollar raise. After his dreadful--
I can't even call it leadership--heading the company, he just got 
rewarded that additional million dollars. Meanwhile, workers in Toledo 
and Sterling Heights get pink-slipped and hit the unemployment lines. 
How cruel. This has to stop.
  Production pauses were announced just before Thanksgiving as we head 
into the holiday season. That is downright un-American.

  It is long overdue for America to be American again. Wall Street 
traders should bring back ownership of Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge to the 
United States of America. It is overdue to put real car builders in 
charge, not Wall Street traders nor hapless CEOs from another country.
  The outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump 
administration must direct attention to what is occurring right at the 
Ohio-Michigan border. This region is the heart of the industrial 
Midwest, where people make and build our real wealth, not just trade it 
away.
  Our people don't live in virtual reality or stock options. We live in 
places where iron sharpens iron--some might say the agony and the 
ecstasy of producing America's real wealth. Yet we have seen it traded 
away time and again, decade after decade as oligarchs and billionaires 
who could care less about America get richer off the sweat of our 
people.
  This is a wake-up call for the current and future President of the 
United States. Hear our call. Reshore ownership of our Chrysler-Jeep-
Dodge platform, both in the automotive and trucking industry. Lift up 
the industrial heartland of America.
  As we reshore the ownership and production of our Nation's most 
popular vehicles, we also ensure that those who own the means of 
production have to live in the same reality as those who build these 
cars and trucks.
  Both Presidents Trump and Biden have said America should stop the 
sale of U.S. Steel to Japanese Nippon Steel. I agree with that. 
Americans who are potential buyers wait in the wings. Engage them. 
Include those that forge quality steel that is a critical component of 
both our rugged Rams and Jeeps.
  American steel in American cars, doesn't that sound good?
  My hope for the USA is that we reclaim ownership of what we created 
in the first place. Our workers know it. They have surely earned it. 
The future of generations across our industrial heartland and Nation 
depends on America restoring America again. What America makes and 
builds makes and builds America. Bring Jeep and Ram back to the United 
States of America.

                        HONORING MAYOR ED HONEA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
the life and legacy of my friend, Marana Mayor Ed Honea, who passed 
away unexpectedly on November 22nd.
  One of southern Arizona's most influential leaders, Ed was a pillar 
of his community who dedicated himself to serving the residents of 
Marana with steadfast resolve and a genuine passion.
  A third-generation resident of Marana, Ed's roots ran deep in the 
community he served and loved so very much. Ed graduated from Marana 
High School and went on to serve his country during the Vietnam war as 
a member of the Navy and he was a lifetime member of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Post 5990 in Marana.
  For Ed, politics was never an end to itself. He was deeply driven by 
his desire to make tangible improvements in his community. His career 
in public service spanned 37 years, across 3 terms on the town council, 
including serving as mayor since 2005. He was very committed to 
improving transportation infrastructure, strengthening public safety, 
and promoting economic growth in Marana and across the region.
  He often reminded me and, quite frankly, everyone around him that he 
started calling me Congressman way before I even decided to go for this 
job.
  I am deeply proud of the strong Federal-local partnership Ed and I 
built to benefit our constituents. In total, we worked together to 
preliminarily direct over $4 million in Federal funding in Marana.
  However, it was more than just a mayor-Congressman relationship. To 
both of us, it was just two friends working together for our 
communities.
  Ed's legacy of servant leadership will have a positive impact in his 
community long into the future.
  Laura and I will continue to keep his family, friends, and loved ones 
in our thoughts and prayers.
  As we remember Mayor Ed Honea, let us honor his memory by continuing 
the work he was so passionate about, building stronger communities and 
helping each other succeed. I will surely miss my friend.

                RECOGNIZING UNITED INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, before I got into the political arena, I was 
in the family construction and development business. It was seldom that 
I ever heard of or witnessed a company that stayed in business for 20, 
50, or 70 years, and especially not 100 years.
  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate United Infrastructure Group, a 
South Carolina company that has done just that. It has been a 
successful business

[[Page H6375]]

for 100 years, performing outstanding work in engineering, 
construction, alternative project delivery, and service.
  United Infrastructure Group, or UIG, was founded in 1924 by Frederick 
Triplett as a partnership named Small and Triplett Construction 
Company. The company began construction of its first bridge in 
Morristown, Tennessee, then continued in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and 
the two Carolinas.
  The company completed its first major bridge project in 1926 in 
Chester County, South Carolina, carrying SC-9 over the Catawba River to 
replace the existing ferry. For the next 20 years before his death, 
Frederick served as a pioneer in the bridge construction industry. His 
legacy continues in his two sons, Fred and Tom.
  An innovator and inventor, Fred graduated from Clemson College in 
1948 with a civil engineering degree and began working in his father's 
business. He was known for designing and building overhead gantry 
cranes used on bridge projects during the 1950s and the 1960s.
  In 1976, he was named Employer of the Year for South Carolina for 
modifying a crane with hand controls to assist a disabled veteran and a 
former crane operator.
  His other son, Tom, like his father, was respected by his 
contemporaries for his contributions to the construction industry and 
local, State, and Federal organizations, but one of his most memorable 
characteristics was being an avid American patriot. His legacy lives on 
with his son, Jim Triplett, who is an American patriot in his own right 
and is the current chief executive officer of the United Infrastructure 
Group, Inc.
  Many in the industry regard Jim as a top professional in his field 
and one who has had a major impact on the highway industry in the 
Carolinas as a leader in bridge construction and design-build delivery 
for over 30 years. He began working for his father at age 9 in 1974. He 
received his bachelor of science in computer engineering from Clemson 
University in 1986. He practiced structural engineering with Ralph 
Whitehead & Associates until 1992, when he returned to work at United 
Contractors. In 1995, Jim acquired the majority interest of the company 
and later acquired several other former Triplett companies to unify the 
companies into a single entity.

  The United Infrastructure Group prides itself on fostering growth and 
diversity in resources and disciplines by developing and motivating 
exceptional leaders in a Christian environment to achieve excellence by 
every standard of measure. Their commitment to not only producing 
excellent work but excellent people has left a lasting impact on South 
Carolina. The growth of their family business represents the heartbeat 
of the American Dream.
  On behalf of the Fifth District of South Carolina, it is my most 
sincere pleasure to recognize the United Infrastructure Group for 100 
years of outstanding service. The United Infrastructure Group and the 
Triplett family have set the gold standard, a century of dedicated 
service and commitment for which they will long be remembered. For 
that, I hope you will all join me in celebrating this momentous 
occasion.

                   TEN YEARS OF SPENDING DYSFUNCTION

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to stand before you 
today as I reflect on my one decade of service representing West 
Virginia's Second Congressional District in the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
  Over these 10 years, I have fought relentlessly to uphold the core 
conservative values that brought me to this Chamber, including securing 
our southern border, defending the Second Amendment, pro-life, and 
reining in the reckless spending of our tax dollars in Washington. 
Today, I want to focus on that last point, our government's 
unsustainable spending habits.

                              {time}  1130

  Mr. Speaker, spending comes in two primary categories: mandatory and 
discretionary. Mandatory spending, which includes programs like 
Medicare and Social Security, occurs automatically, and it accounts for 
two-thirds of our Federal budget. To change these programs, Congress 
must act deliberately.
  On the other hand, discretionary spending must be approved annually 
by Congress and fund the vital operations of Federal agencies like the 
Department of Defense.
  The most fundamental responsibility of this body is to fund our 
government in a responsible manner and on time to 12 single-subject 
appropriations bills. Let me emphasize that: responsibly and on time. 
It is called the power of the purse, which the Constitution of the 
United States of America specifically gives only to this Chamber, the 
U.S. House of Representatives.
  It is designed to protect the separation of powers so the President 
and the administration doesn't just do whatever they want with out-of-
control regulations. In my State it was a war on coal, a war on guns, 
and onerous regulations that go after farmers and the construction 
industry. By passing the discretionary appropriations bills like we are 
supposed to, we can rein that in and stop it. That is our job. We 
should not delegate that or give that up.
  As I wrap up my 10th year here in Congress, let's take a hard look at 
how we have handled spending over that time. When I was sworn in, in 
January of 2015, the national debt stood at about $18 trillion. Today, 
it has doubled that and stands at $36 trillion. Worse still, the United 
States now spends more on interest for our debt than the entire annual 
defense budget which is $822 billion.
  Frankly, this is an astonishing failure of the responsibility of 
Congress on both sides of the aisle. This out-of-control and growing 
debt is a failure to live up to the mandate we were elected to fulfill.
  Congress has chosen to abandon the basic function of passing timely 
spending bills. We have an entire year to prepare, negotiate, debate, 
and pass these 12 bills, but too often we just don't do it. In my 10 
years in Congress, on this chart in red, Congress has passed 34 
temporary stopgap measures known as continuing resolutions. One is 
coming up next week because we did not do our work. By doing that, we 
surrender the power of the purse.
  In the entire span of my service here in Congress, just two times, in 
2 years, in 2017 and 2019, Congress passed the spending bills on time. 
In 2017, we passed only one. In 2019, we passed five. We saw a partial 
government shutdown because Democrats refused to help President Trump 
secure the border.
  Each time we fail to pass spending bills on time, we kick the can 
down the road and leave the American people with bloated omnibus 
packages that are, frankly, an insult to the responsible budgeting that 
our Nation deserves.
  When we do pass it, the game is the Senate Democrats essentially 
filibuster it, causing a government shutdown and trying to blame the 
House Republicans for it. This is political bullying. We need to stand 
up to this tactic. It is just not right.
  The American people gave Republicans a resounding mandate for change. 
We have been entrusted with unified control of government, and that 
means one thing: cutting wasteful spending and doing our jobs on time. 
It is another travesty for Members of Congress to continue to vote for 
reckless, unsustainable spending when it is our children and our 
grandchildren who will bear the burden of this debt long after we are 
gone.
  I was actually a Hill staffer here in 1994 in the Republican 
Revolution. In 1995, Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House. We 
passed all 12 single-subject spending bills like we were supposed to. 
We actually did it. It has only been in the last 20 to 25 years in this 
country where we failed to do that. From George Washington and the 
founding of America until about 20 years ago, standard process was to 
actually pass our spending bills.
  What we are doing now is weird. It is wrong. It is not normal at all. 
It is because of these bullying tactics from the Senate because they 
get what they want. If they shut down government and try to blame us 
and we cave in, they get everything they want: no border security, 
transsexual sex change operations in the military. They get everything 
they want if they try to

[[Page H6376]]

shut down government. We must stand up to this.
  To the Members of the incoming 119th Congress, which I will no longer 
be a part of, it is time to control spending and reclaim that power of 
the purse before it is too late.

             PRESSING ISSUES FOR AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESSES

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we know that small businesses are really 
the cornerstone of the American economy. Entry-level jobs and the 
corner mom-and-pop stores are what really make a town, a small town, or 
a neighborhood work well. Yet, the regulations that are being heaped 
upon them make it just about impossible for them to go much further to 
remain in business. Year after year there are more costs, more 
paperwork, more things that just make it more enticing to retire or go 
out of business.
  Federal regulations play a big part in that. In my home State of 
California, State regulations heaped upon them play a big role, as 
well. So what do we get? Some of the bad ideas that come out of 
California are emulated here.
  We had a bill called AB5, also known as the ABC worker classification 
rules. What happens? That starts affecting what they call gig workers 
or people who are contractors but they are trying to corral them into 
being employees mainly so they can be unionized. That isn't it at all.
  Then what happens? AB5 passes in California and messes things up for 
a while. They have to pass another law to straighten out some part of 
it including things like Uber rides and Lyft and things like that. They 
got an exemption for them. There are a lot of other people who have not 
gotten that exemption.

  In D.C., in Congress, after watching that mess, after having 
something at least partially corrected that didn't work well, they 
wanted to emulate that with something called the PRO Act here last 
Congress. They want to keep on adding more and more to that burden.
  What we see, again, in my home State of California is our resources 
board came up with more and more emissions rules on vehicles. We are 
not talking about being against clean air and having more efficient 
vehicles. That comes from the marketplace. It comes from technology 
advancing, as it can, instead of State mandates saying that we will 
just force you to electrify all vehicles by 2035 or 2040 or 2045 or 
whatever round number fits the narrative that day for a date and time.
  We see that CARB is just choking off so much for small businesses and 
for trucking. Trucking is essential to get finished products to the 
store shelves and so much of the inputs to a farm or to a factory, for 
example.
  A lot of times a ship will bring things into port. A train might move 
it a long way or the truck might move it directly to where it is needed 
in manufacturing or processing and then it is brought to your store 
shelves.
  Well, those prices just keep going up because they force more and 
more mandates on trucks and on locomotives. The technology doesn't even 
exist or certainly hasn't been perfected yet on those diesel engines. 
Diesel does power the country, like it or not. It will do so for a 
long, long time.
  The mandates that they place at CARB are making it so much more 
expensive. At some point we might have to go a few weeks without food 
and other issues, other supplies being on the shelves to finally get 
the point across that truckers can't do it anymore in my home State.
  You see what farmers go through with trying to comply with water 
supply issues where more and more water is being pushed toward 
environmental water and less toward farming and growing food in my home 
State.
  The San Joaquin Valley has been devastated over 2 years with the 
water being taken away and flushed out to the delta. It supposedly 
helped something called the delta smelt or so-called saltwater 
intrusion coming up to the bay and salting the water that gets farther 
inland.
  They don't need nearly the amount of water that is wasted and is 
going through the delta and out to the ocean to take care of some of 
those problems.
  Indeed, the municipalities around the delta need to look at how much 
effluent they are putting into the delta, into that estuary, or into 
the ocean directly by not having cleaned up their act with the effluent 
coming out of the sewer treatment plant, sometimes just straight sewer. 
The regulations are needed on the city folks and not on the farmers and 
not taking away the water.
  What I am talking about is that these small businesses like farms, 
like downtown, like trucking companies, like all that are being 
devastated by regulations. A lot of them start in my home State of 
California but then are emulated here in Washington, D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, so often it seems that one hasn't even talked to the 
other about how the rules would be effective, how they would actually 
be devastating, or how they would be implemented in a way that isn't 
hurtful.
  Government is supposed to help the people. Government is supposed to 
help people whether they are the ones being protected by these so-
called polluters or the ones who need to receive the products that they 
are making. Business is a big part of that.
  If we don't allow these people to be in business, then those jobs 
will be exported. We will import everything from China at lower 
quality. We need relief from that at the Federal level, as well as the 
State level, from this regulatory overreach.

EDUCATION DEPARTMENT'S SEVERE, REPEATED AUDIT FAILURES ARE EMBARRASSING

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the Biden-Harris Education Department has once 
again failed America's hardworking taxpayers.
  For 3 years in a row, the Education Department failed its audit. In 
other words, the Education Department has been unable to manage 
effectively, efficiently, or with any sense of accuracy the resources 
entrusted to it.
  Accuracy, transparency, and consistency are critical when it comes to 
managing finances. The Education Department has taken a different 
approach. Its student loan data was full of errors, and it made up 
estimates it could not defend to its auditor.
  Bungling and bad budgeting appear to be the Education Department's 
blueprint. I can't tell if this is due to general ineptness or 
deliberate wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars, but I can tell you it 
is an embarrassment. The American people deserve better.

                       RECOGNIZING AARON POINTER

  (Ms. STRICKLAND asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and 
service of Aaron Pointer, who is retiring from the Metro Parks Tacoma 
board after more than 20 years of service.
  During his career in professional sports and public service, Aaron 
has broken records and barriers and expanded recreation opportunities 
in Pierce County.
  While growing up in Oakland, California, Aaron was passionate about 
all sports and played basketball and baseball at the University of San 
Francisco.
  In 1961, he signed a contract with the Houston Colt .45s, which is 
today known as the Astros. Aaron was often the only Black player on the 
team and faced prejudice and discrimination, including being forced to 
eat, travel, and stay in lodging separate from his White teammates.
  Despite this, Aaron broke records on the field and became the last 
pro baseball player to hit over .400.
  After retiring as a player, Aaron continued his exceptional career in 
sports through officiating football. He was the first Black official in 
the Pac-10 Conference, and in 1978, he became an NFL referee, where he 
officiated for 17 years.
  He empowered the next generation of athletes with Pierce County 
Parks, where he supervised sports leagues and athletics for young 
people. He has also been a longtime member of the Tacoma Pierce County 
Black Collective, working for more equitable education, healthcare, and 
economic opportunity for the Black community.
  I am so proud to recognize Aaron for his impactful career at the 
highest levels of professional sports, and I thank him for his years of 
service to our community.

            RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
importance of our Nation's correctional officers.
  The correctional officers at the Bureau of Prisons facilities across 
my district and nationwide are the backbone of our correctional 
systems. These dedicated professionals work tirelessly and are critical 
to maintaining safety and security within our Federal correctional 
facilities and detention centers.
  Unfortunately, the Bureau of Prisons has faced unprecedented 
challenges in recruiting and retaining correctional staff. Multiple BOP 
facilities in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District are 
understaffed by at least 20 percent of their authorized levels.
  Under current law, these essential workers may not receive pay during 
a government shutdown. Uncertainty over when the next paycheck will 
arrive should not exacerbate the staffing shortages and difficult 
conditions of working in a prison environment.
  Yesterday, I introduced the Keep our Correctional Officers Paid Act, 
which would guarantee that correctional officers who are required to 
show up to work every day of the year continue to receive a paycheck in 
the event of a government shutdown.
  Mr. Speaker, this crucial legislation recognizes the unwavering, 
dedicated work of correction officers in ensuring public safety and 
provides the Bureau of Prisons' staff with certainty. I urge my 
colleagues to support this critical legislation.

             INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge International 
Day of Persons with Disabilities, which is observed annually on 
December 3.
  Mr. Speaker, 1 in 4, approximately 70 million, adults in the United 
States report having a disability. In the Virgin Islands, my home, 
approximately 10,000 people report having a disability.
  Despite significant progress within the disability rights movement, 
in December 2022, 40 percent of adults with disabilities reported 
experiencing unfair treatment and discrimination.
  As elected officials and legislators, we have a special 
responsibility to advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities. 
We must pass legislation that supports their right to affordable, 
accessible, and quality housing; educational opportunities; healthcare; 
technology services; transportation; and rights of work.
  We must continuously champion policies that improve and make the 
world a more equitable place for all Americans.
  Today and every day, I remain dedicated to creating a barrier-free 
world that values the diversity and uniqueness of each individual.

                       RECOGNIZING YOUNG ATHLETES

  (Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize all the young 
athletes from Wisconsin's Seventh District who competed in the 2024 
Wisconsin football State championships.
  I congratulate the Owen-Withee Blackhawks on winning the program's 
first-ever State championship, the Edgar Wildcats and Coach Jerry Sinz 
on winning the Division 7 State championship title for the second year 
in a row, and the Stratford Tigers on winning the Division 5 State 
championship title for the third year in a row, setting a WIAA State 
record with their 10th State football title in school history.
  I also wish Stratford's head coach, Jason Tubbs, all the best in 
retirement after 13 seasons with the Tigers.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all of these athletes and their coaches 
on an incredible season.

                  THANKING REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE LESKO

  (Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and 
celebrate the leadership and commitment of my good friend, 
Congresswoman Debbie Lesko from the great State of Arizona, for her 16 
years of public service in the Arizona House of Representatives, the 
Arizona Senate, and now the United States House of Representatives.
  As chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have witnessed 
Congresswoman Debbie Lesko as a fierce advocate for her district and a 
real ally in advocating for American technological and energy 
leadership. She has also served as our Oversight and Investigations 
Subcommittee vice chair.
  Her spirit and determination have made our committee and the House of 
Representatives as a whole a better place.
  I look forward to seeing Congresswoman Lesko succeed in her new role, 
and I know she will bring that same

[[Page H6378]]

spirit and determination to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors.

                   MOURNING THE LOSS OF KIRK SCHURING

  (Mr. RULLI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today before you to shine light on the 
recent passing of my dear friend, mentor, and colleague, Kirk Schuring, 
a true giant amongst men and known around the State as the legislators' 
legislator.
  He passed away on November 22, 2024, following a courageous battle 
with cancer.
  Kirk Schuring was my mentor. He was the finest thing that ever came 
from Ohio. Being green, getting into the Ohio Senate, he mentored me as 
the chair of small business, and then I became chair for 4 years of 
government. When I was chair, he taught me how to really do policy. He 
also told me that every voice in Ohio must have a voice.
  He was proud of doing hard work in policy and doing amendments so all 
Ohioans could be represented. That was his point of focus, to do policy 
work, the hard, heavy lifting that most people will never see.
  Some of his accomplishments were he allocated $7 million for the 
jump-start of the expansion of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, 
Ohio. He was instrumental in getting $50 million from the brand-new 
movie of ``Superman'' that was filmed in Cleveland, Ohio.
  He was an advocate of the Canton Urban League, the Stark County Young 
Republicans, the Canton Jaycees, and a lot more than that.
  Kirk Schuring will be missed. He was a dear friend, and Ohio is 
better that he existed.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak about my 
mentor.

                          DISASTER TAX PACKAGE

  (Ms. TOKUDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I share Representative LaMalfa's 
appreciation that last night the Senate finally unanimously passed the 
bipartisan Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act, sending it to the 
President's desk.
  This bill includes language that I introduced over a year ago to help 
Maui fire victims deduct their disaster-related losses and keep money 
in their pockets. This bill will also exempt wildfire disaster 
settlement payments from being taxed.
  As Maui and other fire-impacted communities across the country focus 
on their recoveries, they deserve certainty that the financial relief 
they receive will go entirely to them and to their ``family,'' 
``ohana.''
  For months, this bill and the financial relief it provides to our 
Maui ``family,'' ``ohana,'' have been among my top priorities in 
Congress. I am proud to have been part of a majority in the House in 
signing a discharge petition, forcing a vote on this bill, and passing 
it overwhelmingly back in May, where it has remained with the Senate.
  I am grateful to have been part of this bipartisan effort with my 
friends: Congressmen Greg Steube, Doug LaMalfa, and   Mike Thompson. 
While this has been a long journey together, I am proud we have gotten 
this over the finish line, and I hope President Biden will sign this 
bill into law as soon as possible.

                   KEEP COMMUNISM OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, there are 
over 500 schools in the United States that are subverted with Chinese 
Communist Party propaganda. The endorsement of communism in American 
classrooms has led to a disgusting 28 percent of young adults who have 
a favorable opinion of communism, and another 19 percent believe that a 
dictatorship is the best political system.
  American families must stand up against Communist atrocities and 
support democracy, which is why this week House Republicans will 
consider the Crucial Communism Teaching Act, introduced by the 
courageous Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar. This bill will provide 
truthful curriculum to students about the failures of communism and 
totalitarianism.
  House Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will safeguard 
democracy and not allow communist infiltration.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent, as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstate 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.

                              UNFAIR TAXES

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Senate finally passed the 
Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act which includes in that my own bill to 
stop taxing wildfire survivors after they received damages and after 
everything has been burned out in Paradise, California, and several 
other northern California fires in recent years.
  The IRS has treated disaster relief like a payday for themselves, 
taking from the survivors who have already lost so much. Now that ends.
  This bill ensures wildfire victims will keep their settlement funds, 
money they need to rebuild their own lives. It also stops the unfair 
taxes on legal fees. Get this, Mr. Speaker, they have to pay the taxes 
on the fees that the attorneys would get when they cut their 30, 33 
percent out of those award damages. It also restores their lost wages, 
taxes, and other recovery costs.
  Taxpayers can claim refunds for taxes wrongly paid since 2020, 
putting over $500 million back where it belongs: with the people.
  This isn't just dollars and cents. It is about doing what is right 
for those facing disaster.
  After years of work, I am really glad to see this legislation can 
finally clear both Houses of Congress and get these folks the relief 
they have needed for so long after nearly being disaster victims of 
wildfire.

  (Mrs. LESKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of my 
staff, Justin Camp, for his dedication and service to myself and the 
constituents of Arizona's Eighth Congressional District.
  A native of California, Justin joined my staff as a legislative 
correspondent and worked his way up to becoming a legislative 
assistant. Justin is a committed team member who has the important job 
of communicating our work to our constituents and overseeing a 
legislative portfolio that includes education and social issues.
  I thank Justin for his hard work and dedication to me, our team, and 
the constituents in Arizona.
  As I leave Congress, I have no doubt Justin will go on to do great 
things as he continues his public service. I wish him nothing but the 
best in all of his future endeavors.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Justin.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. THOMAS CORK, SR.

  (Mr. McGARVEY asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, legacy, 
and service of Mr. Thomas Cork, Sr., a United States Marine Corps 
veteran from my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, who recently passed 
away at 95 years old.
  In 1948, Thomas Cork left Louisville to serve our country as a 
Montford Point marine, making history as part of the first group of 
Black men to enlist in the Marine Corps.
  As part of the famous 1st Marine Division, his bravery and service 
directly

[[Page H6379]]

helped lead to the end of the Korean war. However, like many other 
Black veterans, when he returned home, he wasn't given the reverence he 
earned.
  We are trying to atone for that. Today, as we honor his life and 
service, I want to express our gratitude on behalf of all those who 
didn't and should have.
  Thomas Cork, Sr., is an American hero who fought two battles, in the 
Pacific and on the home front.
  His legacy will live on for generations to come, and we thank him for 
his service.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER JESSE BRANCH

  (Mr. STAUBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay my 
respects to Red Lake Police Officer Jesse Branch, who was killed in a 
car crash last week while responding to a call for service.
  At just 18 years old, Jesse committed himself to a career in law 
enforcement, starting as a corrections officer with the Red Lake 
Detention Center and eventually becoming a police officer.
  During his 17 years in law enforcement, Jesse earned the reputation 
as a man of integrity who was dedicated to the well-being and safety of 
his community.
  Even though Jesse's life was tragically cut short, the positive 
impact he had on the Red Lake Nation will be remembered for generations 
to come.
  Minnesota thanks him for his selfless service and sacrifice. My 
prayers are with his family, friends, colleagues, and all those who 
loved him.

                        REMEMBERING OMER NEUTRA

  (Mr. MOLINARO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Omer Neutra who 
deferred his enrollment at Binghamton University in my district to join 
the Israel Defense Forces. He had been missing since October 7, 2023, 
in the barbaric attacks committed against Israel and Israeli citizens 
by Hamas.
  After fighting for over a year for his return, his parents received 
the news no parent should ever hear: Omer was killed on October 7 by 
Hamas terrorists.
  The monsters who did this, and, yes, they are monsters, are still out 
there. We are not done fighting. With our support, Israel will overcome 
Hamas and win its war, and at home we will win our war against anti-
Semitism.
  We will win by shining a light on bigotry and calling out those who 
sympathize with terrorists, the people who, while Omer's family lived 
in agony, stood on college campuses hurling insults at Jewish students 
and leading anti-Semitic chants like ``from the river to the sea.''
  Our hearts and prayers go out to Omer's family, his friends, and the 
Binghamton campus. His life and memory will forever be a blessing, and 
the pain he endured will be motivation to keep fighting for justice.

           RECOGNIZING KEVIN BOYLE OF BROADVIEW HEIGHTS, OHIO

  (Mr. MILLER of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kevin 
Boyle of Broadview Heights, Ohio.
  Kevin came to America through adoption from El Salvador after his mom 
met him there while she did mission work there.
  Kevin was very sick and had significant disabilities. The Boyles 
already had another child, Courtney, who herself had disabilities and 
significant medical needs. With great faith, they pursued adopting 
Kevin from a country that adopts out less than 10 kids per year.
  After 4 years of waiting, in 2013, Kevin came home to Cleveland as an 
18-pound 9-year-old. Yes, he was 18 pounds at 9 years old.
  With great American medical care, he very quickly became chubby, 
silly, and full of life.
  As an upstanding citizen of northeast Ohio, Kevin exercised his right 
to vote for the first time in the 2024 Presidential election.
  Today, I celebrate Kevin for this milestone event. This is an 
incredible story to be shared around the country. What a victory.

  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1602, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 7198) to amend title 5, United States Code, to 
require greater transparency for Federal regulatory decisions that 
impact small businesses, and for other purposes, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Norman). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1602, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill is adopted and the

                             General Leave

  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7198.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Wyoming?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 
2024.
  This is an important bipartisan piece of legislation that will help 
small businesses around the country comply with the overwhelming weight 
of Federal regulation.
  It is no secret that small businesses around the United States face 
an uphill battle when complying with Federal regulations. Many 
regulations cause significant economic impacts on these small 
businesses.

                              {time}  1230

  When small businesses are forced to shoulder the burden of these 
regulations, it results in higher prices at the cash register. It also 
can keep some small businesses out of the market altogether. Rather 
than facing a mountain of regulation and compliance

[[Page H6381]]

costs, some would-be small business owners may never achieve their 
dream of opening a small business.
  Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agencies that make these 
damaging regulations are supposed to take small businesses into account 
when writing the rules. All too often, however, the agencies are out of 
compliance with the RFA's mandates.
  One report actually found that, in 75 percent of the rulemakings, the 
agencies either ignored costs on small businesses, or underestimated 
the regulations costs. H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 2024, would 
strengthen the RFA's already-existing provisions and make it so that 
agencies have a much harder time skirting their statutory obligations 
to our country's small businesses.
  The Prove It Act of 2024 allows small businesses to petition the 
Small Business Administration to investigate a rulemaking process when 
a small business owner believes the agency inadequately performed its 
regulatory analysis as required by the RFA. It also authorizes the 
SBA's chief advocacy counsel to independently investigate a rulemaking 
agency's compliance with the RFA. Finally, it creates a penalty for 
rulemaking agencies that failed to comply with the RFA's requirements.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may claim that this bill 
is only an attempt to slow down the agency rulemaking, making it more 
difficult for the Federal Government to oversee the economy. This is 
incorrect.
  There are no provisions in this bill that are designed to slow down 
rulemaking. In fact, the only thing that may slow down an agency's 
rulemaking endeavor is having to fully comply with the law as it is 
already written. The RFA was passed in 1980. Yet, there are still 
agencies which do not take the specific needs of small businesses into 
account when crafting regulations.
  If Federal regulators followed the law as Congress intended, the 
legislation before us would not be necessary. Unfortunately, Federal 
regulators have been delinquent in their obligations to American small 
business owners.
  H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 2024, is a bipartisan effort to force 
regulators to comply with existing statutes and consider small business 
owners when crafting legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act, represents the latest 
effort by Republicans to dismantle the regulatory process, giving well-
resourced special interests a powerful new cudgel to wield against 
regulations, while causing harm to the very small entities the bill 
purports to help.
  This legislation would vest enormous and unreviewable authority over 
agency rules to the chief counsel of the Office of Advocacy within the 
Small Business Administration, a chronically underfunded office that 
has not even had a Senate-confirmed leader since 2017.
  It authorizes the chief counsel, unilaterally and without review, to 
exempt large parts of the business community from proposed rules if he 
or she determines that an agency did not properly consider how a 
proposed rule would affect small entities.
  Not only would this broad and vaguely defined authority apply to 
proposed regulations, but the bill would also charge the chief counsel 
with tracking agencies' completion of mandatory reviews of existing 
rules every 10 years. If they find that an agency failed to conduct the 
required review of the rule, they can simply suspend operation of the 
rule.
  I note that, while this legislation would impose significant new 
burdens on the SBA, it would provide no additional funding to carry out 
these duties, putting a further strain on the agency's ability to 
assist small businesses.
  Our public agencies are responsible for writing rules that protect 
our community from harm. They make sure that the toys our children play 
with are safe. They make sure that the vehicles we drive and the 
buildings we live in are up to code. They make sure that the 
legislation we pass in Congress for tackling issues like climate change 
and public health are implemented as we intend.
  The Prove It Act would grind all of this to a halt. Rules that would 
ban toxic chemicals or take contaminated food out of the market would 
hang in limbo while petitions mount before this single official to 
complete his or her reviews, if he or she can ever complete them at 
all.

  This bill is not about lessening the burden on small businesses. By 
law, agencies already must take small businesses into account. These 
small entities already have power through the Office of Advocacy to 
champion their concerns, so the bill is entirely unnecessary if that 
was truly the purpose of the bill.
  In reality, this bill is about giving big businesses the ability to 
shut down the regulatory process. Any group that merely purports to 
represent small businesses, no matter how large or well-resourced they 
may be, could petition this one official to block a pending rule they 
do not like. There would be no limit to how many times they do this. 
This is a recipe for chaos and dysfunction. That, of course, is the 
point.
  Republicans do not want to empower the agencies that ensure the drugs 
we take are safe, that ensure child car seats protect the most 
vulnerable among us, and that enforce our competition laws to ensure 
that small businesses have a chance to thrive. They want to throw sand 
in the gears of these agencies to ensure that they never issue the 
regulations we depend on to keep us safe.
  This bill would do little to help small businesses, but it could 
prove to be a windfall for powerful companies and special interests. It 
is no surprise, therefore, that this legislation is right out of the 
Project 2025 playbook, which calls for ``supercharging'' the Office of 
Advocacy at the SBA so the entity can ``dismantle extreme regulatory 
policies and advance limited-government reforms.''
  Republicans are so determined to carry out this dismantling of the 
regulatory process that they are even willing to violate their own 
House rules against legislation that will increase mandatory spending, 
ignoring a CBO estimate that the bill would add millions of dollars to 
the deficit.
  We all want to ensure that small businesses can thrive, but this bill 
would not help them. Instead, it would create uncertainty and chaos 
while giving big businesses a new tool to dismantle the regulatory 
process that protects public health and safety and that protects 
consumers from rising costs.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score for 
this bill.

       The bill would:
       Allow small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and small 
     local governments to request that the Small Business 
     Administration (SBA) review a certification that a proposed 
     rule would not have a significant economic effect on a 
     substantial number of such small entities

     the issuing agency fails to review that rule periodically

       Requiring some federal agencies to devote staff to meet new 
     analysis and reporting requirements

     agencies and the Federal Reserve System to carry out 
     provisions of the bill
       Bill summary: H.R. 7198 would allow small businesses, 
     nonprofit organizations, and small local governments to 
     request that the Small Business Administration (SBA) review 
     federal agencies' certifications that proposed rules would 
     not significantly affect a substantial number of small 
     entities. The bill would require the SBA to establish a 
     process for reviewing those requests and determining whether 
     certifications merit further review. (Federal agencies 
     currently evaluate proposed rules' economic effects on small 
     entities and either certify that a rule would not 
     significantly affect them or they prepare a detailed 
     regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule. A regulatory 
     flexibility analysis is an assessment of a proposed 
     regulation on small entities.)
       If further review is required, the SBA would consult the 
     rulemaking agency, representatives of the small entities, and 
     the Office of Management and Budget to determine whether, in 
     place of a certification, the rulemaking agency must prepare 
     a regulatory flexibility analysis. If the agency does not 
     complete that process, the final rule would not apply to 
     small entities.
       Additionally, under the bill, if an agency fails to update 
     its analysis of a rule's effect on small entities within 10 
     years of the rule taking effect, as they are required to do 
     under current law, the rule would no longer be in effect. 
     That provision would apply to rules for which agencies should 
     have provided updated analysis within the 5-year period prior 
     to the bill's enactment. Under the bill, a rulemaking agency 
     could seek to reinstate a rule by carrying out a new 
     rulemaking process.
       Estimated Federal cost: The costs of the legislation, 
     detailed in Table 1, fall within multiple budget functions.
       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 
     7198 will be enacted near the end of calendar year 2024, that 
     the estimated amounts will be appropriated in each year, and 
     that outlays will follow historical spending patterns.
       If an agency fails to comply with the bill's requirements, 
     the SBA would determine that the existing or proposed rule is 
     no longer in effect or would not apply to small entities. 
     Because CBO expects that federal agencies would generally 
     comply with the bill's requirements, we estimate that any 
     budgetary effects stemming from that change would be 
     insignificant.
       In addition, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would 
     increase administrative costs for most agencies because they 
     would need additional staff to carry out the bill's 
     provisions.

       Direct spending: The administrative costs of the Consumer 
     Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance 
     Corporation, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and 
     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), are 
     classified in the budget as direct spending. Two of those 
     agencies, the NCUA and the OCC, collect fees from financial 
     institutions to offset their costs; those fees are treated as 
     reductions in direct spending.
       Using information about the rulemaking activities of those 
     agencies, CBO estimates that the increased administrative 
     workload under H.R. 7198 would increase net direct spending 
     for those independent agencies by $10 million over the 2025-
     2034 period.
       Revenues: H.R. 7198 also would affect revenues by 
     increasing operating costs for the Federal Reserve System, 
     which remits its net earnings to the Treasury; those 
     remittances are classified as revenues in the federal budget. 
     Based on the costs of similar activities, CBO estimates that 
     the increased costs under the bill would reduce revenues by 
     $7 million over the 2025-2034 period.
       Spending subject to appropriation: CBO estimates that 
     implementing H.R. 7198 also would increase spending for 
     agencies that are funded by annual appropriations. CBO 
     estimates that agencies that produce large numbers of rules 
     affecting small entities would need more staff to meet the 
     bill's requirements.
       CBO expects that the agencies most affected by the bill 
     include the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and 
     Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, and Transportation, 
     and the Environmental Protection Agency and Securities and 
     Exchange Commission (SEC). Using information about similar 
     activities, CBO estimates that the administrative costs for 
     federal agencies to implement H.R. 7198 would total $35 
     million over the 2025-2029 period; any related spending would 
     be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
       Under current law, the SEC is authorized to collect fees 
     sufficient to offset its annual appropriations. Therefore, 
     CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of that 
     commission's activities to implement H.R. 7198 would be less 
     than $500,000 over the 2025-2029 period, assuming 
     appropriation actions consistent with the commission's 
     authorities.
       Finally, the requirement for the SBA to establish and carry 
     out a process for small entities to request certification 
     review would pose additional costs to that agency. Using 
     information from the SBA, CBO estimates that those 
     administrative costs would total $5 million over the 2025-
     2029 period; any related spending would be subject to the 
     availability of appropriated funds.
       Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go 
     Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement 
     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or 
     revenues. The net changes in outlays and revenues that are 
     subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 
     1.
       Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO 
     estimates that enacting H.R. 7198 would not increase net 
     direct spending by more than $2.5 billion in any of the four 
     consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2035.
       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 7198 would not increase 
     on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in any of the four 
     consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2035.
       Mandates: If federal financial regulators increase annual 
     fees to offset the costs of implementing the bill, H.R. 7198 
     would increase the costs of an existing private-sector 
     mandate on entities required to pay those fees. CBO estimates 
     that the incremental cost of the mandate would be small and 
     would fall well below the annual threshold established in the 
     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for private-sector 
     mandates ($200 million in 2024, adjusted annually for 
     inflation).
       The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined 
     in UMRA.
       Previous CBO estimate: On December x, 2024, CBO transmitted 
     a cost estimate for H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 2024, as 
     ordered reported by the House Committee on Small Business on 
     September 10, 2024. The two pieces of legislation are 
     similar, and CBO's estimates of their budgetary effects are 
     the same.
       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Julia Aman (for the 
     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit 
     Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of 
     the Currency), David Hughes (for the Consumer Financial 
     Protection Bureau), Aurora Swanson (for the Small Business 
     Administration and for federal agencies funded by annual 
     appropriations); Revenues: Nathaniel Frentz; Mandates: Rachel 
     Austin.

     Housing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen 
     FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit;

It Act, which gives small businesses a seat at the table during the 
regulatory process and shields them from the most heavyhanded, one-
size-fits-all regulations.
  Government red tape has made it harder and more costly for Americans 
to start a business. For many, this hinders their opportunity to 
achieve the American Dream. For too long, D.C. bureaucrats have abused 
their power, trampling over the small businesses, which are the 
backbone of our communities.
  Simply put, the Prove It Act gives teeth to the already-existing law, 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which is often ignored by Federal 
agencies in pursuit of their own political agenda.
  Under RFA, agencies are required to complete an initial and final 
analysis of their regulations and certify that they will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
Unfortunately, in many cases, agencies have failed to meet the 
standards set out by the RFA and, in turn, have left our small business 
owners with the short end of the stick.
  Throughout the last 4 years, the Biden-Harris administration has 
improperly certified dozens of regulations as not having a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small businesses.
  Moreover, according to the American Action Forum, since 2009, Federal 
regulations have cost American taxpayers and businessowners $2.3 
trillion to comply with them and have added 985 million hours of 
paperwork for our small businesses to shoulder. The Biden 
administration alone has accounted for $1.8 trillion of these costs and 
over 340 million paperwork hours.
  With these compliance costs and paperwork hours skyrocketing, the 
Prove It Act is more important now than ever. Specifically, the Prove 
It Act will require Federal agencies to analyze both the direct and 
indirect costs their regulations would have on our small entities, 
create a way for small businesses to petition their chief advocate in 
government to review agencies' work and to make them prove that they 
are fully compliant with already-existing laws. If agencies fail to 
comply with the review process, small businesses would be exempt from 
the regulations in question.
  Moreover, the bill ensures that small businesses can easily access 
preexisting guidance documents via regulations.gov. If agencies failed 
to perform an already-required 10-year retrospective review, the 
regulations would be nullified, giving teeth to this requirement that 
currently is in statute.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from the 
National Federation of Independent Business; Job Creators Network; 
National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association; National Association of 
Insurance and Financial Advisors; a coalition letter on Regulatory 
Flexibility Act reform signed by over 45 national associations; and a 
May 21, 2024, letter from numerous Chambers of Commerce.


                                                         NFIB,

                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2024.
     Hon. Brad Finstad,
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Finstad: On behalf of NFIB, the 
     nation's leading small business advocacy organization, I 
     write in support of the Prove It Act. This legislation would 
     strengthen the requirements for agencies to analyze the 
     impact of regulations on small businesses and increase small 
     business engagement in the regulatory process.
       NFIB members annually rate ``unreasonable government 
     regulation'' as one of the top concerns facing small 
     businesses. Unfortunately, the red tape and compliance 
     burdens of small businesses continue to grow exponentially. 
     According to a recent analysis, the total cost of federal 
     regulations in 2022 was $3.079 trillion. The study found that 
     the average U.S. company pays roughly $13,000 per employee to 
     comply with federal regulations.
       The pace of regulation has significantly increased over the 
     last three years. As of January 26, 2024, President Biden had 
     imposed more than $454 billion of final rule costs and 279 
     million paperwork hours. These regulatory costs are massive. 
     However, they pale in comparison to the proposed $616 billion 
     of regulatory costs and 191 million paperwork hours that are 
     under development by the administration.
       Small businesses often do not have compliance officers or 
     lawyers to help navigate these massive new regulatory 
     burdens. And existing laws like the Regulatory Flexibility 
     Act (RFA) were enacted to minimize the disproportionate 
     impact that federal regulations have on small businesses. 
     However, as NFIB's 2023 found, agencies use loopholes in the 
     RFA to underreport, minimize, or ignore the impact of 
     regulations on small businesses.
       This circumvention of the RFA is unacceptable and small 
     businesses ultimately pay the regulatory price in forgone 
     growth and opportunity. That is why legislation like the 
     Prove It Act is so important. The Prove It Act seeks to 
     address the loopholes in the RFA by increasing small business 
     input in the regulatory process and strengthening the 
     requirements for agencies to examine the impacts of 
     regulations on small businesses.
       NFIB supports the Prove It Act and urges Congress to 
     promptly enact this legislation. Small businesses appreciate 
     your continued leadership to reduce onerous regulatory 
     burdens and red tape.
           Sincerely,
                                                      Josh McLeod,
     Director, Federal Government Relations NFIB.

                                      Addison, TX, March 20, 2024.
     Hon. Jim Jordan,
     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,
     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nadler, and Members of 
     the Committee: In advance of the Judiciary Committee's markup 
     tomorrow, the Job Creators Network expresses its strong 
     support for the ``Prove it Act of 2024.'' JCN urges the 
     Committee to pass this bipartisan legislation that would 
     ensure federal agencies conduct meaningful reviews of the 
     burden proposed rules would have on small business and hold 
     them accountable if they do not.
       JCN is a nonpartisan organization founded by entrepreneurs 
     who believe that many government policies are getting in the 
     way of the economic freedom that helped make this country 
     prosperous.
       JCN provides business leaders and entrepreneurs with the 
     tools to become the voice of free enterprise in the media, in 
     Congress, in state capitals, in their communities, and their 
     workplaces--allowing them to hold politicians accountable to 
     job creators and their employees.
       The ``Prove it Act of 2024'' would help shield small 
     businesses from executive overreach and provide Main Street 
     with important tools to help contend with government 
     overregulation.
       According to the U.S. Small Business Administration's 
     Office of Advocacy small businesses employ almost half--46.4 
     percent--of America's employees. Truly America's job 
     creators, small businesses accounted for 62.7 percent of net 
     new jobs from 1995 to 2021.
       Despite their significant contributions to our nation's 
     economy, small business owners get the short end of the stick 
     when it comes to regulation--one size does not fit all.
       It is well-documented that small business owners are 
     disproportionately negatively impacted by regulation as 
     compared to big businesses.
       When it comes to regulation, it is important to remember 
     that seventy-nine percent of small businesses have fewer than 
     ten employees. Firms with fewer than ten employees do not 
     employ attorneys, accountants, or human resource 
     professionals. If they are lucky, they have someone to manage 
     sales. As a practical matter that means that it is the small 
     business owner who is tasked with those duties, many of which 
     involve regulatory compliance.
       Moreover, it is well-documented that small business owners 
     spend more on regulation than larger businesses. Businesses 
     with fewer than fifty employees pay $14,700 per employee, as 
     compared to $13,890 per employee for medium-sized businesses, 
     and $12,200 per employee for large businesses.
       Despite these realities, increasingly we see federal 
     regulators view their legal obligation to assess small 
     business impact of new regulations as nothing more than a 
     ``check the box'' exercise. According to an investigation 
     conducted by the House Committee on Small Business, many 
     government agencies in Washington are ``failing to properly 
     implement'' statutes intended to shield small businesses from 
     overburdensome regulations.
       For example, the Army Corps of Engineers has twice 
     certified as not significantly impacting small businesses its 
     proposal to redefine ``waters of the United States'' in a way 
     that would require millions of landowners to get a federal 
     permit before doing things as simple as moving mulch. 
     Similarly, the Department of Labor had the audacity to 
     certify its recent regulation that effectively converts most 
     independent contractors into employees as a mandate with 
     little impact on small business. These are just two of many 
     examples where federal bureaucrats are not following the 
     letter and spirit of the Regulatory Flexibility Act when it 
     comes to protecting small businesses from one-size-fits-all 
     regulation.
       The ``Prove it Act of 2024'' fulfills a key pillar of the 
     Job Creators Network's American Small Business Prosperity 
     Plan--an eight-point policy blueprint--by reducing the 
     regulatory burden on small businesses.
       The ``Prove it Act of 2024'' would bolster existing law 
     that federal agencies have been side-stepping at the expense 
     of small businesses. It would hold agencies accountable by 
     providing a meaningful opportunity for small businesses to 
     challenge an agency certification that a proposed regulation 
     would not impact a substantial number of small entities. And 
     small businesses would be exempt

[[Page H6384]]

     from any rule in which an agency fails to follow the law.
       Small business regulatory protections are in dire need of 
     restoration. Passage of the ``Prove it Act of 2024'' would be 
     a step in the right direction. We commend the Committee for 
     marking up this important legislation and urge its passage. 
     It is time for our elected leaders in Washington to 
     prioritize Main Street.

                                                        NSSGA,

                                Alexandria, VA, February 29, 2024.
     Hon. Brian Finstad,
     U.S. Congressman,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Yadira Caraveo,
     U.S. Congresswoman,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Nathaniel Moran,
     U.S. Congressman,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Congressman Finstad, Congresswoman Caraveo, and 
     Congressman Moran: I am writing on behalf of the over 400 
     members of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association 
     (NSSGA), to express our strong support for the bipartisan 
     Prove It Act that you recently introduced. The aggregates 
     industry, like many others, has faced considerable challenges 
     due to the increasing complexity and scope of federal 
     regulations. These regulations often impose substantial 
     direct and indirect costs on small businesses, which unlike 
     larger entities, lack the resources to navigate these 
     regulatory burdens effectively.
       NSSGA represents the aggregates industry, including 
     thousands of quarries, sand and gravel operations, and other 
     related businesses nationwide. NSSGA members conduct over 
     9,000 operations and employ over 100,000 citizens to create 
     2.5 billion tons of aggregates each year. These raw materials 
     are essential to rebuild and repair our country's aging 
     infrastructure and assist our nation's goals in lowering the 
     overall energy cost for families.
       The Prove It Act represents a significant step forward in 
     ensuring that small businesses, including those within the 
     aggregates sector, are not unduly burdened by regulations 
     that can stifle innovation, reduce job creation, and hamper 
     economic growth. By requiring federal agencies to analyze the 
     impact of their regulations on small entities and limit these 
     impacts, the legislation aligns with our longstanding 
     commitment to sensible, balanced regulatory frameworks that 
     protect the environment and public safety without imposing 
     unnecessary costs on businesses.
       Moreover, the Act's provisions for creating mechanisms for 
     small businesses to raise concerns and request reviews are 
     especially important. These measures provide a vital avenue 
     for our members to ensure that regulations are fair, 
     transparent, and consider the unique challenges faced by 
     small businesses. Ensuring easy access to guidance documents 
     and direct communication channels with regulators will also 
     greatly benefit small businesses by reducing compliance 
     uncertainty and fostering a more cooperative regulatory 
     environment.
       We thank you for your leadership and commitment to 
     protecting small businesses from overbearing regulations. The 
     Prove It Act will help ensure that federal agencies fully 
     consider the impact of their actions on small entities, 
     promoting a healthier business environment and supporting the 
     vital contributions of small businesses to our national 
     economy.
       We look forward to the passage of this important 
     legislation and stand ready to support its implementation to 
     ensure that it delivers meaningful benefits to the aggregates

                                                        NAIFA,

                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2024.
     Hon. Brad Finstad,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Finstad: On behalf of the National 
     Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (``NAIFA''), 
     I write in support of the Prove It Act. This legislation 
     would strengthen the requirements for agencies to analyze the 
     impact of regulations on insurance producers, registered 
     representatives of broker-dealers, and financial advisors.
       Founded in 1890 as The National Association of Life 
     Underwriters, NAIFA is the oldest, largest, and most 
     prestigious association representing the interests of 
     financial professionals from every Congressional district in 
     the United States. Our mission--empowering financial 
     professionals and consumers with world-class advocacy and 
     education--is the reason NAIFA has consistently and 
     resoundingly stood up for agents and called upon members to 
     grow their knowledge while following the highest ethical 
     standards in the industry.
       NAIFA members are Main Street financial professionals. 
     NAIFA members--comprised primarily of insurance agents, many 
     of whom are also registered Broker-Dealer representatives--
     serve primarily middle-market clients, including individuals 
     and small businesses. Nine out of ten NAIFA members report 
     serving middle-income individuals and families and 67 percent 
     work with small businesses. A typical client's annual 
     household income falls below $150,000 for 69 percent of NAIFA 
     members. In some cases, our members are the only financial 
     advisor across multiple counties.
       NAIFA members are also small business owners. Many of our 
     members work in small firms--sometimes firms of one--with 
     little administrative or back-office support. Often, their 
     business practices are dictated by the broker-dealer with 
     whom they work, including the format and provision of client 
     forms and disclosures. They are also subject to transaction-
     level oversight and review by the broker-dealer.
       The Prove It Act would require federal agencies to consider 
     reasonably foreseeable indirect future costs of their 
     proposed federal regulations as part of their Initial 
     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, where feasible. The proposed 
     legislation also creates a process whereby small businesses 
     and organizations representing small business can ask the 
     Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy to 
     formally review a federal agency's certification that a 
     proposed regulatory rule will not have a significant economic 
     impact on a substantial number of small entities under the 
     Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). This ensures small 
     businesses will be able to raise concerns that a rule was 
     improperly certified and have a third-party review and 
     determine whether certification was proper.
       The Prove It Act would also require that, for any guidance 
     document or other relevant documents clarifying or 
     interpreting any rule found by agencies to likely have a 
     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
     entities, agencies shall publish said documents, as 
     determined by the agency, to Regulations.gov or similar 
     website and allow for comments to ensure small businesses can 
     both easily access the resources and provide feedback or 
     request additional clarity where needed.
       The regulatory burden on insurance producers, registered 
     representatives of broker-dealers, and financial advisors is 
     often put in place without proper discussion or concern for 
     the negative impact on the ability to conduct business or 
     properly serve clients and consumers. Additionally, federal 
     regulators often work to circumnavigate the RFA, which leads 
     to a loss of growth and opportunity for these small 
     businesses that represent Main Street America and make up an 
     integral part of the community in which they work. That is 
     why legislation like the Prove It Act is so important. The 
     Prove It Act seeks to address the loopholes in the RFA by 
     increasing small business input in the regulatory process and 
     strengthening the requirements for agencies to examine the 
     impacts of regulations on small businesses.
       NAIFA offers its full support to the Prove It Act and urges 
     Congress to promptly enact this legislation. Insurance 
     Producers, the registered representatives of broker-dealers, 
     and financial advisors appreciate your continued leadership 
     to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and to allow these 
     vital insurance professionals to continue to serve the best 
     interest of their clients.
           Sincerely,
     Michael W. Hedge, Jr.
       Senior Director, Government Relations, National Association 
     of Insurance and Financial Advisors.
                                                September 5, 2024.
     Hon. Roger Williams,
     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Nydia Velazquez,
     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez:  On 
     behalf of millions of small businesses across the country, we 
     write to thank you for prioritizing legislation to provide 
     regulatory relief and reduce red tape for small businesses. 
     We urge the Committee to advance legislation to strengthen 
     the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and ensure the intent of 
     the law is fulfilled.
       Small businesses are concerned with the unprecedented pace 
     of regulations coming from Washington. Over the last three 
     and a half years, more than $1.6 trillion in new regulatory 
     costs and almost 300 million new paperwork hours have been 
     imposed on the private sector. These new burdens fall 
     disproportionately on small businesses that do not have 
     lawyers and compliance officers to navigate complex 
     regulatory issues.
       In 1980, President Carter and Congress recognized the 
     disproportionate impact of federal regulations on small 
     businesses and unanimously approved the Regulatory 
     Flexibility Act (RFA). The RFA sought to minimize the burdens 
     on small businesses. However, in the 40-plus years since the 
     RFA became law, agencies have found ways to disregard or 
     avoid many of the requirements. In 2023, NFIB analyzed the 
     Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy's 
     comment letters to federal agencies from January 2021 to 
     January 2023 and found significant noncompliance with the 
     RFA. Advocacy highlighted 28 instances where agencies failed 
     to adequately examine the economic costs of regulations. 
     Advocacy noted that agencies often improperly certify that 
     rules will not have a significant economic impact on a 
     substantial number of small entities. By doing so, agencies 
     disregard the intent of the RFA, leaving small businesses 
     subject to the one-size-fits-all regulatory environment the 
     RFA sought to remedy.

[[Page H6385]]

       The House Committee on Small Business recently issued a 
     staff report examining agency compliance with the RFA. The 
     Committee found that most agencies are failing to properly 
     comply with the RFAs requirements and live up to the spirit 
     of the law. These findings mirror the conclusions of NFIB's 
     2023 White Paper and highlight the need to close loopholes to 
     ensure the intent of the RFA is fulfilled.
       In response to these findings, the Committee has 
     prioritized several legislative proposals to strengthen the 
     RFA. One proposal, the bipartisan Prove It Act, would 
     increase small business input in the regulatory process and 
     ensure agencies are fully accounting for the impact of 
     regulations on small businesses. Other proposals would 
     increase the transparency and accountability of the 
     regulatory process for small businesses.
       On behalf of millions of small businesses, thank you for 
     your attention to the disproportionate impact of regulations 
     on small entities. We appreciate the Committee's focus on 
     ensuring the intent of the RFA is fulfilled through 
     legislation like H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act. We urge 
     Congress to take swift action to reduce red tape for small 
     businesses.

                                                     May 21, 2024.
       To the Members of the United States House of 
     Representatives: The undersigned chambers of commerce 
     strongly support H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 2024, and 
     urge the House to consider this important legislation.
       This bipartisan bill was introduced by Representatives Brad 
     Finstad, Nathaniel Moran, and Yadira Caraveo and is co-
     sponsored by Representatives Mike Gallagher, Harriett 
     Hageman, Maria Salazar, David Valadao, and Carol Miller. H.R. 
     7198 was reported by the Judiciary Committee in March and 
     would be a major step forward for small businesses that are 
     harmed by excessive federal regulations.
       American small business owners are job creators and 
     innovators. While their contributions to their communities 
     and to the American economy are enormous, they bear an 
     unreasonably heavy burden when it comes to regulatory costs. 
     The annual cost of complying with federal regulations has 
     risen by $465 billion since 2012 and now totals over $3 
     trillion (12 percent of U.S. GDP). The per employee cost of 
     $12,800 for small businesses is 20 percent greater than the 
     cost per employee at their larger competitors.
       The Regulatory Flexibility Act--passed 44-years ago--was 
     intended to correct the lopsided burden on small business and 
     require that regulators tailor rules to meet government 
     objectives while minimizing the burden on small businesses. 
     Unfortunately, federal agencies too often exploit loopholes 
     in the law to hide costs imposed on Main Street businesses 
     and to ignore their feedback.
       The Prove it Act of 2024 would close those loopholes and 
     bring more transparency to the true costs of red tape on 
     America's innovators, job creators, and community builders. 
     The bill would also prevent agencies from ignoring small 
     business input in their rush to finalize new federal 
     regulations.
       We urge expeditious House consideration of H.R. 7198, the 
     Prove it Act.

  Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, the Prove It Act gives the hardworking 
American small businesses a voice in the regulatory process. It is time 
that we strengthen and empower our small business community rather than 
force them to comply with unnecessary and burdensome regulations.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Caraveo and Representative Moran 
for partnering with me on this important legislation, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to vote in support of the Prove It Act.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. Lee Carter), the newest Member of the Judiciary Committee, 
proudly carrying on her mother's legacy.
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act of 
2024, a bill that would vest the chief counsel of the Office of 
Advocacy within the Small Business Administration, which has been 
chronically underfunded--and I wish we were spending time on that 
instead of this bill--with enormous and unreviewable authority over 
agency rules.
  More specifically, H.R. 7198 authorizes the chief counsel, 
unilaterally and without review, to exempt large parts of the business 
community from proposed rules if he or she determines that an agency 
did not properly consider how a proposed rule could affect small 
entities.
  In doing so, this bill would empower large companies and undermine 
the regulatory process that keeps Americans safe by imposing a series 
of requirements on regulatory agencies.
  As we all know, regulatory agencies play a critical role in our 
safety and well-being by writing rules designed to protect our food 
supply, environment, physical infrastructure, and more. These 
regulations safeguard the freedoms that all Americans enjoy.
  While efforts to ease burdens on small businesses can be useful, they 
should not prevent regulators from doing their jobs in the public 
interests.
  The Prove It Act, under the guise of helping all small businesses, 
would actually allow an unelected administrator within the SBA to 
circumvent congressional and agency intent with little oversight. It is 
simply unacceptable that we would task a single official in the SBA 
with unilateral and unreviewable authority to suspend new and existing 
protections and safeguards for large swaths of the economy, not to 
mention that it would also require agencies to jump through new, 
vaguely defined and nontransparent bureaucratic hoops, which would 
cause delays and uncertainty, all the while doing nothing to actually 
help small businesses.
  In fact, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, consisting of over 
200 labor, consumer, and environmental organizations, oppose this bill, 
including the AFL-CIO, Economic Policy Institute, and National Women's 
Law Center.
  It is important to convey to the American people that this bill is 
also simply unnecessary. By law, agencies already take small businesses 
into account, and these small entities already

[[Page H6387]]

have power through the Office of Advocacy to champion their concerns.
  Rules and protections are critical to ensuring the safety and 
soundness of virtually every facet of our lives, including clean air, 
clean water, safe toys that my children might use, safe cars while I 
drive my children to school, and safe workplaces for all of us.
  Mr. Speaker, we should reject any efforts that would prevent agencies 
from issuing these lifesaving regulations. Therefore, I urge my 
colleagues to vote against H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Moran).
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 7198, the Prove 
It Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to protect small businesses 
from the burdens of Federal regulations.
  I was proud to join Congressman Finstad and Congresswoman Caraveo in 
introducing this bill and to vote for it in the House Judiciary 
Committee.
  This legislation puts teeth into the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 
which has been discussed today. In 1980, it required Federal agencies 
to take into consideration the direct and indirect impacts of their 
regulations on small and family businesses, but it is not being 
enforced today.

                              {time}  1245

  Effectively, there is no recourse to those businesses under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, which is why, in more than 75 percent of 
the cases, these new regulations actually completely ignore that 
Regulatory Flexibility Act or put a de minimis amount attached to the 
impact on small businesses.
  We need teeth to that 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Prove 
It Act will do just that. It will change what has not been done in the 
past, and it will restore power to small businesses today to push back 
against new regulations.
  Today, small businesses pay seven times more per employee than 
medium-sized businesses to stay compliant with Federal regulations. 
They don't have the resources to keep pace with the ever-growing 
burdens imposed by the heavy hand of the government.
  I am amazed that I am hearing from the opposition words like 
``delay,'' ``burden,'' and ``uncertainty'' as it relates to the Federal 
Government. I am more concerned with the delays, burden, uncertainty, 
and inadequate resources that exist for small businesses to respond to 
these new regulations.
  Federal agencies seem to ignore the reality and harm that these 
regulations cause, which only further discourages American innovation 
and small business growth.
  The Prove It Act empowers small businesses to petition the Small 
Business Administration to review proposed Federal regulations and 
gives them the tools to challenge unnecessary regulation imposed upon 
them, which they do not have today. It brings more accountability and 
transparency to the work of government agencies and reaffirms our 
commitment to stand with small business.
  If we are going to stand on the side of government or small business, 
I choose to stand on the side of small business. Small businesses are, 
in fact, the backbone of our economy, and their innovation keeps the 
spirit of the American Dream alive.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation 
to support the crucial role small businesses play as drivers of 
economic growth and job creation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7198, the Prove It Act.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. Caraveo).
  Ms. CARAVEO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Nadler for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act. 
I also thank my colleagues, Congressman Finstad and Congressman Moran, 
for working with me to run this bipartisan legislation.
  Colorado has more than 600,000 small businesses owned by men and 
women who work hard day in and day out to provide for their families 
and serve our communities. Small business owners already face 
innumerable hurdles in pursuit of the American Dream, and burdensome 
regulations only add to their challenges.
  The repercussions of overregulation are long lasting, impacting our 
economy and communities from the moment they are implemented, 
particularly in the Front Range and northern Colorado.
  Unfortunately, the requirement for analyzing both the direct and 
indirect costs imposed on small businesses has often not been satisfied 
by various Federal agencies. That is where our bill comes in.
  This bill would allow small business owners to be heard when they 
feel the Federal Government is imposing expensive roadblocks on them. 
It will shield small businesses from undue regulatory burdens and 
improve communication between small entities and Federal agencies.
  Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a point to engage with 
local small businesses directly through a series of roundtables 
throughout the Front Range and northern Colorado. These discussions 
highlighted the most pressing issues facing these small businesses, 
particularly the disproportionate impact excessive regulations have on 
their operations.
  With the already razor-thin margins under which these small 
businesses operate, they need more of our help to thrive. As their 
Representative, I believe it is my duty to give a voice in Congress to 
our small businesses and ensure that they have a seat at the table in 
the regulatory process. Their views and priorities must be taken into 
consideration if we hope to foster a dynamic and robust economy.
  Passing the Prove It Act means we can continue to support the small 
businesses that are driving our economy.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Representatives Finstad and Moran for 
their work on this bipartisan legislation and for their diligent 
efforts to support our small businesses, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this effort.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams).
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
7198, the Prove It Act of 2024, introduced by Representative Finstad. 
In full disclosure, I am a small business owner.
  The Prove It Act is an important piece of legislation that will give 
small business owners the ability to petition the government when an 
agency fails to actively account for regulations impacting their 
operations.
  Over the past 4 years, the Biden administration has created an 
unbelievable amount of $1.7 trillion in new regulations. The Committee 
on Small Business, which I chair, conducted a thorough investigation 
into how it was possible to achieve this unfortunate milestone. We 
discovered that many agencies are treating the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, a law that is supposed to protect small businesses from the most 
costly regulations, like a check-the-box exercise. They do not uphold 
the spirit of the law, which is an important check on the 
administrative state.
  The Prove It Act would close many of the loopholes being utilized by 
Federal agencies and give small businesses the ability for their choice 
and their voice to be heard when the system fails them.

  Main Street America has been dealing with many different economic 
headwinds. Inflation and labor shortages alone have made it a challenge 
for small business to survive. Out-of-control regulations are just one 
more obstacle that businessowners must work to overcome.
  My committee held over 13 hearings where we brought in real small 
business owners to discuss the impact regulations had on their 
operations. Every one of our witnesses said that taking time to 
understand and comply with the new mandates prevents them from focusing 
on their core operations: giving service and selling product.
  These small businesses are the economic engines of the country, and 
we must do all we can to support their continued success. The Prove It 
Act takes important steps in ensuring that agencies comply with the 
intent of the RFA and fully consider small businesses in the rulemaking 
process.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7198.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, over 200 labor, consumer protection, and 
environmental organizations oppose H.R. 7198, the Prove It Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of opposition from the 
Coalition

for Sensible Safeguards, Earthjustice, and Public Citizen.
                                                     Coalition for


                                          Sensible Safeguards,

                                                 December 4, 2024.
     Representative Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Representative Hakeem Jeffries,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson and Democratic Leader Jeffries: The 
     Coalition for Sensible Safeguards (CSS), an alliance of over 
     200 labor, scientific, research, good government, faith, 
     community, health, environmental, and public interest groups, 
     is writing regarding the House of Representatives' 
     consideration of the Prove It Act of 2024, H.R. 7198 which 
     CSS strongly opposes.
       The Prove It Act would expand the authority of the Small 
     Business Administration's Office of Advocacy while failing to 
     address fundamental flaws of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
     This bill would slow down the regulatory process and empower 
     an office that has been neither appropriately focused on 
     small business concerns nor adequately transparent in how it 
     conducts its actions.
       The ostensible purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act is 
     to ensure that small businesses continue to play a role in 
     the U.S. economy. In practice, though, the implementation of 
     the Regulatory Flexibility Act has failed to achieve this 
     basic purpose, as it has instead been wielded as a blunt 
     weapon to weaken regulatory requirements for firms of all 
     sizes, often at the behest of large corporations and the 
     trade associations they dominate.
       The result is that protections of public health, safety, 
     and the environment have been sacrificed without 
     substantially improving the competitive position of small 
     businesses in their respective industrial sectors relative to 
     that of larger firms. These flaws are most apparent in the 
     Regulatory Flexibility Act's burdensome analytical 
     requirements, which are designed to weaken regulatory 
     safeguards rather than promote small business 
     competitiveness. H.R. 7198 does not fix this basic problem, 
     however. Instead, it would expand those analytical 
     requirements and make them more onerous.
       The Prove It Act would enhance the authority of the Small 
     Business Administration's Office of Advocacy in harmful ways. 
     H.R. 7198, in Section 2(a)(3), would allow for endless 
     petitions from ``Any small entity, group of small entities, 
     or organization representing the interests of small 
     entities'' that challenge a rulemaking agency's certification 
     that its rule would not have a significant economic impact on 
     a substantial number of small entities. In many cases, these 
     petitions would trigger burdensome hearings conducted by the 
     Chief Counsel for the Office of Advocacy, after which the 
     Chief Counsel could then force the rulemaking agency to 
     retract the certification and instead perform the full suite 
     of burdensome analyses mandated by the Regulatory Flexibility 
     Act. The bill also provides for expanded judicial review 
     opportunities against agency certifications, which would 
     further tie up rulemakings in wasteful and time-consuming 
     litigation.
       We urge members of the House of Representatives to consider 
     reforms that would instead place greater constraints on the 
     Office of Advocacy to ensure that it is actually helping, 
     rather than harming, small businesses. A scathing 2014 report 
     by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found 
     significant deficiencies in the Small Business 
     Administration's Office of Advocacy's compliance with its own 
     internal procedures when it intervenes in regulatory actions 
     or engages in commissioning research on regulatory costs to 
     small businesses. Of greatest relevance, GAO found that: (1) 
     the Office had no policies dictating when individual staff 
     should intervene in individual rulemakings, making it 
     susceptible to improper industry influence; and (2) the 
     Office repeatedly cited small business input in its 
     regulatory comments but could provide no evidence or 
     documentation supporting this input.
       Evidence has also demonstrated the extent to which the 
     Office of Advocacy has been captured by regulated industry. 
     The Office has often worked with large trade associations to 
     weaken rules in ways that benefit large businesses, at the 
     expense of small ones. These interventions have the effect of 
     harming small businesses, contrary to the Office's statutory 
     mission. Nevertheless, this bill would give the Small 
     Business Administration's Office of Advocacy even greater 
     authority to intervene in and block agency rules.
       Additionally, the Prove It Act would further delay needed 
     regulatory actions--causing real harm to public health and 
     safety and the environment--without improving the quality of 
     agency decision-making. Numerous studies have demonstrated 
     how existing regulatory analyses, and procedural requirements 
     contribute to extensive delays of agency rulemaking. These 
     studies confirm that existing Regulatory Flexibility Act 
     requirements are among the biggest contributors to these 
     delays. By creating new analytical and procedural 
     requirements, this bill would only worsen those delays. These 
     additional delays are unjustifiable because they do not 
     result in better regulatory decisions.
       Finally, the bill would empower the federal judiciary to 
     block regulations by making agency compliance with its new 
     analytical and procedural requirements judicially reviewable. 
     This would provide judges with an additional new tool for 
     blocking needed public protections.
       Providing the Small Business Administration's Office of 
     Advocacy with more authority to block, delay, or weaken new 
     regulatory safeguards, without enacting the significant 
     reforms recommended by GAO and others, will leave the public 
     even more at risk to health, safety, and economic security 
     threats. The numerous petitions, time-consuming hearings, and 
     expanded judicial review that this legislation would allow 
     will thwart needed protections while failing to help small 
     businesses with better designed regulations.
       CSS urges the House of Representatives to oppose the Prove 
     It Act and encourages the Committee to evaluate proposals 
     that offer real and meaningful reforms to strengthen the 
     regulatory process, such as H.R. 1507, the Stop Corporate 
     Capture Act.
       We hope to work with the House of Representatives to ensure 
     that our regulatory process is working effectively and 
     efficiently to protect the American public.
       We strongly urge opposition to the Prove It Act of 2024, 
     H.R. 7198.
           Sincerely,

                                             Rachel Weintraub,

                                     Executive Director, Coalition
     for Sensible Safeguards.

                                                 Earthjustice,

                                Washington, DC, November 26, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries: On behalf of 
     Earthjustice, I strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 7198, the 
     Prove It Act, which would further a dangerous deregulatory 
     agenda to restrict federal agencies from protecting our 
     environment, health, safety, workforce, and civil rights.
       The Prove It Act is an unnecessary deregulatory legislative 
     proposal that seeks to address a problem already addressed by 
     existing Federal law. Proponents of the bill believe small 
     businesses are not allowed enough opportunities to engage 
     directly with agencies to impact the policies, ultimately 
     limiting and hindering their ability to conduct business, 
     create jobs, and compete with larger corporations. The 
     narrative that the rulemaking process leaves small businesses 
     little to no opportunity to address potential economic 
     impacts and engage directly is inaccurate and perpetuates 
     dangerous deregulatory propaganda.
       Despite being debilitating underfunding, Agencies are 
     charged with complying with overarching federal requirements 
     that consider impacts on all industries, including small 
     businesses. Agencies, when proposing new rules, are legally 
     bound by the constraints of the authorizing statute passed by 
     Congress, the Administrative Procedure Act, providing 
     appropriate notice and comment opportunities to the public, 
     listening to the public and regulated entities (including 
     small businesses), and carefully reviewing all submitted 
     comments. Small businesses are provided multiple avenues to 
     engage in the rulemaking process and compliance resources 
     through state and federal government offices, including the 
     US Small Business Administration. Businesses can use the 
     Office of Advocacy and the Office of the National Ombudsman 
     within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to 
     address compliance concerns, make regulatory reform 
     recommendations, and handle enforcement issues.
       H.R. 7198 is a tool to help polluting corporations limit 
     their compliance responsibilities and unfairly shift the cost 
     of business to the public. Like other past attempts, this 
     bill seeks to expand the scope of authority of the Regulatory 
     Flexibility Act, which would increase unnecessary and lengthy 
     regulatory delays and encourage costly litigation. The 
     Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) already requires agencies to 
     consider alternatives to proposed regulations to limit 
     economic burdens to small entities while still achieving the 
     desired regulatory goals. Agencies must conduct initial 
     regulatory flexibility analysis, assessing potential impacts 
     on small entities and consider the feedback provided by small 
     entities during the rulemaking process. This bill would cost 
     additional resources and time by allowing small entities to 
     require duplicative regulatory analysis to rules they would 
     rather not comply with.
       Most concerning are the provisions of H.R. 7198, which 
     allow any small entity or organization representing a small 
     entity to petition the Chief Counsel of Advocacy for the 
     Small Business Administration to direct any agency to adopt a 
     new determination of the economic impact on small businesses. 
     If the agency does not do so or ``in any other way fails to 
     assist the Chief Counsel,'' the rule will be ineffective and 
     invalidated for all small entities.
       Regulations are vital to the public and small businesses, 
     yielding many benefits that outweigh the costs. H.R. 7198 act 
     seeks to delay these public protections at the detriment of 
     the environment and the public, yielding health and 
     environmental benefits for all who live here. While 
     regulations are associated with compliance costs and 
     administrative burdens, they can also provide significant 
     benefits to small businesses, including but not limited to 
     bolstering consumer confidence in their products and 
     services,

[[Page H6389]]

     leveraging the playing field by setting standards all must 
     meet, including larger competitors and preventing monopolies 
     or unsafe work environments, access to certain kinds of 
     federal contacts, and limiting legal liabilities related to 
     workplace safety or product safety issues.
       For all the reasons stated above, H.R. 7198 should be 
     opposed.
       Thank you for your consideration.

                                             Brielle L. Green,

                                                Public Citizen

                                 Washington, DC; December 4, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson and Democratic Leader Jeffries: On 
     Thursday, December 5, the House of Representatives will be 
     considering the Prove it Act of 2024, H.R. 7198. While Public 
     Citizen opposes H.R. 7198, this letter does not focus on 
     Public Citizen's concerns regarding that bill which are 
     outlined in a separate letter submitted to the members of the 
     House from the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards which Public 
     Citizen co-chairs. Instead, this letter is intended to 
     provide information that we believe will help assess the 
     current Administration's compliance with the Regulatory 
     Flexibility Act (RFA) as compared to prior Administrations. 
     As the government data we cite below shows, the current 
     Administration has complied with the RFA to a far greater 
     degree than the previous Administration. Thus, any claims 
     that the current Administration is not complying with the RFA 
     are not supported, and in fact contradicted, by the 
     government data we are sharing with members of the House.
       One of the most telling indications whether an 
     Administration is in compliance with the RFA comes from the 
     number of so-called ``SBREFA'' panels that an Administration 
     has conducted as compared to previous Administrations. Under 
     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
     (SBREFA), three agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency 
     (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
     (OSHA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 
     are required to conduct small business review panels prior to 
     proposing regulations that will have a ``significant impact 
     on a substantial number of small entities.'' The Small 
     Business Administration's Office of Advocacy (SBA Advocacy) 
     plays a central role in identifying small businesses to serve 
     on the panel and collect their feedback. SBREFA amended the 
     RFA to require these panels in order to provide small 
     businesses an opportunity to express concerns to these three 
     agencies when one of their regulations significantly impacts 
     small businesses. To be clear, these three agencies have put 
     in place regulations that have been among the most beneficial 
     in protecting the public.
       Our analysis of the number of SBREFA panels that occurred 
     from the Obama Administration through the current 
     Administration reveals a clear pattern of robust compliance 
     with the RFA under the Obama and Biden Administrations with 
     the opposite being the case under the Trump Administration. 
     According to data from SBA Advocacy's website, there were a 
     total of 31 SBREFA panels completed under the Obama 
     Administration. By contrast, there were a total of only 3 
     SBREFA panels completed under the entire Trump 
     Administration. Under the current Administration, there have 
     already been 22 SBREFA panels completed. Thus, the three 
     agencies subject to SBREFA completed a total of 53 panels 
     during the Obama and Biden Administrations, but only 3 panels 
     during the Trump Administration.
       Such a significant disparity in the number of SBREFA panels 
     under the current and previous two Administrations should be 
     concerning to the Committee as it gives the strong appearance 
     that the SBREFA panel process is hardly neutral but rather is 
     one-sided in practice by only seeking feedback from small 
     businesses when the three agencies subject to SBREFA 
     promulgate new regulatory protections but not when those 
     regulatory protections are rolled back. The Committee should 
     ensure that when small businesses face a less stable 
     regulatory environment and more regulatory uncertainty due to 
     regulatory rollbacks, the SBREFA panel process is reflecting 
     those concerns as intended.
       Additionally, Public Citizen urges Congress to conduct 
     robust oversight of SBA Advocacy due to longstanding concerns 
     that Advocacy has ignored certain small business viewpoints, 
     namely those that support federal regulations, while favoring 
     other small business viewpoints, namely those that oppose 
     federal regulations, in an unbalanced and asymmetric fashion. 
     While claiming to be ``independent,'' there is considerable 
     evidence that Advocacy is in reality acting in a partisan and 
     ideological manner by consistently scrutinizing and 
     expressing concerns about new federal regulations that 
     protect the public while doing the opposite when those 
     regulations are rolled back. Certainly, the data regarding 
     the number of SBREFA panels across recent Administrations 
     strongly supports the need for oversight from the Committee.
       We hope members of the House of Representatives will find 
     this information helpful as it assesses claims regarding the 
     current Administration's compliance with the RFA and 
     considers H.R. 7198 predicated on the false belief that the 
     current Administration is failing to comply with the RFA. 
     Public Citizen stands ready to assist Congress in any 
     potential oversight of agency compliance with the RFA and 
     whether SBA Advocacy is properly carrying out its 
     responsibilities under the RFA in a neutral and unbiased 
     fashion.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Lisa Gilbert,
                                     Co-President, Public Citizen.

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Landsman).
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the bill, not 
because I don't want to see a whole host of reforms as it relates to 
helping our small businesses but because it does not exclude the big 
corporations from exploiting this bill to seize more and more of our 
power and wealth. I think people are very frustrated with just how much 
wealth and power has been consolidated among a sliver of Americans and 
a few big corporations.
  For that reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to 
recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I 
would have offered this motion as an amendment to focus the same kind 
of thinking on our veterans.
  As part of the VA Committee and working with our veterans and our VA 
back home, I have become increasingly frustrated with the layers of 
bureaucracy that slow down care for our veterans or prevent care for 
our veterans. My amendment would provide an exemption to this bill for 
rules that are determined to have substantial beneficial effects on 
veterans and veteran programs.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this 
amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Ohio?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in 
voting for the motion to recommit.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 7198. I 
will start by thanking my good friend and colleague from Minnesota, 
Representative Brad Finstad, for his leadership with this legislation.
  Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They are the 
innovators, job creators, and backbone of our communities.
  In my home State of Minnesota, small businesses account for over 99 
percent of all businesses and employ more than half of all of our 
workforce. When small businesses succeed, America succeeds.
  Unfortunately, we have seen time and time again how the Biden-Harris 
administration has failed to prioritize these small businesses. 
Instead, it has burdened them with an avalanche of costly and 
unnecessary regulations, leaving businessowners to navigate a maze of 
red tape with little regard for their challenges.
  These regulations have a real and negative impact on entrepreneurs, 
making it harder for them to succeed and grow. It is clear: Small 
businesses need a stronger voice in the regulatory process.
  We have the tools to stop overregulation, but those tools need to be 
accessible, especially for the smallest of businesses. We must provide 
clear and accessible pathways for small businesses to hold Federal 
agencies accountable for the regulations they impose.
  That is why I am proud to cosponsor my fellow Minnesotan's bill. This 
bill gives small businesses the ability to challenge agency regulations 
and forces agencies to be transparent about how their regulations will 
affect small business owners.
  By holding agencies accountable and requiring transparency, we ensure 
that small businesses aren't left behind when new regulations are 
created. This is a critical step in ensuring that any regulation 
created in Washington is shaped with a clear understanding of the real-
world impact. By supporting this legislation, we can help small 
businesses thrive and continue to drive our economic growth.

[[Page H6390]]

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7198. Let's 
ensure small businesses are heard and their concerns are addressed.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. Velazquez), the distinguished ranking member of the 
Committee on Small Business.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7198, the 
Prove It Act.
  Part of the role of the Small Business Committee is to recognize the 
impact regulations have on small businesses and work to find ways to 
balance the shared goal of minimizing the burdens and achieving the 
intended effects of regulations.
  Throughout our committee hearings, we have heard that agencies have 
been better about considering the impact of their rules on small 
entities since the passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
  Another tool at our disposal is the ability of advocacy to convene 
SBREFA panels to give small businesses an opportunity to provide input 
at the beginning of the rulemaking process and when it is most 
important.
  The Office of Advocacy has been working diligently to educate and 
train rule-writing staff about their responsibilities, and we have seen 
the fruits of their labor. The analysis agencies are conducting has 
improved significantly.
  Yet, this bill ignores the current process. Instead of strengthening 
it to serve the interests of small employers, the bill we are 
considering today would bring our rulemaking process to a grinding 
halt.
  It will also give big corporations a powerful new tool to delay and 
weaken rules, causing uncertainty and harm to small employers.
  By creating an unworkable quasi-judicial process within the SBA's 
Office of Advocacy for reviewing agency certifications, it allows any 
group that claims to represent small businesses to petition Advocacy to 
block rules that it doesn't like.
  The Prove It Act also requires agencies to conduct retrospective 
reviews based on the indirect costs identified in the initial analysis, 
without recognizing that agencies may have modified the rule during the 
rulemaking process.
  Most concerning is the broad and unchecked authority of the chief 
counsel to announce that a rule is no longer effective if an agency 
fails to conduct a retrospective review. This means a small employer 
that came into compliance with an existing rule could see it eliminated 
and then possibly reinstated sometime in the future. This is 
counterproductive to what my colleagues state they are trying to 
achieve.

                              {time}  1300

  Finally, today's bill implements another lengthy process without 
providing additional assistance to an under-resourced Office of 
Advocacy. If enacted, Advocacy will need to double its staff and, no 
surprise, this bill provides no additional resources.
  CBO estimates that agencies and Advocacy will need an additional $40 
million over the next 5 years to implement this act, and that doesn't 
include the $17 million added to the Federal deficit.
  Small employers need certainty, and this bill fails to provide it. It 
would only serve to cause undue chaos and confusion while achieving 
very little to help and support our Nation's small employers. That is 
why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Ellzey).
  Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, small businesses have been hit hard in the 
last 4 years by rising costs, supply chain problems, and heavy 
regulations. These businesses, which make up a large part of America's 
economy, often bear the brunt of new Federal rules and regulations 
implemented by the Biden administration.
  The Prove It Act, H.R. 7198, is designed to help small businesses 
push back when Federal agencies don't follow the rules laid out in the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, or the RFA.
  This bill gives small businesses the power to challenge proposed 
regulations if an agency hasn't fully or accurately considered how 
those rules would affect them. It also requires agencies to consider 
indirect costs when conducting a regulatory flexibility analysis, 
publish any follow-up guidance to the rule online, and periodically 
review the rule to ensure it still makes sense. If the agency does not 
adhere to these requirements, small entities are exempt from complying 
with the rule. It is about time.
  While agencies are already required by the RFA to do this type of 
analysis, they are not required to make it public. The Prove It Act 
changes that, adding transparency and accountability to the process. If 
they are doing this analysis correctly, then there should be very 
little additional burden and no concern in making it public.
  This legislation gives small businesses a greater say in the 
regulatory process and will help ensure that agencies do their due 
diligence when considering how harmful their regulations are to Main 
Street.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, the Prove It Act is just the latest in a long line of 
Republican bills meant to undermine or block agency rulemaking. If this 
legislation is enacted, every single rule--past, present, and future--
would be funneled for review through a single official in a chronically 
underfunded office within the Small Business Administration. This one 
person would be granted unreviewable and unilateral power to block or 
suspend lifesaving regulations that ensure that we have clean air to 
breathe, clean water to drink, and safe food to eat.
  I urge Members to oppose this dangerous legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  There are several points that I think need to be made in relation to 
this bill, but also to the obvious misunderstanding not only of what 
the bill does but of the rulemaking process and procedure that occurs 
under the Administrative Procedure Act in this country right now.
  First of all, it applies to small businesses, not large businesses. 
By definition, it applies to small businesses. The allegation that this 
is going to somehow help these huge corporations is absolutely 
incorrect.
  In addition to which, the Prove It Act does not authorize the SBA to 
review the substantive policy of any particular regulation. Again, any 
allegation that this would allow the SBA to address the substantive 
aspect of a regulation is again incorrect. If the agency has complied 
with the RFA, then the regulation will apply to small businesses as 
normal.
  Here is something that I think is important. We often talk in the 
abstract about regulations and the regulatory impacts and regulatory 
agencies and unelected bureaucrats. Let's just talk about a real-life 
situation for once. Let's talk about what really happens when a 
regulation is adopted by an agency and the impact that it has on our 
small businesses.
  Let's use the USDA EID rule as an example. On November 5, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture issued a rule mandating electronic 
identification ear tags on cattle and bison. It will place a 
substantial burden on small ranchers when it goes into effect.
  The USDA, however, in assessing this rule, only completed a brief, 
two-page initial regulatory flexibility analysis, finding that using 
the Small Business Administration's guidelines that the majority of 
cattle operations in the United States are considered small. In other 
words, the majority of our ranching operations are considered small 
businesses.
  In 2013, when the USDA first considered imposing a rule like this, 
they estimated that the cost would be between $1.2 and $1.9 billion 
imposed against our small ranchers, yet in this latest analysis, they 
did a two-page RFA analysis. I can't imagine that anyone on the other 
side of the aisle would actually believe that that is adequate 
considering the circumstances and the fact that so many of our ranchers 
will be financially broken by such a rule.
  After acknowledging that the proposed rule would have a substantial 
impact on small businesses, the agency then conducted an insufficient 
analysis based upon outdated and incorrect information. This entire 
analysis relies on a cost estimate created by APHIS.

[[Page H6391]]

This estimate undervalues the cost to ranchers, and it has not even 
publicly disclosed how it calculated those costs.
  This example of avoiding the RFA requirements resulted in the USDA 
ignoring the true cost of the rule and how the burden is shouldered by 
our small businesses.
  The USDA and the ear-tag manufacturers are also wholly unprepared to 
alleviate the harm caused by the rule. In fact, many States have run 
out of the ear tags before even being able to provide them to the 
ranchers.

  Under the Prove It Act, the USDA would be required to account for the 
additional, reasonably foreseeable indirect costs that are borne by 
ranchers because of this rule, costs that the USDA is currently 
ignoring.
  The Prove It Act would give a voice to the ranchers and the 
organizations that represent them to point out the obvious flaws in 
APHIS's proposals, flaws which were ignored during the finalization of 
the rule.
  I think it is also incredibly important to understand that we are 
passing this bill today to help small businesses understand the true 
cost of compliance with regulations and to force regulators to be 
transparent when crafting their regulations.
  If this bill becomes law, regulators will have to come to terms with 
the enormous weight that they place on small businesses in the form of 
regulations. In fact, under the Biden-Harris administration, the 
regulatory burden in this country is approximately $2.1 trillion a 
year. It is almost $16,000 per household.
  I cannot understand, for the life of me, why anyone on the other side 
of the aisle would not want the agencies to have to disclose the real 
cost of these regulations. Maybe it is because they don't want the 
American public to understand the costs imposed by unelected 
bureaucrats. In an ideal world, regulators would think twice before 
imposing massive costs on our small businesses that are the lifeblood 
of so many of our communities.
  I also want to point out that the claim that this would slow down 
rulemaking is absolutely absurd. The Prove It Act is designed to ensure 
that agencies are complying with existing law, the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, when they are crafting their regulations. Agencies 
must already comply with the RFA's requirements. They are just not 
doing it, and this is a law that would force them to meet that 
requirement.
  The RFA has been the law since 1980. Why are we allowing these 
agencies to get away with ignoring the law as written by Congress?
  No agency can credibly claim that compliance with the RFA, which 
Congress enacted, improperly slows down the rulemaking process.
  I also want to point out the comment that this would result in a 
bottleneck created by these large corporations filing petition after 
petition after petition. Again, that argument is absurd. The claim that 
small businesses, large businesses, or trade associations would abuse 
the Prove It Act's petition mechanism is just simply misguided.
  The Prove It Act gives a method for the chief counsel for advocacy at 
the Small Business Administration to dismiss any petition that lacks 
merit. Following an initial review, the chief counsel can close the 
petition without any further action if the case does not warrant it.
  To be clear, big businesses are not allowed to petition the SBA under 
the Prove It Act. I would like to repeat that. Big businesses are not 
covered by this act.
  Finally, the CBO score. The CBO score for this bill is clearly wrong. 
The generic language that the CBO cites does not remotely support its 
finding that this bill will increase the deficit. CBO claims that 
direct spending would increase by $10 million, and Congress would need 
to appropriate an extra $35 million to Federal agencies for them to do 
much of the same work that they were supposed to be doing for the last 
40 years.
  Every Federal agency that engages in rulemaking should already have 
the staff and resources on board to comply with the law. The Prove It 
Act simply requires the already existing staff perform some additional 
analyses to report on the reasonably foreseeable indirect costs of 
their regulations. This should be relatively straightforward for the 
personnel already tasked with the RFA analysis.
  Finally, any agency that is burdened by the Prove It Act's 
requirements probably did not comply with the RFA in the first place.
  One of the things that I find so interesting in these debates about 
our efforts to force transparency and good government provisions on our 
agencies is often this discussion that it is going to destroy the air 
and water, we are going to have sick kids, the toys are going to be 
destroyed, and everything is going to be dangerous. That is absolutely 
absurd, and it is a red herring.
  There is nothing wrong with requiring our agencies to be transparent 
and up-front about the costs that they are imposing on our businesses 
when they adopt regulations. I am actually surprised that anyone would 
oppose the Prove It Act in light of what it is intended to do.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.


                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Velazquez

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
1 printed in House Report 118-791.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Prove It Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. TRAINING ON COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
                   REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT.

       Section 612 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--
       (1) in the section heading, by striking ``and intervention 
     rights'' and inserting ``, intervention rights, and 
     training''; and
       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
       ``(d) Not less frequently than once every 4 years, the 
     Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
     Administration shall provide training on compliance with the 
     requirements of this chapter for any agency employee who 
     writes, reviews, approves, or analyzes regulations or 
     guidance documents.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1602, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by reiterating that as the 
ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I recognize the impact 
of regulations, and I have worked to find ways to balance the shared 
goal of minimizing the burdens while achieving the intended effects of 
regulations.
  The Prove It Act doesn't strike that appropriate balance. It allows 
big corporations to block, delay, and weaken rules. Yes, the Chamber of 
Commerce or NFIB could file a petition and doesn't have to identify the 
business that they are representing, causing uncertainty and harm to 
small employers. It also gives unchecked authority to the SBA's chief 
counsel and tasks an understaffed and under-resourced Office of 
Advocacy with a cumbersome and lengthy review process.
  That is why I am offering a commonsense solution. My amendment will 
require the Office of Advocacy to train agencies on how to comply with 
their Regulatory Flexibility Act.
  Key personnel at every rule-writing agency would be required to 
undergo RFA training once every 4 years. We have heard from Advocacy 
that when agencies have a better understanding of the RFA, it leads to 
more meaningful consideration of small businesses throughout the 
rulemaking process. Advocacy has been working diligently to train 
staff, and we have seen the fruits of their labor year after year.
  Their training programs have made a significant difference in the 
rule-writing process, and requiring ongoing training will only lead to 
more success. Agencies have shared draft documents with Advocacy early 
in the rulemaking process, and Advocacy has worked to help agencies 
obtain reliable small business data. Their training program has led to 
much better analysis, and in many instances enhanced the factual basis 
for agency certifications or led to modifications to reduce the impact 
to small firms.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to foster a constructive working relationship 
between

[[Page H6392]]

Advocacy and Federal agencies rather than create an adversarial one. 
This amendment will ensure that Advocacy reaches all agencies on RFA 
compliance on a regular basis.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support my amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1315

  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  This amendment simply strikes the entire bill and replaces it with a 
training mandate. Claiming that training is all that is necessary to 
help agencies comply with their obligations under the RFA completely 
ignores the problems that the Prove It Act is going to solve.
  The Small Business Administration already offers training sessions 
for regulators and has done so for over 20 years. According to the SBA, 
they held nine training sessions and trained 139 Federal officials in 
2023 alone.
  Further, the SBA has already trained personnel at nearly every 
Federal agency and department since 2003. Despite this training, 
however, in 2023, SBA sent 46 letters to agencies across government 
outlining the deficiencies in their RFA analysis. In 30 cases, the SBA 
found that agencies conducted inadequate analysis of small business 
impacts.
  What this means is that during the rulemaking process for 30 rules, 
agencies did not comply with already existing law despite the SBA 
training they likely received.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, there are a few more points I would like to make.
  Despite SBA's best efforts to help agencies comply with their 
obligations under the RFA, those efforts are being ignored. Agencies 
have had 40 years to develop the experience and expertise necessary to 
comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and still regularly come up 
short.
  The claim that training is the answer is simply an attempt to 
distract from the importance of the Prove It Act. If we adopt this 
amendment and training is mandated instead of adopting the Prove It 
Act's provisions, nothing will change. Small businesses around the 
country will still be harmed by regulatory agencies blatantly ignoring 
their obligations under the RFA and discounting the costs of 
regulations.
  The only legitimate solution is to adopt the Prove It Act, which 
strengthens the RFA and creates mechanisms to force regulatory agencies 
to comply with the law.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rulli). Pursuant to the rule, the 
previous question is ordered on the bill and on the amendment offered 
by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. Velazquez).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings will be postponed.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
Kamlager-Dove) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 8413, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Smith's legislation, 
which would initiate a transfer of Federal lands under the jurisdiction 
of the Bureau of Reclamation to the Counties of Frontier and Hitchcock 
in southern Nebraska.
  This legislation was introduced at the counties' request with the 
hopes of gaining local control after disagreements arose between local 
stakeholders and the Bureau of Reclamation.
  The disagreement stemmed from the Bureau of Reclamation's decision to 
require the removal of mobile homes surrounding the reservoirs, an 
action that would significantly impact the local economy.
  The cost of this transfer has not yet been determined. However, an 
appraisal will be conducted, and the counties will be responsible for 
providing fair market value compensation for these lands.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Swanson and Hugh Butler 
Reservoirs Land Conveyances Act. This bill would authorize the 
Secretary of the Interior to enter into good faith negotiations with 
Hitchcock County and Frontier County in southern Nebraska to establish 
a title transfer agreement for certain lands within the Swanson 
Reservoir and Red Willow Reservoir lands.
  The Swanson Reservoir and Hugh Butler Reservoir serve as home to 
several communities and popular recreation sites. Transferring 
ownership of these lands from the Bureau of Reclamation to the counties 
will allow the counties to manage and develop the land for recreational 
use and conservation in alignment with the communities' needs.
  It is worth noting that there are some health and safety concerns at 
the concession areas that need to be met to increase public safety and 
access to recreation facilities.
  For that reason, the bill would require that prior to any conveyance, 
the local entities must demonstrate their ability to effectively 
operate, maintain, and enhance the lands for the same purposes for 
which they are currently being used and to establish a concrete plan to 
address health and safety concerns. This legislation will help improve 
the management of these sites for the surrounding communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the bill sponsor.
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the 
House Committee on Natural Resources. I appreciate this opportunity, 
and I appreciate their support of H.R. 8413.
  The Swanson and Hugh Butler Reservoirs Land Conveyances Act would 
begin the process of transferring ownership of roughly 77 acres of land 
from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Counties of Hitchcock and 
Frontier together. Importantly, this land does not include any water or 
power assets.
  I am proud to represent Nebraska's Third District, which is home to 
both reservoirs impacted by this legislation. Over the last few years, 
working closely with impacted stakeholders, as well as Senator Deb 
Fischer, it is clear how important this transfer is to the local 
communities.
  The current management of the land supports local marinas, housing 
communities, and areas for local economic activity. However, should the 
Bureau of Reclamation maintain ownership, impending changes to land use 
policy would force the removal of these businesses and communities from 
the land.
  When the Bureau of Reclamation announced the planned management 
changes, it spawned extensive collaboration between the local 
communities, businesses, and housing owners. This collaboration 
generated outstanding support for a land transfer that would allow for 
increased local control of the recreational areas.
  Further, this would provide long-term certainty for the businesses 
that depend on revenue brought in by tourism, the locals who enjoy 
recreational activities at the reservoirs, and some 180 housing owners 
from three States. These owners and their families have spent 
generations creating these homes away from home.
  Tourism cultivated by current land use arrangements is vital for the 
local economies. Both counties are highly rural, with Frontier County 
covering over 700 square miles with just 2,600 residents. There are 
three restaurants in the entire county, one of which is a marina 
included in this transfer.
  The 110 leaseholders at Swanson Reservoir bring in approximately 500 
people multiple times throughout the year who support other local 
businesses in the area as well.
  To put this into perspective, small businesses throughout Frontier 
and Hitchcock Counties estimate they would lose nearly $1.5 million in 
revenue if these leases are terminated. Additionally, the marinas 
facilitate community activities and drive economic development, which 
would not occur if not for the patronage generated from the broader 
communities.
  When the public and the Federal Government disagree on how land 
intended for public access should be used, the reasonable solution is 
to empower local control, which best suits the local community and 
visitors, especially considering all the discussion here this 
afternoon.

  Additionally, the transfer comes at no cost to the Federal 
Government, as the legislation ensures taxpayers are reimbursed at fair 
market value and public access is maintained.

[[Page H6395]]

  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for their work to 
move this bill forward and certainly Senator Fischer for her 
partnership in the Senate, and I urge passage of H.R. 8413.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8413 provides a solution to a 
dispute between Frontier and Hitchcock Counties and the Bureau of 
Reclamation. These reservoirs, among other benefits, provide valuable 
recreational access to over 57,000 acres available for public hunting 
and fishing.
  I thank Representative Smith and all of Nebraska's congressional 
delegation members for their leadership on this issue. I encourage all 
Members to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8413, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

     correctly determined which small entities will be affected by 
     the proposed rule;
       ``(ii) whether the agency considered adequate economic data

     an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and a final 
     regulatory flexibility analysis for the proposed rule under

       ``(4) Penalty.--If an agency fails to attend the required 
     meeting under paragraph (1)(B) or in any other way fails to

     of that determination to complete the review of the rule 
     under this section; and

           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE

  Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to raise a question of the privileges 
of the House and offer a resolution previously noticed.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                              H. Res. 1608

       Whereas on April 9, 2021, the Committee on Ethics of the 
     House of Representatives announced that it had begun to 
     investigate allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may 
     have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, 
     shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, 
     misused State identification records, converted campaign 
     funds for personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper 
     gratuity, or impermissible gift in violation of the Rules of 
     the House, laws, or other standards of conduct;
       Whereas over three years, the Committee on Ethics of the 
     House of Representatives compiled an extensive investigative 
     record pursuant to Committee Rules 14(a)(3) and 18(a) into 
     allegations that Representative Gaetz may have engaged in 
     sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper 
     gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals 
     with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to 
     obstruct government investigations of his conduct;
       Whereas on November 13, 2024, Representative Matt Gaetz 
     announced his resignation from Congress;
       Whereas there is precedent for the Committee on Ethics of 
     the House of Representatives to continue investigating and 
     release reports of its investigations into former Members of 
     the House of Representatives;
       Whereas in 1987, the Committee on Ethics of the House of 
     Representatives released a report on its investigation into 
     allegations of the misuse of campaign funds, improper gifts, 
     the failure to reveal business interests on his financial 
     disclosure, and the acceptance of a bribe by former 
     Representative Bill Boner following his resignation from 
     Congress;
       Whereas in 1990, the Committee on Ethics of the House of 
     Representatives released a report on its investigations of 
     sexual misconduct allegations, which included having sexual 
     intercourse with a minor and making sexual advances towards a 
     congressional employee, against former Representative Don 
     Lukens following his resignation from Congress;
       Whereas in 2006, the Committee on Ethics of the House of 
     Representatives released a report on its investigation of 
     sexual misconduct allegations, which included sending 
     sexually explicit messages to at least one minor, against 
     former Representative Mark Foley following his resignation 
     from Congress;
       Whereas in 2011, the Committee on Ethics of the House of 
     Representatives continued its investigation into allegations 
     of sexual misconduct against former Representative Eric Massa 
     following his resignation from Congress; and
       Whereas given the serious nature of the allegations against 
     Representative Gaetz, a failure of the Committee on Ethics of 
     the House of Representatives to publicly release its report 
     on its investigation undermines the committee's credibility 
     and impedes the safety, dignity, and integrity of the 
     legislative proceedings of the House: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Committee on Ethics of the House of 
     Representatives shall immediately release the latest draft of 
     its report and a summary of its findings to the public, 
     including any conclusions, draft reports, recommendations, 
     attachments, exhibits and accompanying materials, with such 
     redactions as may be necessary and appropriate to protect 
     sensitive information, including witness identities, related 
     to its investigation into allegations against former 
     Representative Matt Gaetz.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution qualifies.


                            Motion to Refer

  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk to refer the 
resolution to the Committee on Ethics.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Mr. Scalise of Louisiana moves to refer the resolution to 
     the Committee on Ethics.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized 
for 1 hour.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, the Member being referenced in the 
resolution has actually resigned from the House of Representatives. 
Therefore, the question is moot.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to refer, and I 
yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question.
  The previous question was ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to refer.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 206, 
nays 198, not voting 29, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 490]

           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to hope that about nine Republicans 
leave and don't vote, and I rise to a question of the privileges of the 
House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                              H. Res. 1609

       Whereas Matthew Louis Gaetz II of Florida served in the 
     House of Representatives from January 3, 2017 through 
     November 13, 2024;
       Whereas clause 2 of section 5 of article I of the 
     Constitution of the United States establishes that ``Each 
     House may determine the Rules of its proceedings'' and 
     ``punish its members for disorderly Behavior'';
       Whereas clause 3(a)(2) of rule XI of the Rules of the House 
     of Representatives provides the Committee on Ethics the 
     authority to investigate alleged violations ``by a Member, 
     Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the 
     House of the Code of Official Conduct or of a law, rule, 
     regulation, or other standard of conduct applicable to the 
     conduct of such Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, 
     officer, or employee in the performance of the duties or the 
     discharge of the responsibilities of such individual'';
       Whereas on April 9, 2021, the Committee on Ethics initiated 
     a review of allegations that Representative Gaetz may have 
     ``engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, 
     shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, 
     misused state identification records, converted campaign 
     funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper 
     gratuity, or impermissible gift, in violation of House Rules, 
     laws, or other standards of conduct'' in violation of Federal 
     law and the Rules of the House;
       Whereas on June 18, 2024, the Committee on Ethics released 
     a statement acknowledging the Committee's continued review of 
     allegations that Representative Gaetz may have ``engaged in 
     sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper 
     gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals 
     with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to 
     obstruct government investigations of his conduct''; and
       Whereas if Representative Gaetz engaged in the alleged 
     violations while serving as a Member of the House, such 
     conduct would affect the rights of the House of 
     Representatives and the integrity of the legislative process: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Committee on Ethics shall--
       (1) preserve all documents and investigative materials 
     related to any review of Matthew Louis Gaetz II's conduct 
     while serving

[[Page H6402]]

     as a Member of the House of Representatives;
       (2) publicly release the Committee's report, including any 
     associated findings, recommendations, and proposed 
     disciplinary actions, as discussed by the Committee on 
     November 20, 2024, regarding the alleged violations of the 
     Code of Official Conduct of the House or of a law, rule, 
     regulation, or other standard of conduct by Matthew Louis 
     Gaetz II while serving as a Member of the House of 
     Representatives; and
       (3) in accordance with the Committee's practice for 
     releasing public documents, anonymize witness identities and 
     redact any personally identifiable information of minors and 
     victims from any House documents associated with this matter 
     before publicly releasing them.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution qualifies.


                            Motion to Refer

  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk to refer the 
resolution to the Committee on Ethics.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Mr. Scalise of Louisiana moves to refer the resolution to 
     the Committee on Ethics.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Louisiana is recognized 
for 1 hour.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we have heard enough on this. We can talk 
about it for an hour, four hours. The bottom line, Mr. Speaker: Why 
don't we get back to work for the people of this country.
  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to refer. I yield back the 
balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the motion to 
refer.
  The previous question was ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to refer.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.


                             Recorded Vote

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
  A recorded vote was ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 204, 
noes 198, not voting 31, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 491]

          CONGRATULATING DR. GEORGE HANBURY ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise and 
recognize the distinguished career of Dr. George Hanbury, the president 
and CEO of Nova Southeastern University.
  Since 2010, Dr. Hanbury guided this institution with vision, 
integrity, and a true dedication to excellence. His impact is evident 
in the growth, innovation, and spirit that defines NSU, its students, 
faculty, staff, and alumni.
  During his tenure, NSU established a state-of-the-art teaching 
hospital. It also opened the Levan Center of Innovation for startup 
businesses and student entrepreneurship. It became the third university 
nationwide to offer both osteopathic and allopathic medical degrees in 
2018.
  Dr. Hanbury also established the President's 64, an elite group of 
student leaders with the purpose to strengthen the relationship between 
the university and its community. During a recent interview, he said 
his 27 years at NSU is ``the most noble thing I have ever done.''
  I wish him well on his retirement and thank him for, the thoughtful 
and committed work he has done to enrich the students and faculty at 
Nova Southeastern University.

                      REMEMBERING BRYCE A. JOHNSON

  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life of Bryce A. Johnson, who passed away suddenly this week at the age 
of 52. He was a husband to Erika, father to Will, son to Terry, and a 
friend to me.
  He was a dedicated public servant who served as the Tifton Judicial 
Circuit District Attorney. In addition to his legal career, his love 
for our country and politics led him to teach history and political 
science to students at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. He also 
had a passion for Georgia high school football and cohosted a local 
Friday night high school football radio show for about 15 years.
  Bryce was one of those guys that no matter what team he was on or 
what group he was in, the organization was better because of him. Bryce 
was a genuinely good person who will be missed by those of us who had 
the privilege to know him.

                       VETERANS AFFAIRS DOGE CUTS

  (Mr. DELUZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I am all for protecting public money, 
fighting price gouging in the defense industry and others. I am not for 
the Department of Government Efficiency going after veterans' 
healthcare to pay for billionaire tax handouts.
  I use the VA for my care, as do thousands of my constituents in 
western Pennsylvania. Yet, DOGE proposes cutting $119 billion from 
veterans' healthcare. That is more than a third of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs' budget. That is all types of healthcare: surgical, 
specialty care, dental care, counseling for combat veterans, and more. 
It is ridiculous.
  My question to my friends on the other side of the aisle, President-
elect Trump, and others is this: Do you want to cut healthcare for 
veterans who risked their lives for this country? If not, you should 
say you don't. You should stand up against this. If you do, folks like 
me are going to fight you every step of the way. This is the cost of 
war, and this country expects us to pay it.

             RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lopez) laid before the House the 
following resignation from the House of Representatives:

                                Congress of the United States,

                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker of the House,
     Washington, DC
       Dear Mr. Speaker: Enclosed is my resignation letter to New 
     Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, effective December 8, 2024. It 
     has been the honor of my life to serve New Jersey's Third 
     Congressional District. I'm grateful to the people of New 
     Jersey for entrusting me with the great honor of representing 
     them in the United States Senate and I hope to do so with 
     humility and integrity.
           Sincerely,
                                                         Andy Kim,
     Member of Congress.
                                  ____



                                Congress of the United States,

                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2024.
     Gov. Philip D. Murphy,
     125 West State Street
     Trenton, NJ.
       Dear Governor Murphy, It is an honor and privilege to have 
     been chosen by the people of New Jersey to serve them in the 
     United States Senate. As you know, Senator Helmy has 
     announced his intention to resign so that New Jerseyans may 
     have their duly elected representation in the United States 
     Senate as soon as possible. I, therefore, write to submit my 
     resignation from the United States House of Representatives, 
     effective December 8, 2024.
       It has been the honor of my life to serve New Jersey's 
     Third Congressional District, its people, and the community 
     that raised me for these past six years. I look forward to 
     the opportunity to serve the entirety of our state and I hope 
     to do so with humility and integrity.
       I thank you for your leadership and the opportunity.
           Sincerely,
                                                         Andy Kim,
     Member of Congress.

                 RECOGNIZING CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE LESKO

  (Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
my dear friend and colleague, Debbie Lesko, whom I have known for the 
past 6-plus years.
  Debbie is such a hard worker. She has done so much incredible work 
serving her constituents in Arizona. She has done wonderful things for 
her State. For years, she served on the community committee for the 
Peoria Unified School District and later ran for school board.
  From 2008 to 2018, she served in the Arizona legislature for 9 years, 
both in the house and the senate, where she received special 
recognition such as Champion of the Taxpayer, Guardian of Small 
Business, and Senator of the Year from various organizations, due to 
her outstanding work.
  Debbie has served on several subcommittees within the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce during her time in the House of Representatives. 
She has served on several caucuses and founded the wonderful Protect 
Kids Caucus. In the 118th Congress, House Majority Whip   Tom Emmer 
appointed her as a member of the whip team.
  Some of Debbie's bills, including the Hands Off Our Home Appliances 
Act and the United States Ports of Entry Threat and Operational Review 
Act have either successfully passed in the House or become law.
  She led a delegation to Taiwan where we had many discussions about 
the importance of ensuring their independence from China. We also had a 
lot of fun!
  Debbie has achieved many great things over the years and has made a 
positive impact while partaking in politics. I can attest to this 
firsthand as we sat next to each other for nearly every vote and would 
often discuss policy on the House floor.
  She has accomplished so much in her work, and I am sure that she 
would say her greatest achievements in life are being a mother to her 
children and a

[[Page H6404]]

grandmother to her beautiful grandchildren. As a mother and 
grandmother, myself, I know how much of a blessing family is.
  I wish there could be more opportunities for us to work together 
Debbie, but I know you will do a fantastic job as you enter your next 
chapter of life serving as Maricopa County Supervisor.
  Thank you for your commitment to helping make Arizona a better place 
to live, for helping our nation, and for upholding conservative values.
  We will all miss you!

                          ____________________

                  CELEBRATING BLUE COLLIE COFFEE SHOP

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Disability 
Awareness Month, we celebrate the inspiring work of Blue Collie Coffee 
Shop in Louisburg, North Carolina.
  Since creating Blue Collie Coffee Shop, Al and Paige Sayles have 
provided meaningful employment opportunities for individuals with 
intellectual and developmental disabilities. Blue Collie has employed 
over 16 individuals, helping them gain meaningful skills and confidence 
while fostering an inclusive work environment where everyone has a 
chance to thrive.
  Al and Paige's dedication to creating opportunities and building a 
more inclusive community is nothing short of remarkable. Their work 
transforms lives, opening doors and breaking down barriers one cup of 
coffee at a time. I thank Al and Paige.

              HONORING THE LATE CORPORAL MATTHEW A. WYATT

  (Ms. MANNING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Corporal 
Matthew A. Wyatt.
  After graduating high school in June 2001, Corporal Wyatt made the 
courageous decision to serve his country. He joined the Marine Corps, 
where he was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before deploying 
to Iraq.
  On December 3, 2004, Corporal Wyatt gave his life to stop an enemy 
attack on his base. He was only 21 years old. Corporal Wyatt bravely 
acted without hesitation to save the lives of his fellow 
servicemembers.
  Today, his memory is carried forward by his father, Marine Gunnery 
Sergeant Alan Wyatt; his mother, Verlene; and the entire family, who 
proudly uphold the three-generation legacy of military service.
  Corporal Wyatt's stepmother, Lauren, also continues to honor his 
legacy through her work in my district office, where she serves 
veterans and military families, ensuring they receive the support they 
need.
  To pay tribute to Corporal Wyatt's sacrifice, I am proud to support 
legislation to rename the United States Post Office in his hometown of 
Millstadt, Illinois, in his honor. While no act of gratitude will ever 
be enough to fill the void left by Corporal Wyatt's absence, I hope 
this naming will comfort his loved ones and remind them that his 
sacrifice will not be forgotten.

                        THANK YOU TO JO-ANN YOO

  (Mr. GOLDMAN of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOLDMAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
heartfelt gratitude to Jo-Ann Yoo for her lifetime of public service on 
behalf of the AAPI community in my district and the entire city of New 
York.
  This year, Jo-Ann will retire after 13 years as executive director of 
the Asian American Federation, an organization dedicated to supporting 
the 1.5 million Asian-American community members in New York City.
  Under Jo-Ann's leadership, the AAF played a leading role in combating 
the horrific rise in anti-Asian hate in 2020, organizing and ensuring 
local community response to provide safety to AAPI New Yorkers.
  Jo-Ann testified at a public briefing held by the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights on the Federal response to anti-Asian hate, and she serves 
on New York City's Advisory Board on Implementation of Racial Justice 
Commission, working to end hate and discrimination of all kinds in our 
city.
  Jo-Ann leaves behind a lasting legacy of spirit, courage, 
determination, and advocacy that will be felt for decades to come. 
Thanks to Jo-Ann, New York City is a better and far more tolerant 
place.

         SERVING IN CONGRESS HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF MY LIFETIME

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
to submit extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Arizona?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  It has been the honor of my lifetime to serve in these sacred Halls 
of the U.S. House of Representatives. Part of that great honor is to 
serve with fantastic colleagues, Members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
  I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), my great 
colleague.
  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend, the 
gentlewoman from Arizona, Debbie Lesko, Representative Debbie Lesko.
  Representative Lesko has served Arizona's Eighth Congressional 
District with distinction and honor. She has fought for Arizonans and 
all Americans and has been a champion for the people she represents.
  It has been my honor serving with Representative Lesko in the Arizona 
delegation. As a colleague, we frequently collaborated as advocates on 
behalf of communities in Arizona.
  It is an honor to stand here tonight before you and tell my friend 
Debbie Lesko how much she means to me and how much I am going to miss 
her in these hallowed Halls of the House of Representatives.
  However, I am heartened. I know she won't be too far away, and you 
can bet I am going to continue to phone her whenever I need her advice 
or just to talk.
  More importantly, I am confident her character, demeanor, and 
principles will continue to serve her well in Maricopa County, where 
she has been recently elected to the Board of Supervisors. However, I 
am worried about it. In Congress, Debbie represented 800,000 people 
with full-time staff, but now she will represent over a million people 
with just one full-time employee. DOGE should learn something from you.
  Congress' loss is Maricopa's gain. I am grateful to have had the 
opportunity to serve with her. I applaud her for her service and wish 
her all the best. Arizona is a better place because of Debbie Lesko.
  May God bless her and her husband, Joe.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Gosar for his 
remarks. It means so much to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton), 
another colleague.
  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to send off my colleague, 
Debbie Lesko, and honor her long career in public service.
  I first got to know Debbie when she was working on pension reform as 
a State senator and I was working on pension reform as mayor of the 
city of Phoenix.
  We were both elected to Congress in the year 2018, and over the last 
6 years, we have probably canceled each other's votes out more often 
than not.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. Speaker, you know what? We have developed a really great 
friendship, spending so many hours together, talking about our families 
and politics at Sky Harbor International Airport and DCA as we wait to 
board our weekly flights back and forth to Washington.

[[Page H6405]]

  I want to say something about Debbie. She inspires me. She is a 
survivor of domestic violence, and she got out of an abusive marriage.
  Do you know what she did?
  She poured herself into our community on the Peoria school board, at 
the State legislature, and now as a Member of the United States 
Congress. That is a great American success story.
  Over her years in public office, she has shown immense courage in 
sharing her story as a domestic violence survivor and using her office 
to fight for other survivors to receive the care and attention they 
deserve.
  To Debbie's husband, Joe, I see you on those weekly flights. It is 
not easy being a congressional spouse. I see the long hours you put in, 
in supporting Debbie. Thank you for sharing her with us.
  I am going to miss Debbie in Congress, but she is continuing her work 
in public service as a newly elected Maricopa County supervisor. 
Debbie, I have one request in your new role. Please don't ever let the 
Cyber Ninjas back in Maricopa County.
  In all seriousness, I am wishing you all the very best. Godspeed, 
Congresswoman Lesko.
  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you so much, Representative Stanton. I greatly 
appreciate the words. I will tell Joe, as well.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my 
friend and colleague who I have known for many years.
  Mr. BIGGS. Thank you. You didn't have to put the ``many'' in front of 
that, Debbie.
  It is true. She was a young child when we first met.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak and recognize my good friend, 
Debbie. When I was serving from the east side of the valley and Debbie 
got elected to the school board, I started hearing about Debbie Lesko 
is going to be this great conservative politico. I did not know Debbie 
at that time, but I got to observe her. Then we ended up serving in the 
State legislature together, and she was dynamic and exciting and 
actually conservative.
  As Greg mentioned, she worked on pension reform. The bulk of that 
took place after I left, thankfully, because pension reform, as anybody 
who has ever done it knows, is one ugly thing and takes a lot of 
courage. Debbie exhibited courage, and I would get reports on how she 
was doing that.
  She brought in people with very disparate interests. She worked with 
them. She got them on board, and she would tell them where the rubber 
met the road. That was really awesome.
  Then I am here, and then the next thing I know, Debbie is here with 
me. The bad news for me is that she is going home to Maricopa County. 
She is going to do a great job there.
  This is great news for Maricopa County which, by the way, is one of 
the largest counties in the country. It is about, what, 5.5 million 
people in the county, something like that, with only five supervisors.
  Debbie has told me this. I know she has told Paul this. I know she 
has told Greg this, and I know she has told David and Juan this: she 
only has one-and-a-half staffers. That is really bugging her. I can 
tell you that. She is going to do a great job.
  She has been a great friend.
  I will also pay homage to Joe and Debbie's family who have been so 
supportive, literally, for many years.
  So with that, I----
  Mrs. LESKO. Don't make me cry, Andy.
  Mr. BIGGS. I am like Winston Churchill. I am a crier.
  Debbie, Cindy and I love you.
  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you very much, Andy.
  Congressman Biggs, you are a great friend. Thank you so much. We will 
be working many years together. I am going to keep calling you.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. 
Harshbarger).
  Diana and I sit with each other in the women's row. And sometimes 
guys want to, you know, infiltrate, and we kick them out.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Exactly. Exactly.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work and legacy of my dear 
friend and colleague, Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, from the great State 
of Arizona.
  I have had the privilege of working alongside Congresswoman Lesko for 
almost 4 years. In that time, I have had the opportunity to get to know 
her, working on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the caucuses we 
share.
  Congresswoman Lesko is a true civil servant, leader, and dedicated 
mother and grandmother to a wonderful family. I know they will be 
grateful to be able to spend more time with her at home.
  Throughout her career in Congress, Mrs. Lesko has dedicated herself 
to defending the very principles that our Nation was founded upon. She 
stood up for religious freedom, speaking boldly in favor of faith-based 
institutions faced with encroachments from the Federal Government.
  She has defended life, introducing legislation to prevent the 
dismemberment of unborn children in the womb. She stood up for justice, 
launching the Protect Kids Caucus to defend the innocent children in 
our schools' healthcare and government programs.
  Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Lesko's unwavering commitment to faith, 
family, and freedom has left an incredible mark on these Halls and the 
lives of countless Americans. While her leadership will be deeply 
missed, her legacy of service will continue to be remembered for years 
to come.
  Thank you, Debbie, for being a wonderful friend to me. I will miss 
you.
  We are going to charge for the seat you are going to vacate if 
somebody wants to sit there. Okay?

  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you very much, Diana. I greatly appreciate it.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), 
my colleague who is sitting to my left, who I have known for a long 
time, too. I went to your wedding reception, I think.
  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, one of the magic things about Debbie 
Lesko is she has proven you can be conservative and not be angry about 
it. You can actually be joyful and kind and sweet and just a decent 
human being. I have learned more things about urban chickens from her, 
because I have a 9-year-old that really wants daddy to build a chicken 
coop. Don't laugh. She really does.
  Just an observation, because we sit on this airplane every week, 
flying back, and I often sit next to Debbie. Other Members, you see 
them on their computers, watching movies. Debbie has a stack of things 
because she doesn't use her computer. She has a stack of papers. You 
know, they do make these things called laptops.
  She is there with her highlighter for hours on the airplane. That is 
the sort of thing you notice. You can be kind. You can be loving. You 
can be joyful.
  Debbie, I think you are going to have an amazing experience with the 
leadership of Maricopa County. Remember, Maricopa County is right now 
the fourth most populous county in America. I actually still believe it 
is going to cross over Harris County's population. If there weren't so 
many hurricanes in the area, we probably would have already.
  I used to be the county treasurer, and trust me, after some years 
around here, I miss those days when you could actually do things.
  I am going to miss you. I am going to miss the times when you were my 
guiding light. When I am just mad, because I seem to be mad a lot, you 
just sort of smile and say, well, that is sort of how it is.
  I think you are going to do amazing things for the people of the West 
Valley as their supervisor. We are going to make some very tough 
decisions here in the next couple of years where we are going to need 
the leadership at our State and local levels because we don't have a 
lot of dollars to send. So we are going to send a lot of our problems 
to you soon.
  We love you, Debbie.
  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you very much, David. I greatly appreciate the 
friendship and the work we have done together.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani) my 
other Arizona colleague.
  Juan used to work for Governor Ducey, and that is how I met him. He 
is such a great Member of Congress, and I am so happy he got reelected 
because he is in a tough swing district.
  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor 
and pay tribute to my good friend, Debbie

[[Page H6406]]

Lesko, who has been an inspiration to so many.
  We worked on different projects together. You have been a speaker and 
a panelist for some of the programs that Laura and I have done for 
youth and especially for women. I think you are a shining example.
  A lot has been said by those that worked closest with you, which are, 
of course, our colleagues from the Arizona delegation. They have talked 
about your wit, your grace, your smile, the way in which you carry 
yourself and how you execute our priorities and our conservative 
values.
  As has been said before, you are conservative. You are just not angry 
about it. You have gone out there and have done the work and have put 
in the time.
  Seeing you on that plane, you and Joe many times, is great. I would 
much rather sit next to you than next to David or Greg. I enjoy those 
trips back home when I get a chance to sit with you. You are a hard 
worker, giving your best to your constituents every single time. Even 
those who live in the southern part of the State, like myself and 
others, we have really admired your work the entire time.
  I know you are going to do great things for Maricopa County, as well, 
and the entire State. Laura, our six kids, and I, wish you the very 
best in your next journey.
  You were a great source for me in my freshman year when I had 
questions, from the most basic ones to the most complex ones. Your 
peace and the way you tackled these issues was always very inspiring, 
but it also gave me a great deal of confidence in what we could do with 
this place.
  You have been a great mentor and a great friend. Thank you so much. 
We love you, and we are going to miss you. Thank you.
  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you so much, Juan. I am going to be calling you 
when I need help from the county.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), 
my friend and colleague who is on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
I serve as his vice chair on the Oversight and Investigation 
Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and 
colleague from Arizona's Eighth District, Congresswoman Debbie Lesko.
  I have had the distinct pleasure of serving alongside her, as she 
just told you, on the Energy and Commerce Committee and, more 
specifically, on the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, 
which I chair. She served this Congress as the vice chair of that 
subcommittee.
  We explored and investigated many important issues, some of which 
included COVID-19 origins. She did some more work on that. There were 
investigations into drug shortages and the potential exploitation of 
unaccompanied minors crossing our southern border. Her work with me 
related to world anti-doping in sports was outstanding. It was really 
very much appreciated.
  Everyone here who has spoken already knows this. For those folks 
watching at home, this is one smart, tough lady. I have really, really 
enjoyed working with her on a number of issues over her terms here in 
Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, her hard work and her strong conservative record is 
obviously appreciated back home. As you have heard others say, she just 
recently won election to a seat on the Maricopa County Board of 
Supervisors.

  I congratulate you, Debbie, on a fantastic career in the United 
States House, and I applaud your decision to continue public service a 
little bit closer to home as a member of the board of supervisors in 
Maricopa County.
  Your work will be missed, and it is appreciated. It also will be 
missed when we reconvene and start trying to tackle some tough issues, 
whether it be healthcare or telecom or whatever Energy and Commerce has 
jurisdiction over.
  I thank you for your service. I appreciate you.
  Mrs. LESKO. Thank you very much, Morgan. I appreciate you. You always 
have a great legal mind, and I come to you for legal questions. You are 
a great person. Thank you.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. You are very kind, thank you. You, likewise, are a 
great human being.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
Guthrie), my friend and colleague who serves on the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce.
  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend, 
Debbie Lesko, and her service to our country.
  What a great Member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I have 
to say I know that people should be excited that she is going to come 
back home and serve.
  We are really disappointed that you are leaving because you are so 
good at what you do. As many speakers have said tonight, you are a 
fighter. You are absolutely conservative, and you are a fighter. You 
always bring people along with you. You can track people because you 
want to bring them into the fold and not try to fight everybody outside 
of the tent.
  It has just been a pleasure working with you and your grasp of issues 
and the way you work before big hearings. You know Debbie is going to 
be prepared. You know Debbie is going to be there and is going to make 
things happen. It has just been a great privilege.

                              {time}  1845

  I remember when you said that you were running for county supervisor 
in Maricopa County, I first thought is--because I used to serve in the 
state legislature, and every legislative body in the country is so 
vital and so important--I couldn't help but think I first thought, you 
are going to leave the United States House of Representatives and serve 
in county government. It just shows that it is not a title to you. It 
is how you can best serve.
  It just means a lot. I had friends of mine and others who say: Do you 
think I should run for this or the other? I'd say: You are doing a 
great job where you are. Every level of government is important.
  I remember when Janice Hahn--I don't know if you remember when she 
was here--she left to go be on the L.A. Board of Supervisors. I said: 
You are leaving to go back to run for the county board? And she said 
that it is bigger than a congressional district. Yours probably is, as 
well, or close to it.
  It is a great privilege to be here to know that I am with someone who 
is about service, not about her own title.
  We are going to miss you. I am going to say that first and foremost, 
but we are also excited for you. We are excited for the people of 
Maricopa County because they are getting one heck of a fighter. They 
are getting one heck of a believer.
  They are getting somebody that is going to give all their heart and 
soul. We are going to miss you here, but they are going to love you 
there, as they already do, but they are going to love having you home. 
God bless you. You are a dear friend.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, this is kind of overwhelming, but I will 
yield next to one of my friends and one of the ladies that sits next to 
me in our women's row over here, my friend and colleague from Illinois 
(Mrs. Miller).
  Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work 
and legacy of my friend, Representative Debbie Lesko. It has been such 
a pleasure to serve with her in the 117th and 118th Congress.
  When I first arrived, Representative Lesko was the most generous with 
her time, helping me navigate my way, answering questions, and offering 
advice. I was so grateful.
  Representative Lesko is a genuinely good person, a true servant of 
our country, and a smart and fine lady also. I thank her for that 
example that she has given.
  Representative Lesko has a sincere care for our children and our 
grandchildren, and wants to make sure that they are left with a legacy 
and access to the freedom and opportunities that we have all had to 
pursue the American Dream.
  Debbie, I wish you all the best as you go back to Maricopa County, 
Arizona, to serve the good people there.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I remember when Michelle came in, we shared 
someone that helped us with our campaign, and she said you need to meet 
Michelle. I met her, and I thought she was great, and I have ever 
since.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague from Minnesota (Mrs. 
Fischbach).
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Mrs. Lesko for her

[[Page H6407]]

service. I have been honored to serve with Debbie.
  She mentioned we met before I was elected, but I have to admit, it 
was in a nail salon the first time we met. Nobody else here can say 
that.
  I know that so many of the speakers have talked about Debbie's 
service. It has been incredible. They have really honored you with that 
and talked about that.
  I want to say, one of the things I just love about Debbie is I have 
never seen her in a bad mood--never seen her in a bad mood. I was her 
whip representative, so I had to come and ask her how she was voting. 
She always has a smile on her face.
  I congratulate you on your new role in Arizona. I think that the 
people of Arizona and you county are going to be so incredibly well-
served. You will do a wonderful job for them.
  I thank her for her service in Congress and thank her for her 
friendship and her kindness. I have been so grateful for the guidance 
you gave me as a freshman, and I am sure so many others, because that 
is the kind of person you are.
  I think she is especially happy that I was elected because I took her 
spot on the Rules Committee. I am incredibly grateful that I have been 
able to call her a friend for the last 4 years. I have no doubt that 
she is going to continue to do incredible things in her public service.
  I know you are excited about this new chapter. You are going to be 
missed here. Come and visit occasionally. God bless, and all the best 
in the world to you.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, this lady, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is just 
an energizer bunny. Every place I go, she is there. I don't even know 
how she does it.
  I yield to a friend and fellow Energy and Commerce Committee 
colleague. I remember we were on a boat somewhere and flying through--
it was raining like heck, and I think she had a towel or something over 
her face. I don't know, but it was quite the experience.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).
  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Debbie Lesko, 
Representative Lesko.
  Although I am not from Arizona, I would wonderfully be in Arizona to 
have her as my Representative.
  Yes, indeed, we were on a boat in Grand Lake in Oklahoma for a Heat 
and Western Caucus event. You don't think of Oklahoma as being cold. It 
was cold and rainy and nasty, but we were troopers, and we were out 
there.
  My next interaction with Mrs. Lesko was approaching her about 
steering and how to get on the Energy and Commerce Committee. She was 
gracious, kind, knowledgeable, a tremendous mentor, as she was to 
everybody. Honestly, I don't think I have ever seen Debbie smile as 
much as I have seen her tonight and as I have watched this on video.
  Getting on the Energy and Commerce Committee, she was just one tier 
above me. Although, I had served on the Select Subcommittee on the 
Coronavirus Crisis my first term between 2021 and 2022, she then came 
on the committee this term; so we were serving in the 118th Congress 
both on Energy and Commerce and on the Select Subcommittee on the 
Coronavirus Crisis.
  You have heard a lot about her kindness, her mentoring, and her 
friendship. You have heard about her grace. You have heard how she is 
conservative, but not angry. That is such a great description of her.
  What you didn't hear a lot about was her intellect. Debbie studies. 
She is smart. She is able to dissect through things. She is able to 
prioritize. She is able to condense very complex topics into a 5-minute 
question and answer period.
  I am telling you, if you are the witness and you are giving 
testimony, you don't want to be on the bad side of Debbie Lesko. She 
won't be angry. She won't be vindictive. She won't use profanity, but 
you are going to know you have been taken to the cleaners.
  She will come out with a statement. She will smile. She will lead up 
to it, and then, bam. You are going: Where did that come from? That is 
Debbie Lesko. That is the power of Debbie Lesko. That is the power of 
preparation.
  In my time in the military, you learn: If you failed the plan, you 
planned to fail. She always plans. She is always on target. She always 
studies. She always reads. And quite honestly, isn't that what we, as 
Americans, want of our Congress people? If they are going to make laws, 
if they are going to hold government accountable, don't we want people 
that do the work that their constituents ask them to do? She is a role 
model for all of us and an inspiration on what a citizen servant should 
be.
  Next, if you get to travel with her, you don't have to go on a boat 
in the rain in Oklahoma. You can go to some far-off country. She is a 
great shopping companion. She likes to try all different kinds of 
foods. She does her homework on the plane over and on the plane back.
  She is just a genuine and lovely person to travel and be with. When 
Members of Congress have to travel places, especially far off, for the 
work that they do, you really want to have somebody in the seat next to 
you that is a joy to be with and not making all kinds of noises and all 
kinds of stuff. They are not high maintenance. She is a shining example 
of what a good travel companion and what a good Member of Congress is.
  I am probably over my time. It has been a real joy to serve with 
Debbie Lesko these 4 years I have served with her. She was a tremendous 
asset to the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Select Subcommittee 
on the Coronavirus Crisis that we served on together. She will be 
deeply missed. I will deeply miss her. She will be missed in our 
Conference for all of the reasons that everybody has said.
  Mr. Speaker, we know she is going to continue to do great things for 
the people of Arizona. We wish her all the best. I know her husband is 
very happy to have her back.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, serving in the U.S. House of Representatives 
has been an honor of a lifetime, very surreal. As someone said before, 
I think my colleague   Greg Stanton from Arizona, over 31 years ago, I 
left an abusive ex-husband, and I had a little daughter. There were 
times when I had no money. I remember there was a time when I had no 
place to live. I went to see if I could get into a shelter, and it was 
full. To go from that, just trying to survive, to serving here shows 
you that God is good, and America is good.
  Going from that, to flying on Air Force One; to sitting in my 
apartment in Washington, D.C., and getting a call from the President of 
the United States, President Trump, from staying overnight and being 
invited to Camp David--which not too many people get to do--and to be 
one of only eight U.S. Congress Members to be selected by President 
Trump to serve on his impeachment defense team. Wow, just absolutely 
unbelievable.
  In the 6 years and almost 8 months that I have been here, I have been 
part of history. I experienced so much history that has never happened 
before.
  I served on the Judiciary Committee during both impeachments, but it 
went through committee on the first impeachment of President Trump. I 
saw firsthand how I thought it was so corrupt and politically 
motivated, and it disgusted me. I was so upset. I really studied hard. 
I studied all of the so-called evidence, and it was just a dark time in 
the United States.
  I was there when Robert Mueller came to Judiciary Committee to 
testify, and we all prepared and it was kind of really a surprise of 
how he testified and wasn't able to answer certain questions.
  I was here in Congress and lived through COVID when Speaker Pelosi 
mandated that we wear masks in all of the committees and on the floor; 
when Speaker Pelosi put metal detectors right outside of those doors 
and every single Member of Congress had to go through metal detectors 
as if we were some type of threat.
  I was here when Speaker Pelosi instituted proxy voting on the floor. 
It never been done before in the history of the United States; not 
through different diseases, not through wars, but we did it here. I 
joined in the lawsuit against it, thinking it was unconstitutional.

                              {time}  1900

  I was here on January 6. That was just a crazy day.

[[Page H6408]]

  I have had one heck of a ride, one heck of a ride here, and I have 
met so many great people. Truly, I believe that the vast majority of 
Congress Members are good people, good people who want to make a 
difference in our lives.
  I have been able to help hundreds of constituents, and that is such a 
great feeling because they have come up to me, and some of these 
constituents have come up to me crying, saying: Debbie, you were able 
to help me. I was at my wit's end. I couldn't get my Social Security 
payment. I couldn't get my veteran benefit payment. Your office helped 
me.
  That is really satisfying to me.
  I was able to pass legislation. Not only was I a cosponsor of the big 
border bill securing the border and other great bills, but there were 
my own bills, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act and the Hands Off Our Home 
Appliances Act, which were passed out of this House.
  I was able to serve on the prestigious Energy and Commerce Committee, 
the select subcommittee on COVID-19, the Judiciary Committee, the Rules 
Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee. What an honor it has been.
  I also served on the whip team and on the steering committee where we 
would select which Republicans served on which committees and which 
Republicans served as chairman or ranking member on the committees.
  I have made a lot of great friends, some of them are here today, and 
I will never forget you.
  Now, it is time for me to move on. I have a great family at home. My 
mother is 95. My loving husband is home. I have three kids. I have six 
grandkids. I have a brother and a sister who all live within 20 minutes 
of my house. I am here in Washington, D.C., 60, 70 percent of the time. 
There is something wrong with that picture.
  As I leave, it is kind of bittersweet, but I am happy. I am happy I 
am going home, and I am happy I have had this experience of my 
lifetime. I will never regret it.
  I thank my constituents who have always put their trust in me, the 
voters in my district; President Trump, who has supported me; my staff 
that has worked in my congressional office either now or in the past 
and the staff here at the Capitol. You have been great people, and I 
won't forget it.
  Thank you, and God bless all of you as God has blessed me.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

          DISCUSSION ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Roy) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I didn't get 
a chance to get down here in time during the time that was set aside to 
honor her service, but I am glad I was down here and was able to get 
down at the tail end of it to hear her speech.
  It has been an honor. We were classmates. We came in together, served 
together.
  I remember when the gentlewoman told us that she wasn't running 
again. I found her on the floor, and I said: So, what is going on? Why 
aren't you staying with us? And she said one word, family. That is the 
right answer.
  You have been a great patriot. Congress is far better for having had 
you in it, and we will miss you. We know you won't be too far away, and 
we hope to see you here.
  God bless you. Spend time with your family. I feel the pain of being 
away as you do. I will be very happy for you, but I will give you a few 
floor speeches to watch every once in a while here just for fun.
  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight because there is a lot of 
talk going on right now about what has been referred to as DOGE, this 
effort by our friends Elon and Vivek with respect to the Department of 
Government Efficiency.
  I am not 100 percent clear yet what that looks like in terms of 
formality, how the incoming President, President Trump, plans to 
establish it and set it up.
  We had some great meetings today with those two men and Members of 
Congress who are interested in facilitating their work.
  My only problem with the named Department of Government Efficiency is 
I would refer to it as the department of government elimination. I 
think we would be a lot better off if we were eliminating large swaths 
of that which has been unconstitutionally created to rack up $36 
trillion in debt.
  I think what merits observation is what this body needs to do to 
actually deliver on what people are, I think, to some degree across the 
country, getting excited about with respect to the prospect of the 
brain power that has been assembled around this department, DOGE, or 
this effort. Congress has to actually do our part.
  We had a meeting today. There was a lot of conversation back and 
forth, and there were a whole lot of Members of Congress who were 
looking to them to say to please do this. One Member said to please 
help give us the fortitude, the spine, to be able to deliver on 
removing and cutting this waste in government.
  Look, to be very clear, the use of technology, crowdsourcing, AI by 
these guys and other smart people around the country, the use of 
technology, observe it, figure out what to do with it, great. I am for 
it.
  I support their efforts. I support efforts by the incoming President 
and his staff, his administration, to, frankly, massively slash and 
burn the bureaucracy that is sucking away, frankly, the life of the 
American people through overregulation, overspending, and driving up 
inflation because we keep spending more and more money in this vast 
bureaucracy. You can't even keep up with it.
  I have a bill that I introduced a few years ago, the Count the Crimes 
to Cut Act. Do you know why? Nobody can tell me how many crimes there 
are. Literally, nobody can tell me how many crimes there are in the 
Federal Government. Does anybody see that as a problem? We literally 
don't even know how many--forget cataloging them all, organizing them 
all, figuring out how much of them are repeated or overburdensome or 
perhaps out of line. We don't even know, and I can't even get that bill 
through the committee and down to the floor. Members of this body don't 
want to know how many crimes there are so we can maybe go observe and 
try to do something about it?
  On this score is where I believe Elon and Vivek can add massive 
value. They don't necessarily need us to pass something to go count the 
crimes. They can just use technology, AI, crowdsourcing, work and put a 
whole lot of effort into doing that because, frankly, a lot of people 
don't understand this, but we are pretty short-staffed here as it 
relates to our offices on Capitol Hill dealing with constituents 
services, dealing with the stuff we deal with all the time. Having an 
army of people and being able to leverage that is going to be really 
important.
  Now, let's cut to the chase. The fact of the matter is, too many 
Members of the United States Congress are all too excited to hide 
behind Elon and Vivek to do the work they are supposed to do. That is 
the truth. I saw colleagues going to the mike thanking them saying, oh, 
please save us from the scourge of bureaucracy.
  Well, what the hell is our job? We actually do have separation of 
powers. We actually are Article I. We actually do have the ability to 
use the power of the purse to constrain the leviathan and the executive 
branch. We just never do it ever.
  If we dare try, oh, the scorn, oh, the look from your colleagues when 
you dare come down and object to a consent request, as I did, for $19 
billion. That seems trivial now, doesn't it? I objected to a consent 
request for $19 billion in 2019 for Hurricane Harvey relief 
predominantly heavily in my home State of Texas.
  A unanimous consent request was being offered on the floor. I was at 
the airport. I got word that they were going to do this by consent. I 
thought, wait a minute, they are going to pass $19 billion by unanimous 
consent on the floor of the House, and we are not there, and it is not 
paid for.
  Well, it might be meritorious in some respects. I don't know, but I 
would have to look at the funding and what it is going to be used for 
in Texas. There are people hurting in Texas, but we have to pay for it. 
We certainly don't pass things for $19 billion by consent.

[[Page H6409]]

  Mr. Speaker, I got in my car, canceled the flight, got in a car, an 
Uber, came back here to the Hill, and ran down on the floor, and I 
objected.
  Do you know what happened back in Texas? The usual suspects, the 
newspapers, the editorial boards, the people who like to have wailing 
and gnashing of teeth, and the wine-sipping crowds of the elites in the 
cities in Austin, they are all like: Oh, you are the devil. This is 
horrible. How could you do this?

  A funny thing happened, and this is my message to my colleagues, my 
constituents, even though, again, my district wasn't as directly 
impacted by Harvey, fair, but my constituents and other people around 
the State of Texas took notice that maybe if a Member of Congress says 
there ought to be some principles that guide what we do and that there 
is a right way to do things, maybe our country would be better off. 
Maybe we wouldn't have $36 trillion of debt.
  I would mention right now, in that very same context, we are 
currently considering a disaster supplemental bill again. Every year, 
we consider some sort of disaster supplemental bill. Why is that? That 
is because the world has events. They have always had events. Galveston 
was hit at the turn of the last century. It was wiped out. There have 
been floods. There have been fires. There have been constant issues, 
tornadoes. This isn't all related to climate change. It is over the 
course of the history of mankind. In fact, our use of technology makes 
us able to manage those better, our use of energy. We can manage that 
better by abundant, reliable energy.
  What happens is every year there is something that strikes at our 
heart. There was Katrina in 2005, Ike, Harvey, what happened in Hawaii. 
Go down the list of things that we care about. We are in a massive 
drought in Texas, a massive drought.
  We have all sorts of different things that pop up. So here we are, 
and we have $113 billion that has been put forward from the 
administration under the name of disaster relief.
  There are all manners of things in that bill, and we are looking at 
those things: replenish the disaster relief fund, what we call the DRF, 
$40 billion; $16 billion for some stuff on defense; another pot of 
money for farmers who have had issues across the country related to 
disaster and otherwise; and go down the list to the tune of $111 
billion or $113 billion.
  It is not paid for. It is just another check-writing exercise, but it 
is the writing of a check by printing of money because that is what we 
do. There is no limiting principle.
  My question for anybody watching this is: What do you think the 
limiting principle ought to be for the elected Representatives you send 
here to represent you? Is it, well, man, that is a really sympathetic 
thing; write the check. Is that our limiting principle? ``Chip, there 
are people hurting in North Carolina.'' Yes, I know. I pray for them. 
We try to support organizations like Samaritan's Purse and others that 
help.

                              {time}  1915

  I have had colleagues like Cory Mills who went in early trying to 
deal with disaster relief. The last time I checked, the State of North 
Carolina is not a Third World country that has no resources or 
abilities. They have a very robust economy and a very strong State.
  Are they unable to issue bonds?
  Are they unable to find ways to come up with their own dollars to 
build their own infrastructure and rebuild?
  The State of Texas when we have a calamity--the State of Texas is 
literally the eighth biggest economy in the world. Just Texas is the 
eighth largest economy in the world. Other than immediate disaster 
relief using the resources of the National Guard or the resources at 
FEMA where you have an actual emergency, where you have got to move 
people and help them deal with being in floods, we all help each other 
out. Send the resources, yes, Governors, go help.
  However, we are now 1 month later, 2 months later.
  Why is the State of Texas not able to deal with a disaster?
  Are we unable to deal with it?
  We have, I think, almost a $400 billion biennial budget, i.e., 
roughly a $200 billion a year budget in Texas.
  So is Texas, the eighth largest economy, are we not able to deal with 
disasters?
  I think we can. I think most States in this country can. I think most 
of us can do what we need to do.
  The Federal Government doesn't need to be an ATM, but that is what we 
are turning it into.
  If there isn't a limiting principle on printing money, then how can 
DOGE be successful?
  Someone explain to me how all the efforts by Elon, all of the efforts 
by Vivek, and all of the efforts of the incoming Office of Management 
and Budget and President Trump, if this body, if this Congress, if this 
Republican majority does nothing but do the same old thing we have 
always done, which is come down here and write checks that have no 
backing, we are literally the Fed just printing money, then how can we 
possibly limit the size, the scope, and the growth of the Federal 
Government?
  In other words, Mr. Speaker, look in the mirror. Don't look for a 
fiscal savior. Don't look for salvation for the future of the country's 
well-being with some folks over in the executive branch or who are 
friends with the executive branch who are going to provide us great 
information. Be grateful for it, but remember when we go through the 
appropriations process, it is our job. They can make the executive 
branch more efficient, yes, but we are the ones who create these 
departments and create these programs. We are supposed to authorize 
them, but we don't.
  The Homeland Security Department was created over 20 years ago. We 
have never reauthorized it. It is insane. There are 200 and something 
thousand employees at the Department of Homeland Security. We have 
never reauthorized it. That is our job, but all we do is sit around and 
shrug our shoulders and say: Well, man, have you been to the mountains 
of Western North Carolina? It is just awful.
  We have to write that check.
  What if I say: Okay, fine. God bless these awesome Americans. They 
need assistance. Yeah, fine, you don't have to pay for it. Write the 
check.
  Then what?
  Do we write the next check?
  Do we just keep printing money for everybody's illness?
  Mr. Speaker, do you know that right now under FEMA we are using FEMA 
emergency dollars to pay for COVID-related burials?
  Why? Why?
  It is because somebody declared an energy at some point, the 
administration was given large pots of money, and now everybody just 
shrugs and walks away.
  The fact of the matter is the President, President Trump, was elected 
in, in today's time, what you could describe as a landslide. In today's 
divided world with what we call the trifecta, Republicans will control 
the House, and Republicans will control the Senate. They are pretty 
thin majorities in both Chambers.
  The question that will be for Republicans is: What are we going to 
do? Will we deliver?
  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to you that we are not going to truly 
deliver unless at least two things are true, and I think there are 
three, four, or five, but at least two things are true.
  One, we fully secure the border and undo the damage caused by the 
open borders of the last 4-plus years; and two, we stop spending money 
we don't have. If we can't do those two things, then we won't have a 
country left.
  Mr. Speaker, I am not sitting here telling you that I think we can 
balance the $2 trillion deficit in 1 year. I think that would be 
difficult to continue to have economic growth and do what we need to 
do. However, I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, that we need to actually be 
serious because I would say to my fellow Republicans, I have said that 
we need to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which is subsidizing 
Chinese wind and solar. It is now putting American companies on the 
hook, and they are wanting to get the big drug high of getting more 
money and more subsidies.
  We are now turning ourselves away from what is the strength of the 
reliable American oil and gas industry. We are driving up the cost of 
goods and driving up inflation all under the Inflation Reduction Act.

[[Page H6410]]

  My view is, and the view of most Americans, and I promise you, 
virtually everybody in this Chamber--not all--we ran on repealing the 
so-called Inflation Reduction Act, ending those subsidies, returning to 
market forces determining the best reliable energy and, importantly, 
stop spending money we don't have for the subsidies to enrich the 
Chinese and enrich our enemies who undermine our own well-being.
  A handful of my colleagues signed a letter saying that they don't 
want to do that.
  Let me just posit: What if I am successful?
  What if we are successful and we repeal it?
  What have we done?
  We have returned to the status quo of 2022.
  Basically, on that issue I am begging to return to the halcyon days 
of old in 2022 when everything was great, deficits were great, and 
everything was wonderful.
  I am being sarcastic.
  So if I am successful, I fight, and I struggle for all the people who 
don't want to tell their big corporations ``no,'' who are now hooked on 
the subsidies, because that is what is going to happen, including 
Texas, I am looking at you, Texas, all your big oil and gas companies 
are getting on the hook because they like free money. It ain't free, by 
the way. They like subsidies they can turn into current-day profits at 
the expense of your children's future. It is because they don't care 
because they will get a good earnings report, and they will make money 
now.
  However, the debt will keep going up and the dollar will keep getting 
weakened and inflation will keep being real.
  So if we can do it, if we can repeal it, if we are successful, then 
all we will do is rewind the clock to 2022. If we return to pre-COVID 
spending, Mr. Speaker, all you do is return the clock to 2020. That 
would basically save us $200 billion a year.
  Repealing the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and ending those 
subsidies would save us, oh, probably about $70 billion a year over 10 
years.
  What if we secure the border tomorrow?
  Now, mind you, Mr. Speaker, securing the border even under President 
Trump meant we had 30,000 or so a month still coming across the border. 
Let's just say we secure the border.
  Now what are we doing with the, what, 10 million people or so who are 
now in our country that weren't?
  Okay, let's repatriate them.
  How many will we repatriate?
  We would have to repatriate them all just to return to the status 
quo.
  Mr. Speaker, my point of all this is: If you want to transform the 
country, then we need transformative policies, and you need a Congress 
willing to do it. You need a Congress willing to actually deliver on 
what they said they would do.
  This is a refrain I have offered in a number of speeches here on the 
floor of the House. They are not always that well received. I gave a 
speech saying: Name one thing. Some of my colleagues got a little mad, 
as I said, the best way to do that is to do the thing, deliver.
  However, we are $36 trillion in debt. If we do everything I just 
said, if we renew the Trump tax cuts from 2017 and we extend them so 
that everybody's taxes--again, I am going back to my point, go to the 
status quo. If we do all of those things, then we will be struggling 
just to get to deficit neutrality on the issue, meaning we will still 
be at $2 trillion of debt a year.
  Now, if Elon, Vivek and company can find a bunch of waste and we can 
cut that out and then we can use that to either bring back savings or 
maybe cut down on drugs or take that money and use it for additional 
things that would be better, say, the Pentagon. Okay, that is great, 
maybe we will save a little bit.
  However, if you save 30 percent of our discretionary budget, let's 
say they go and they hack out just mountains of waste, fire 
bureaucrats, and one-third, 33 percent, of the discretionary budget 
just goes away, poof, that is about $600 billion. We are running about 
a $2 trillion deficit. I am just trying to put this in perspective.
  I am for that.
  Do you know why I am for it, Mr. Speaker?
  Fire the bureaucrats, end the weaponization, end the waste, and end 
the people who are targeting us. Make them have to go out and get a 
real job. I am for all of those things, and our country would be better 
off. If we do it, then we will earn the right to deal with mandatory 
spending.
  I said to some of my colleagues today in a meeting when Vivek and 
Elon were here, and I pointed out that we have a $113 billion bill on 
the floor for the disaster supplemental. I am pointing out that it is 
not going to be paid for. I am pointing out it is going to continue to 
perpetuate waste. I am talking about a bike path in Alaska, COVID 
spending across the country, and I think a church parking lot in 
Vermont. I mean, I could go down a laundry list of things that the 
current FEMA emergency funding is being used for, Mr. Speaker. Then we 
are going to just throw another $40 billion at it after we have been 
criticizing FEMA all through the fall about how incompetent they are 
and how bad they are.
  We will say: Do you know what your reward is?
  Here is more money, keep doing your bureaucratic thing. Don't worry, 
Elon and Vivek will save us. That is because we sure as hell aren't 
going to save us.
  That is what we do.
  My perspective is we should look in the mirror. We should do our job 
and constrain that spending. Don't give it to bureaucrats. Do our part. 
Find the savings and do what we can do to make it work.
  However, do you know what my colleagues said?
  My colleagues said: Well, Chip, the discretionary spending doesn't 
matter because of the point I said a minute ago. If you cut one-third 
of it, then you save $600 billion, and you still have a $2 trillion 
deficit.
  Why?
  It is because we have made promises for at least one-half a century 
on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid and increasingly on 
veterans' benefits that we can't keep up with. Then Republicans go 
around pounding their chest on tax policy: We will cut taxes so we will 
create economic growth. We will bring in revenue, and we will ignore 
the deficits.
  I am for the tax cuts, but if you are not doing the spending cuts, 
then you end up with $36 trillion in debt.
  Republicans need to look in the mirror. If my colleagues think we are 
going to just waltz in to a reconciliation debate in January and it is 
all going to be kumbaya because K Street wants tax cuts and 
because certain people think that they are going to get their bread 
buttered, but we are not going to focus on deficits, then I would just 
suggest that maybe they think long and hard about the calendar that the 
House put out whereby we are only here 3 days a week, 3 weeks a month, 
and maybe we should follow the Senate calendar, which to his great 
credit the incoming leader put out, 5 days a week every week for the 
first 3 months of the year.

  We were elected to do something different, and by goodness, we are 
going to do something different. We must. We have no choice. Failure is 
not an option.
  I will make just one other point in closing here as we deal with all 
of that on the spending issue. I watched the Senate Republicans doing 
this dance of hand-wringing and concern about the President's nominees.
  The President was elected by the American people to change this town. 
He has nominated people who want to change this town. Mr. Speaker, if 
you want to go turn over every rock of everybody's past and then say 
that they are not capable or they don't deserve to serve in a position 
like Secretary of Defense as is currently occurring with the targeted 
attacks on Pete Hegseth, then maybe you should take the board out of 
your eye.
  I am not saying that we don't have standards that are appropriate in 
the advise-and-consent process. We do, and we should. I am a believer 
in that separation of powers. However, the President also is deserving 
of the courtesy and the respect of his own party, in particular, of the 
individuals he is nominating to change the town.
  He was elected to change it.
  You don't like Tulsi because she is a Democrat?
  Get over it. She is not anymore. She is a Republican now, but she 
was. In this Chamber, I served with her, she was a Democrat.

[[Page H6411]]

  You don't like Bobby Kennedy because he is from an iconic Democrat 
family?
  Get over it. I don't agree with Bobby Kennedy on a lot of different 
things, but I agree with him that we need to fundamentally change our 
healthcare system and that we need to make America healthy again.
  I agree with Tulsi that we have been involved in endless wars and 
endless conflict that is draining our resources and undermining our men 
and women in uniform.

                              {time}  1930

  I agree with Pete Hegseth that wokeism is destroying the United 
States military. I agree with Pete that we don't need to have endless 
wars. I agree with Pete that we ought to have somebody who has served 
in battle and understands it who is at the top of the Pentagon, rather 
than the brass, who, frankly, often like the ribbons more than actually 
doing the work that is necessary to defend this country.
  I like the fact that we have people who the President is nominating 
who will take on the establishment and take on, for example, the FBI 
with Kash Patel.
  The fact of the matter is we have Senators who are wanting to 
challenge it. For example, the Senator from Iowa who is going after 
Pete Hegseth, or seemingly, being critical. This is the same Senator, 
by the way, who voted for an NDAA that would draft our daughters and 
has been fighting to draft our daughters.
  I tell her: You will do that over my dead body. There will be no 
draft of my daughter.
  She voted for The Respect for Marriage Act to codify gay marriage. 
She went out to her constituents and talked about how the horrible 
Senate border bill was somehow a good bill and then scolded President 
Trump for opposing it. She voted for Garland for Attorney General, 
voted for Lloyd Austin for Defense, voted for Buttigieg for DOT, voted 
for Janet Yellen, voted for Ukraine's borders over America's borders.
  With all due respect to the Senator from Iowa, she is not where the 
American people are. President Trump is, and Pete Hegseth is.
  We have an obligation to change this town, or we are going to lose 
this country. If Republicans do not deliver and if we do not do what we 
said we would do, this party will end. There will not be a Republican 
Party if we fail in this term, this Congress, to deliver.
  That is not hyperbole. It is true. We will go the way of the whigs. 
We will secure the border. We will return order to our streets. We will 
cut spending. We will move toward balancing our budgets.
  As the President has nominated, we will confirm people who will 
change this town and take on the bureaucracy. We will listen to and 
work with Elon and Vivek, root out the waste and fraud, but do it 
ourselves.
  We will pass bills that actually get the job done. We will undo the 
damage of the Biden administration, replace it with a legacy that our 
kids and grandkids can be proud of, root out the wokeism, root out all 
of the DEI and the critical race theory. Kill it. Kill it now.
  We will do these things, or we will not exist. We will organize 
ourselves as a Conference to do those things, or we won't succeed.
  Our job between now, the first week of December, and the first week 
of January is to get our heads in the right places. They currently 
aren't there.
  We are not structured right now to deliver, and we have 1 month to do 
it. That is my calling. We are not here to take breaks. We are not here 
for codels. We are not here for trips. We are here to get the job done.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

  Let us pray.
  Author of Life, who put into our hearts such deep desires that we

                         Tribute to Scott Raab

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, every year, scores of bright young 
people arrive on Capitol Hill to begin careers of public service. On 
the whole, they tend to be bright, ambitious, principled, and 
patriotic. I have been fortunate to have the best of them on my team.
  But I am certain no one has ever shown up on day one better prepared 
to advocate for a State he is not from than my deputy chief of staff of 
policy, Scott Raab.
  From the moment he walked in the door in 1999, Scott knew as much 
about my legislative record and about Kentucky's priorities as anyone 
on the team. Before long, he was fluent in the Commonwealth's smallest 
towns and counties. Somewhere along the way, he turned into a rabid fan 
of Kentucky basketball. And for years, new arrivals to my staff in the 
Republican leader office have consistently mistaken this honorary son 
of the Bluegrass for a native one.
  I say all this to make it clear the kind of person we are dealing 
with. This is the sort of friend and adviser that simply doesn't grow 
on trees: the natural whiz who still studies relentlessly; the wonk 
whose expertise runs both deep and wide; the man for whom loyalty is 
not a transactional currency but a way of life; and, of course, the 
champion of ``Blue Shirt Thursday'' and the only member of my staff who 
can pull off the bow tie.
  This exceedingly rare breed--this is Scott Raab. As my policy 
director, there is no topic that falls outside his portfolio. And there 
is no problem that isn't, in some way, his to solve.
  This is hardly a recent development, and it is certainly not by 
accident. After just a few years on my personal office staff, through 
steady and unassuming competence, Scott became a clearinghouse for 
input on important decisions. Our entire team leaned on his 
encyclopedic knowledge, his good judgment, and, of course, his upset 
picks for March Madness brackets.
  For much of Scott's tenure, his colleagues turned to him as a 
resident expert on healthcare policy. He had to protect my blind side 
on a set of issues I confess have always confounded me. But when you 
are as good as Scott is at boiling complex problems down to their 
essence, you wind up pulling extra duty. It didn't matter if an issue

[[Page S6826]]

wasn't in his portfolio. If it was really hard and really important, 
it, of course, would wind up on Scott's desk.
  Eventually, as is often the case with the greatest flying aces, it 
fell to Scott to lead the whole squadron, to marshal the strengths and 
expertise of my entire team, and to deploy them in pursuit of an 
outcome. There have been very few outcomes Scott has pursued and not 
achieved. And that is because he is one of the very few people in 
Washington who, by their very involvement in an issue, signal that 
things are probably going to somehow work out.
  I am speaking, of course, about Scott's daily arrival to light and 
tend the fireplace in my chief of staff's office. In meetings anywhere 
in the Capitol, Scott speaks with my authority but a command of policy 
nuance and procedural nuance entirely his own.
  Without uttering a word, Scott's patrols along the back wall of this 
Chamber are a sign to our colleagues things are under control--or at 
least they will be very soon.
  Scott, of course, is too modest to acknowledge this. He is too self-
effacing to admit the number of times where the price of rescuing must-
pass legislation or keeping the Federal Government's lights on has been 
his nights, his weekends, and his all-hours attention.
  For a husband and father with a young family, it is difficult to 
quantify this sacrifice. It is impossible to overstate how the road to 
high-stakes government funding agreements has so often been paved with 
missed swim meets and soccer games and with goodnight calls and bedtime 
stories over FaceTime illustrated with a Cookie Monster hand puppet.
  So I am grateful to Scott's dear wife Katherine for her patience and 
to Molly and Lauren for sharing their dad with us so often.
  There is simply no way to make sense of the quarter century of 
honorable service Scott has rendered without talking about a certain 
intangible devotion. You don't stick around that long for the pay. You 
certainly don't do it for the flexible hours. But if your name is Scott 
Raab, you might just do it because you love the Senate and believe in 
the people you work with.
  As it so happens, Scott's colleagues over the years have believed in 
him too. They say that ``his input was essential''; that he would be 
``the person in my will to take care of my kids''; that he ``does the 
right thing the right way''; and that they are ``proud to call him 
[their] friend.''
  Well, I am as well.
  I am going to miss staring down the toughest fights with Scott Raab 
at my side. But if anyone is entitled to cut the net down and walk out 
of here satisfied they left it all on the court, it is Scott.
  So Scott, thanks for everything.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.

                     FBI Background Investigations

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I served on the Senate Judiciary Committee 
for over 20 years, including the last 4 as chairman.
  During that time, I voted on thousands of judicial U.S. attorneys, 
U.S. marshals, and Justice Department nominees.
  Every nominee who has gone through our committee--everyone--shares 
one thing in common, whether nominated by a Democrat or a Republican 
President, every single nominee has undergone an FBI background 
investigation--everyone.
  President-elect Trump has the right to nominate his preferred 
candidates for Justice Department and judicial vacancies, but the 
Judiciary Committee plays a critical role in offering advice and 
consent on nominations, which includes receiving and reviewing the 
results of FBI background investigations.
  After weeks of reports that President-elect Trump planned to bypass 
the FBI entirely, it was a relief to hear that the Trump transition 
team had finally signed an agreement this week to allow the FBI to 
conduct background investigations.
  But I remain concerned about whether President-elect Trump will 
require all his appointees to undergo the process. Listen to what the 
New York Times reported:

       Despite the signing of the agreement, it remains unclear 
     whether [the] Trump's team plans to send the names of all 
     officials requiring a security clearance or Senate 
     confirmation to the F.B.I. for vetting.

  If President-elect Trump's nominees are not required to submit to the 
same FBI vetting procedure as previous nominees, it makes you wonder 
what they are hiding.
  The practice of the FBI conducting background investigations is not a 
new idea. The nominations investigations of the President's nominees 
dates back 70 years to the Eisenhower administration, and it applies to 
every Senate-confirmed position, including more than 1,200 positions in 
the executive branch, 900 Federal judicial nominees, 93 U.S. attorney 
nominees, and 94 U.S. marshal nominees. Every single one is subject to 
an FBI investigation.
  You might ask yourself, Why is it so important to vet all these 
nominees? Consider the views of Noah Bookbinder and Gregg Nunziata, 
former Democratic and Republican counsels on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, who, on a bipartisan basis, reviewed hundreds of nominees' 
background investigations.
  They wrote in the New York Times:

       Without nominees being scrutinized by the F.B.I., the 
     danger is that neither lawmakers nor the public would know 
     whether they are trustworthy or have issues that compromise 
     their ability to do the job or [even] their loyalty to the 
     United States.

  As Mr. Bookbinder and Nunziata noted in their op-ed:

       A nomination was never scheduled for committee 
     consideration without the committee receiving an F.B.I. 
     background check, reviewing it and clearing the nomination to 
     move forward.

  By design, positions that require Senate confirmation are of great 
importance. These individuals make critical decisions that protect 
America, our national security, and affect many thousands of American 
lives, including who is investigated, who is charged with a crime, and 
how the justice system operates.
  It is absolutely critical that people nominated to these positions 
are upstanding citizens who can be trusted with sensitive life-or-death 
government information, people who will be immune to blackmail or 
foreign influence and are truly loyal to the United States.
  President-elect Trump has reportedly considered using a private 
investigative firm to conduct these background investigations. That is 
unacceptable for one basic reason. First, when the nominees submit 
their paperwork to the FBI as a part of their background 
investigations, they are on notice that lying or concealing material 
facts is a felony--a felony. The same goes for individuals who agree to 
speak with the FBI about nominees' character and fitness. In 
comparison, there would be no penalties for misleading a private 
investigative firm.
  Second, the FBI's resources in determining if a nominee poses a risk 
far outweigh any private firm's capabilities. Seasoned agents at the 
FBI field offices nationwide are deployed to pull records, interview 
individuals, and report their findings.
  Finally, any private firm paid by the Trump transition team would 
have an unavoidable conflict of interest. They would have an incentive 
to clear the backgrounds of nominees so they would get more business 
from the transition team. By contrast, the only motive for FBI agents 
is honoring their oath to the Constitution.
  It is the duty of President-elect Trump to pick nominees of his 
choosing. It is also the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, to 
carefully examine the record of each nominee before this body. To 
fulfill this constitutional duty of advice and consent on nominations, 
the Judiciary Committee must continue to receive background 
investigations conducted by the FBI for every single nominee.
  We owe the American people a transparent transition of power, but 
that is only possible if the incoming administration follows 
longstanding, established practices ensuring that the President's 
nominees can be trusted in a position of power.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior executive assistant clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                         Tribute to Mitt Romney

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one of the drawbacks of the end of a 
Congress is the need to say goodbye to departing colleagues. We are 
losing two Republicans this year--Senators Mitt Romney and Mike Braun.
  Mitt gave his farewell remarks yesterday, and they were 
characteristic of the man I have come to know: humble, faith-filled, 
patriotic. Mitt is what I would call a character guy. He is guided by a 
moral compass, and he is not afraid to live by it. And in a world where 
being religious isn't always highly regarded, he is unapologetic about 
his faith.
  Mitt is also a big family guy. Like me, he married up, and he and his 
wife Ann have shared the good times and the tough times for well now 
over 50 years of marriage--hard to believe to look at him. But they say 
children keep you young, and Mitt has 5 sons and an incredible 25 
grandchildren--a beautiful legacy all on its own.
  Mitt's professional legacy needs no recounting. He is well known as a 
successful businessman, a successful Republican Governor of a deep-blue 
State, and most recently as a successful Senator. He may be leaving us 
after just one term, but that term was filled with an outsized amount 
of work, and he has more than earned his retirement.








[Page S6827]
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]



                              Nominations

  Mr. President, a few days ago I sent Senator Thune a letter asking 
that we go through the regular advice and consent process. That meant 
full FBI investigations of every nominee, the Senate be able to look at 
those, hearings with questions in the Senate on every nominee, and then 
votes on the floor.
  I am glad to see that at least the President-elect's administration 
is beginning to look at the FBI investigation issue, and that is a 
small step in the right direction. But we must have them for all 
nominees, they must be full FBI investigations, and they must be 
available for Senators to look at. And, of course, the necessity of 
hearings for each nominee, the necessity of votes on each nominee are 
just consonant with the advice and consent process that we have done in 
America for decades and decades and decades under Democratic and 
Republican Presidents and the like.
  I hope there will be no deviation from that grand and useful 
tradition.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

ordered.

                         Tribute to Mitt Romney

  Mr. President, finally, I wish to pay tribute and say thank you to a 
colleague from across the aisle, Senator Mitt Romney, who delivered his 
farewell address yesterday. I enjoyed meeting Senator Romney's family, 
his sons and his wife, at his reception the other night and told him 
how much I respected him and how much we will miss him in the Senate.
  On most issues, Senator Romney and I may have seemed like oil and 
water. But I have always appreciated him for his decency, his 
commitment to our country, and his willingness to work in good faith in 
a bipartisan way when the chance presented itself. And over the last 4 
years, we found numerous ways to do just that.
  Senator Romney was a good partner with me on COVID relief 
legislation, despite much opposition from the other side. And he helped 
build consensus on the infrastructure bill. He also remains a fierce 
defender of the Ukrainian people.
  Finally, I will always appreciate that Senator Romney joined me, 
alongside Senators Rosen, Kelly, and Cassidy, on our mission to Israel 
in the aftermath of October 7. So thank you, Senator Romney, and I wish 
you and your family the best in a new chapter in your life.

                       Tribute to George S. Helmy

  Mr. President, now, on Senator Helmy, today we say thank you and 
farewell to another member of our caucus, the junior Senator from New 
Jersey, Senator George Helmy. Senator Helmy will resign this weekend to 
make way for our new colleague, Senator-elect   Andy Kim, who we are 
all very excited to get to work with.
  In a very short amount of time, Senator Helmy put his name on over 30 
pieces of legislation, advocated for children's mental health, stood up 
for the well-being of the people of New Jersey, across America, and 
around the world. I would also be remiss if I didn't point out that 
Senator Helmy never hesitated to preside during pro forma sessions, a 
thankless but necessary job.
  Senator Helmy's service will also be remembered for its historical 
significance. He was the first Senator from the Coptic Church. Senator 
Helmy's faith had an immediate and direct impact here in the Senate 
when he invited His Grace Bishop David of the Diocese of New York and 
New England to the Senate a few weeks ago to deliver the first ever 
Senate opening prayer by a member of the Coptic Orthodox Church.
  So Senator Helmy, congratulations on a job well-done. You made New 
Jersey proud. We wish you and your family the best.

                          Judicial Nominations

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, today the Senate will continue 
doing what we have been doing all week, working to confirm as many of 
President Biden's well-qualified judicial nominees as possible.
  Yesterday, we confirmed two more district court judges for the 
Northern District of New York--Anthony Brindisi, a proud son of Utica 
whom I worked with closely when he was a member of Congress, and Beth 
Coombe, a trailblazing prosecutor.
  Later this morning, we will vote to confirm Sarah Davenport to be 
district court judge for the District of New Mexico. Following that, we 
will vote to advance the nominations of two more judges: Tiffany 
Johnson to be the district court judge for the Northern District of 
Georgia and Keli Neary to be district court judge for the Middle 
District of Pennsylvania.
  So of the five judges I filed cloture on Monday, we will have 
confirmed three by the end of today, and we will be very close to 
confirming the remaining two. While Democrats still hold the majority, 
we are going to do everything we can to confirm as many judges as we 
can.

                         Tribute to Mike Braun

  Mr. President, in addition to Mitt, Mike Braun is leaving us at the 
end of this Congress, in his case to go and serve as the Governor of 
Indiana. Mike is another guy who has had an outsized impact here in the 
Senate in a short amount time. In fact, he was named the most effect 
first-term Republican Senator in the 117th Congress--and no surprise.
  It was clear from the beginning that Mike came here because he wanted 
to get things done. Now he will bring that same drive and 
effectiveness--the drive and effectiveness that helped him grow a small 
business with 15 employees into a national company--to his work as 
Governor of Indiana. I have no doubt at all that the State will thrive 
under his leadership.
  As I may have told Mike, ``Hoosiers'' is one of my top five movies of 
all time, which has automatically made me a big fan of the Hoosier 
State. So I look forward to seeing all the great things that are going 
to happen to Indiana during his tenure. I know he will be incredibly 
busy as Governor, especially because Mike is a guy that gives his all 
to what he does--witness the fact that he has visited all 92 of 
Indiana's counties every year during his time here in the Senate.
  But I hope he will still find time for his beloved mushroom hunting, 
and I know he will be finding time to spend with his wife Maureen and 
their four children--three of whom work for the family business--as 
well as with their seven grandchildren.
  Mike, congratulations on your election as Governor. It has been a 
pleasure to work with you here in the Senate, and I look forward to 
seeing all the great things you will do in Indiana.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

                  Nomination of Sarah Morgan Davenport

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Sarah Davenport to the U.S. District Court for the District of New 
Mexico.
  Ms. Davenport's impressive career as a dedicated public servant for 
nearly two decades, combined with her Federal court experience, will 
make her an excellent addition to the Federal bench.
  After earning her bachelor of music from New Mexico State University 
and her J.D. from the University of New Mexico School of Law, Ms. 
Davenport began her legal career at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
District of New Mexico, where she has spent the entirety of her career.
  Ms. Davenport first served as a law clerk for the Organized Crime 
Drug Enforcement Task Force Unit. She then served as a special 
assistant U.S. attorney, where she prosecuted drug trafficking, 
immigration, and firearms offenses. In 2009, Ms. Davenport became an 
assistant U.S. attorney, primarily handling complex drug trafficking 
and money laundering investigations.
  Since 2022, she has served as a supervisory assistant U.S. attorney, 
where she oversees prosecutors in her office who handle immigration, 
firearms, drug trafficking, white collar, and violent crime offenses.
  Ms. Davenport has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr. 
Heinrich and Mr. Lujan. In addition, Ms. Davenport was rated 
unanimously ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association.
  I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Davenport's nomination.

             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar

  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Mark 
Eskenazi's and Amanda Wood Laihow's nominations to the Occupational 
Safety and Health Review Commission.
  I want to note for my colleagues that the Commission has not had a 
quorum since April of 2023 and, as a result, has been unable to decide 
cases for more than a year. Delays with the Commission's cases create 
significant risks to workers, and that is, in part, because, when an 
employer appeals a citation, they don't have to fix the alleged hazard 
until the Commission issues a final decision.
  Mr. Eskenazi is currently an Assistant General Counsel at the Office 
of the U.S. Trade Representative and previously has held numerous 
positions at the National Labor Relations Board.
  This is Ms. Wood Laihow's second nomination to the Occupational 
Safety and Health Review Commission. She was previously confirmed in 
January of 2020. Prior to her role on this Commission, she has served 
as the director of labor and employment policy for the National 
Association of Manufacturers and as deputy general counsel for the 
Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
  I support this bipartisan pair of nominees that will allow the 
Commission to have a quorum, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 374 and 785; that the 
Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or 
debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate's action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Wisconsin.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that my Republican 
colleague has blocked the confirmations of these nominees. These 
nominees have been held up since last year, and it is time to end these 
delays and confirm these nominees.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask that the scheduled vote occur 
immediately.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________

                         Farewell to the Senate

  Ms. BUTLER. Mr. President, I rise to join in the honored tradition of 
the Senate to offer my final floor remarks before departing.
  Interestingly, I rise to let the pages know that, breaking 
traditional Senate practice, there are no written remarks for you to 
come pick up. I decided just this morning that I was going to write a 
different speech, that I was going to offer words of my own as I mark 
what is the end of a journey for me.
  As I end this journey as the junior Senator representing 40 million 
Californians, it is a day that I want to thank them and thank Governor 
Newsom for giving me the honor and privilege of serving our great 
State.
  It has been a remarkable honor, a completely unimagined adventure to 
follow in the footsteps of Dianne Feinstein, who so ably served in this 
Chamber for more than 30 years, and to be blessed to walk the same 
hallways as Senator Carol Moseley Braun and share the same office space 
as Vice President Kamala Harris. It truly has been an unbelievable 
privilege.
  Indeed, the footsteps that I have had the opportunity to follow in 
this walk of service have been filled with decency, honor, integrity, 
and courage. I can only hope that for the people of California, I was 
able to do half as well as those who came before me.
  As is true for all of us and for those who came before, this journey 
of public service is not one that we travel alone. Along with us, on 
the rough side of the mountain, is our staff, the staff who work so 
hard to help keep the pace, who help to plot the path and bring all of 
the supplies and make sure that no one is lost or left behind.
  I want to thank my capable, incredibly talented staff for making sure 
that we never lost sight of our North Star, the people of California. 
They have given not only their hard work and long hours but their 
brilliant minds and all of their hearts to make sure that the last 14 
months have truly been impactful. For all of that, I will forever be 
grateful.
  I know that it is most often true that in the traversing of the roads 
of service, it is often our family and our friends who serve as the 
fuel that keeps us going day by day. That has been certainly true for 
me.
  My wife and daughter--Neneki and Nylah--have refilled my tank and 
refilled my cup at the moments that I thought that I was running low. 
So to them, I am grateful for never letting me run out.
  To my mother, who has watched more C-SPAN in the last 14 months than 
in all of her 71 years, my brothers, my sisters, aunts, uncles, 
cousins, and dear friends, just when the clouds get low and start to 
look a little heavy, it has been your cards, your texts, your letters, 
your visits to DC that truly have brought out the sunshine. So, to all 
of you, I am deeply grateful and cannot thank you enough.

  To my colleagues and fellow travelers, you have truly made this 
journey special. The old quote by Tim Cahill that says ``A journey is 
best measured in friends rather than miles'' is true for me. You have 
all given me so much to make this journey one to enjoy. It could not 
have been more true in my short time. I don't have the years or been 
able to plot the miles of any of my colleagues who have spoken up to 
this point as they prepare to leave, but I have had the opportunity to 
build what I believe will be lifelong friendships along this entire 
journey, and for that--on both sides of the aisle--I truly know that I 
am grateful.
  I want to give a special shout-out to my senior Senator Alex Padilla 
and his kind and generous comments from yesterday. He has been like a 
tour guide on this incredible ride, always carrying the compass, making 
sure I don't stray too far off the path but knowing full well that I am 
a traveler who is intent on walking her own way. Senator Padilla has 
supported me all along the journey, and I am grateful.
  I know that Senator-elect Schiff is here, and I appreciate him and 
his support throughout this transition and also a special call to 
Leader Chuck Schumer, who has given and, throughout these 14 months, 
offered his wisdom and his trust, his friendship. I am deeply, deeply 
grateful.
  Mr. President, what I know is that I stand on the floor of the Senate 
as a 14-month Senator, but my road to justice and the pursuit of 
justice has been much longer than 14 months. I know that I only stand 
here because of the men and women, the working families of SCIU and our 
labor movement, and I couldn't end this term without thanking them for 
sharing with me and inviting me into their stories of courage and hope 
for what is possible in our great country. I want them to know that I 
carry their stories with me and I carry their families with me, in my 
head and in my heart, here in the Senate and wherever it is that I go.
  Mr. President, in my final few minutes, I want to end my time in the 
Senate the way that I began it. On this floor, I gave my first speech 
talking with and about America's ``now generation'': our young leaders, 
future Members of Congress, carpenters, plumbers, firefighters, nurses, 
police officers. I talked with them about what I had heard from them, 
from so many of them, about what was important. So in my last remarks, 
I want to come back to them, talk with and about them, offer a few 
lessons from this experience here with all of you.
  All summer long, this ``now generation'' has been bopping to the 
masterful beats of California's own Kendrick Lamar. We all have been 
hearing from radio waves and all in our iPods the anthem that ``they 
not like us.'' As I celebrate what has become a global hit--I, too, 
have listened to it on repeat so often all throughout the summer--I 
want America's young leaders to know that the words of Kendrick are 
just that--words, lyrics in a historic rap battle, sources of great 
entertainment and joy. What they are not are words upon which we should 
build our communities or the future of our country because, indeed, 
``they'' are exactly ``like us.''
  You see, when I was 5, I went to Levi's Temple Head Start Center in 
Magnolia, MS. Of course, in Head Start, children get just that--a head 
start in learning the foundational lessons of preparing to be in a 
school environment. As I have been reflecting on this time and the 
lessons that this time has given me, I realized that in that old church 
building in Head Start, the experience there actually shaped who I have 
become. The seeds planted in Head Start are ones that have grown

[[Page S6830]]

in me every day for the 40 years since I left.
  It was 1985, and my Head Start teacher was a woman by the name of Ms. 
Carrie Hilbert. I remember getting ready to graduate Head Start and 
trying on these royal-blue graduation gowns and graduation caps. For 2 
weeks, Ms. Hilbert painstakingly prepared us for Head Start graduation. 
Our graduation song in 1985, she worked to make sure that we--little, 
squirmy 5- and 6-year-olds--were going to be able to sing this song and 
perform for our parents and our loved ones, and she did it masterfully.
  Mr. President, in 1985, the lyrics Ms. Hilbert taught me were the 
lyrics to ``We Are the World,'' written by the great Lionel Richie, 
Michael Jackson, and Quincy Jones, whom we lost just earlier this year. 
I remember having to practice that song day after day for probably 
about 2 weeks, not knowing then that all throughout that graduation 
rehearsal, seeds were being planted--seeds sang by Stevie Wonder and 
Lionel Richie:

       There comes a time when we must heed a certain call, when 
     the world must come together as one.

  Seeds. Seeds from Tina Turner and Billy Joel:

       We're all a part of God's great big family, and the truth, 
     you know love is all we need.

  Seeds sang and planted by the unlikely duo of Willie Nelson and Al 
Jarreau, who planted the seeds that ``as God has shown us by turning 
stone to bread, and so we all must lend a helping hand.''
  One of the most powerful seeds that really stuck with me were those 
offered by Michael Jackson, Huey Lewis, and Cyndi Lauper:

       When you're down and out and there seems no hope at all, 
     but if you just believe, there's no way we can fall. Let's 
     realize . . . that a change can only come when we stand 
     together as one.

  Young leaders, colleagues, Mr. President, I believe it was those 2 
weeks of repetition and practice that planted the seeds of possibility 
and hope, seeds of determination and courage. It was learning the 
lyrics to that song at 5 years old that inspired a generation full of 
patriots who believed in the power of this country to do good in the 
world and for each other, because when we choose to do hard things 
together--the people of this Nation, all of its elected leaders, our 
community advocates; when we see each other's humanity; when we see our 
neighbors as essential to the future we want for our children; when we 
understand that our differences are our greatest assets, it is then--
then--when we truly are doing and being the best country in the world.

  So my final prayer as a Member of this august body is that we realize 
that, as policymakers, we are generations' Head Start teachers. Every 
single day, we can plant seeds that will grow in the hearts and minds 
of young leaders, and we get to decide the seeds we plant. Will we 
plant seeds that help them understand and imagine what is possible for 
an America filled with people of different walks, different faiths, 
different bank accounts, different languages? Will we plant seeds to 
help them realize and see what is possible not just for the United 
States but for the world? And, as was taught to me in that old church 
building, we will reap what we sow.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
  (Applause, Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.

                     Tribute to Laphonza R. Butler

  Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I will wait for my colleague to receive her 
hugs of gratitude, and I have a few words I would like to say.
  Mr. President, I wanted to just take a moment to add my thanks and 
congratulations to our colleague Senator Laphonza Butler.
  You know, I look around this Chamber, and this is a Chamber that is 
filled with people who were once lawyers or Members of Congress, 
Governors or Lieutenant Governors--all incredibly fine and honorable 
professions--but there are not that many people in this room who came 
here because they were organizers. This is something that Senator 
Butler and I talked about when she first came to the Senate.
  Now, organizers are different because we understand that the power of 
accomplishing important things comes certainly from our leadership and 
the work that we do, but fundamentally it comes from the people we work 
with every single day, the folks that are out there on the ground, 
living the lives and doing the work. If you understand that your power 
to do good work comes from those people, then you approach everything, 
every problem, from a different perspective.
  I know this is where Senator Butler comes from as an organizer at 
SCIU and in her life, and I want to pay tribute to that because I think 
that kind of approach to problem-solving is something we can all learn 
from.
  I have watched you in the short time you have been in the Senate--
only 14 months, which, in the life of many Senators, is barely a blink 
of an eye--and I watched you figure out how to organize in this Chamber 
for the good of the people you represent.
  I noticed, Senator Butler, as you were preparing to give your opening 
remarks, that Senator Roger Wicker from Mississippi came up and gave 
you a big hug. This is our Senator who was born in Magnolia, MS. And I 
saw you start your building of a relationship with him on one of your 
very first days in the elevator when I was standing with you. That, I 
think, is a message and a lesson for all of us; that as you leave to go 
on to whatever you do next--and we can't wait to see what you do next--
we should all keep in mind the power of those relationships and 
building power to actually make a difference--make a difference in this 
world.
  The last thing I want to say, as we say farewell to you--only in this 
Chamber but not in our lives--is that your constant reminding us and 
using your platform to lift up the voices, as you say, of ``now 
leaders''--we have a tendency sometimes--those of us who are 50, 60, 
70, 80--to talk about the next generation of leaders and that ``Your 
time will come, and we will need you.''
  You always speak of our young leaders in the present tense because 
they are the leaders that we need now.
  So as I think about your service here in the Senate and the work that 
you have done, those are the two lessons that I will carry forward in 
my work in this Chamber. I offer this with much gratitude for your 
leadership both here in this Chamber, the work that you have done 
before, and the work I know you will continue to do. Thank you.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 3 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN'S STATE-SPONSORED PERSECUTION OF THE 
   BAHA'I MINORITY AND ITS CONTINUED VIOLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
                       COVENANTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged 
from further consideration and the Senate proceed to S. Res. 74.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A resolution (S. Res. 74) condemning the Government of 
     Iran's State-sponsored persecution of the Baha'i minority and 
     its continued violation of the International Covenants on 
     Human Rights.

  There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the 
Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for more than 40 years, this body has been 
passing resolutions condemning the Iranian Government's persecution of 
the Baha'is.
  This nightmare is not going away. In fact, the government of Iran has 
only intensified its ruthless agenda against the Baha'is.
  Over the last 16 months, attacks against women and violent home raids 
have increased, hate speech has spread, and scores of Baha'is remain 
behind bars on arbitrary, trumped up charges.
  Furthermore, Baha'is face ongoing employment and educational 
discrimination, as well as intrusive surveillance and invasive 
monitoring. The Baha'is are even denied the right to bury their dead, 
and when they do, their cemeteries are often vandalized or destroyed. 
Men, women, and children

[[Page S6831]]

bear the brunt of the Iranian Government's fear mongering day in and 
day out, with no end in sight.
  It is crucial for the Senate to pass my resolution today and strongly 
condemn the repressive Iranian Government. The Iranian Government's 
long history of harassing, dehumanizing, and persecuting the Baha'i 
community in all forms is only getting longer and worse.
  The Wyden family knows firsthand about authoritarian regimes 
targeting and persecuting individuals on the basis of religion. This 
issue is personal to me.
  I have been promised for years that this resolution would receive 
consideration through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but the 
committee hasn't taken up this important issue.
  My resolution, which has strong bipartisan support, condemns the 
government of Iran's state-sanctioned persecution of the Baha'i 
community and its continued violation of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Covenant of Civil and Political 
Rights.
  My resolution further calls on the Iranian Government to release all 
people detained or imprisoned solely on account of their religion, end 
their campaign of hate against the Baha'is, and reverse policies that 
deny Baha'is and other religious minorities equal opportunities, 
freedoms, and rights under law.
  My resolution also calls on the Biden administration to condemn these 
human rights violations, push for the release of religious prisoners, 
and use its authorities to impose sanctions against those responsible 
for these deplorable human rights abuses. I urge my colleagues to vote 
in favor of this crucial resolution to hold Iran's government 
accountable for its heinous repression of religious minorities.
  Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the resolution.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no further debate, the question is on 
adoption of the resolution.
  The resolution (S. Res. 74) was agreed to.
  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the Wyden substitute 
amendment at the desk to the preamble be agreed to; that the preamble, 
as amended, be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table.
  The amendment (No. 3312) to the preamble in the nature of a 
substitute was agreed to as follows:

                    (Purpose: To amend the preamble)

       Strike the preamble and insert the following:
       Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 
     2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 
     2018, 2020, and 2022, Congress declared that it deplored the 
     religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i 
     community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible 
     for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including 
     members of the Baha'i faith;
       Whereas, since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or 
     executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and more than 10,000 
     Baha'is have been dismissed from government and university 
     jobs;
       Whereas June 18, 2023, marked the 40th anniversary of the 
     execution of 10 Baha'i women by the Government of Iran, each 
     witnessing the hanging of those hanged before her in a final 
     failed attempt to induce abandonment of their faith after 
     over 6 months of imprisonment and violent abuse, with the 
     youngest only 17 years old;
       Whereas, on December 19, 2023, the United Nations General 
     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/C.3/78/L.41) calling on Iran 
     to carry out wide-ranging reforms and expressing serious 
     concerns for its escalating human rights abuses, including--
       (1) ``severe limitations and increasing restrictions on the 
     right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or 
     belief'';
       (2) ``restrictions on the establishment of places of 
     worship, undue restrictions on burials carried out in 
     accordance with religious tenets, attacks against places of 
     worship and burial'';
       (3) ``increased harassment, intimidation, persecution, 
     arbitrary arrest, and detention of, and incitement to hatred 
     that leads to violence against, persons belonging to 
     recognized and unrecognized religious minorities, including 
     Christians (particularly converts from Islam), Gonabadi 
     Dervishes, Jews, Sufi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Yarsanis, 
     Zoroastrians, and in particular, Baha'is'';
       (4) ``denial of and restrictions on access to education, 
     including for members of the Baha'i faith''; and
       (5) ``particular'' persecution of members of the Baha'i 
     community ``who have been subjected to a continued increase 
     in persecution, including attacks, harassment and targeting. 
     . .on account of their faith and have been reportedly 
     subjected to mass arrests and lengthy prison sentences, as 
     well as the arrest of prominent members and increased 
     confiscation and destruction of property'';
       Whereas, in the 2024 Annual Report of the United States 
     Commission on International Religious Freedom issued in May 
     2024, it is reported that in 2023--
       (1) the Government of Iran ``conducted individual and mass 
     arrests of Baha'is across Iran taking them to undisclosed 
     locations and imposing excessively long prison sentences'';
       (2) ``security officials beat and brutalized Baha'is during 
     raids and searches of private homes'';
       (3) ``security forces arrested scores of Baha'is in cities 
     including Hamadan, Mehrshahr, Yazd, Karaj, Alborz, and 
     Tehran'';
       (4) the ``government has targeted Baha'i women in 
     particular'' and that ``[a]pproximately two-thirds of Iranian 
     Baha'i prisoners are women'';
       (5) authorities ``targeted Baha'i cemeteries in Arak, 
     Alborz, and Golestan''; and
       (6) local ``municipalities seized and confiscated Baha'i 
     land, restricted Baha'i access to burial grounds, and 
     declared intentions to sell Baha'i-owned property exclusively 
     to Muslims.'';
       Whereas the Iran section of the Department of State's 2022 
     Report on International Religious Freedom issued in May 2023 
     provides, in part--
       (1) ``[I]n July and August, security forces in cities 
     across the country conducted multiple raids of Baha'i homes, 
     confiscated property deemed `illegitimate wealth', and 
     arrested Baha'is in their homes or workplaces on 
     unsubstantiated charges including `causing intellectual and 
     ideological insecurity in Muslim society.' '';
       (2) ``Authorities reportedly continued to deny members of 
     unrecognized religious minority groups access to education 
     and government employment unless they declared themselves as 
     belonging to one of the country's recognized religions on 
     their application forms. UN experts reported universities 
     rejected more than 90 Baha'i students between January and 
     August.''; and
       (3) ``Government officials and government-affiliated 
     organizations continued to disseminate anti-Baha'i and 
     antisemitic messages using traditional and social media.'';
       Whereas, in response to a surge in persecution in June and 
     July 2022, involving the subjection of over 100 Baha'is to 
     arrests, arraignments, sentencing, and raids on their homes 
     and businesses across Iran, including the sentencing in June 
     of 26 individuals in the city of Shiraz to a combined total 
     of 85 years in prison, the Department of State's Office of 
     International Religious Freedom issued a statement on August 
     2, 2022, indicating that ``[a]mid a continued rise in 
     arrests, sentences, and imprisonments, the U.S. urges Iran to 
     halt its ongoing oppression of the Baha'i community and honor 
     its international obligations to respect the right of all 
     Iranians to freedom of religion or belief'';
       Whereas, on November 21, 2022, Mahvash Sabet and Fariba 
     Kamalabadi, 2 former members of the informal 7-person 
     leadership group of the Baha'is of Iran, who each served 10-
     year sentences from 2008 to 2018, and have been detained 
     since July 31, 2022, in Evin prison, were sentenced to 10 
     years in prison each after a summary trial lasting 1 hour;
       Whereas, on December 11, 2022, the Baha'i International 
     Community organization stated that ``Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the 
     Nobel laureate and defence lawyer for Mahvash and Fariba 
     during their first trial, said in 2008 that `not a shred of 
     evidence' was offered to prove the national security charges 
     or other allegations. Nor was any new evidence forthcoming at 
     this latest trial'';
       Whereas, on January 12, 2024, the Baha'i International 
     Community organization reported increasing incidents of 
     persecution accompanied by intensified violence perpetrated 
     against the Baha'i community by the Government of Iran, for 
     example--
       (1) ``since the beginning of October [2023] more than 200 
     incidents of persecution, including over 50 arrests and 
     imprisonments, have occurred in various cities such as 
     Shiraz, Yazd, Isfahan, Hamadan, and Karaj'';
       (2) government agents have perpetrated ``increasingly 
     violent home raids, disproportionately affecting women and 
     the elderly, and have even resulted in hospitalizations and 
     traumatic separations of mothers from their children. 
     Notably, over two-thirds of those arrested and detained have 
     been women, predominantly in their twenties and thirties, 
     highlighting the escalation of attacks against women in 
     recent months.''; and
       (3) government agents have instigated a ``conspicuous rise 
     in hate speech, where Baha'is have been accused of being 
     behind the September 2022 protests, promoting permissiveness, 
     being against Islam and Shiism, being spies for Israel and 
     the West, and being part of a political movement that seeks 
     to undermine the state'';
       Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a 
     signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
     and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
     among other international human rights treaties, without 
     reservation;

     authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals

     Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now,

  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.
  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows:

                               S. Res. 74

       Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 
     2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 
     2018, 2020, and 2022, Congress declared that it deplored the 
     religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i 
     community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible 
     for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including 
     members of the Baha'i faith;
       Whereas, since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or 
     executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and more than 10,000 
     Baha'is have been dismissed from government and university 
     jobs;
       Whereas June 18, 2023, marked the 40th anniversary of the 
     execution of 10 Baha'i women by the Government of Iran, each 
     witnessing the hanging of those hanged before her in a final 
     failed attempt to induce abandonment of their faith after 
     over 6 months of imprisonment and violent abuse, with the 
     youngest only 17 years old;
       Whereas, on December 19, 2023, the United Nations General 
     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/C.3/78/L.41) calling on Iran 
     to carry out wide-ranging reforms and expressing serious 
     concerns for its escalating human rights abuses, including--
       (1) ``severe limitations and increasing restrictions on the 
     right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or 
     belief'';
       (2) ``restrictions on the establishment of places of 
     worship, undue restrictions on burials carried out in 
     accordance with religious tenets, attacks against places of 
     worship and burial'';
       (3) ``increased harassment, intimidation, persecution, 
     arbitrary arrest, and detention of, and incitement to hatred 
     that leads to violence against, persons belonging to 
     recognized and unrecognized religious minorities, including 
     Christians (particularly converts from Islam), Gonabadi 
     Dervishes, Jews, Sufi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Yarsanis, 
     Zoroastrians, and in particular, Baha'is'';
       (4) ``denial of and restrictions on access to education, 
     including for members of the Baha'i faith''; and
       (5) ``particular'' persecution of members of the Baha'i 
     community ``who have been subjected to a continued increase 
     in persecution, including attacks, harassment and targeting . 
     . . on account of their faith and have been reportedly 
     subjected to mass arrests and lengthy prison sentences, as 
     well as the arrest of prominent members and increased 
     confiscation and destruction of property'';
       Whereas, in the 2024 Annual Report of the United States 
     Commission on International Religious Freedom issued in May 
     2024, it is reported that in 2023--
       (1) the Government of Iran ``conducted individual and mass 
     arrests of Baha'is across Iran taking them to undisclosed 
     locations and imposing excessively long prison sentences'';
       (2) ``security officials beat and brutalized Baha'is during

     officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals

                 Tribute to Michelle Barlow Richardson

  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, it is fitting that a daughter of 
Mississippi is presiding at this poignant moment for me and for my 
entire staff.
  I come to the floor today with a forced smile and a bittersweet 
message, a bit of official news I have not been eager to report, and 
that news is that Michelle Barlow Richardson, who sits at my side at 
this very moment and who has stood by my side for a quarter century, my 
chief of staff, will soon depart Capitol Hill. This closes a 25-year 
chapter of service to my office, to the U.S. Senate and House of 
Representatives, to the State of Mississippi, and to the citizens of 
the United States.
  Anyone who knows Michelle has found out very quickly that Michelle is 
a Mississippi State Bulldog. She graduated from Mississippi State 
University in 1997 and then moved up east to Washington, DC, to begin 
work at my office. And she got right to work, beginning where many 
staffers do, as a legislative correspondent and then as an executive 
assistant. She set my schedule. She began to guide proposals into law, 
which is what we do here. Michelle would go on to higher rungs up the 
ladder, but she never lost her appreciation for every role on the team. 
And many members of the team join us in this Chamber at this moment. To 
this day, no task is too small for Michelle. She has not hesitated to 
climb into the trenches again and again.
  Michelle is fiercely loyal. Her relationship to Mississippi State 
University is a prime example of this trait. When the MSU community 
sings their school's anthem at an event, they all sing, ``Loyal friends 
we'll always be.'' Quite fitting. We even lost Michelle to Starkville 
briefly in 1999. At that point--only a couple of years out of college--
she was given the very important job of fundraising for a project that 
ended up generating over $4 million to endow a scholarship. That fund 
is helping students in Mississippi to this very day.
  But luckily, in 2001, we got her back. As I reflect on the 23 years 
that have passed since then, I am filled with gratitude for Michelle. 
And I am beaming with pride over all the good work she has 
accomplished.
  In Washington, DC--as you so poignantly know, Madam President--change 
is constant: a different Congress every 2 years, new leadership 
opportunities, Senators come and go, changing committee assignments. 
During these transitions, Michelle has been a steadfast presence, 
guiding my staff and me through numerous changes over the years.
  A big change came in 2007, not long after Michelle had been promoted 
to be my chief of staff. Our office picked up and moved to this end of 
the Capitol when I was selected to fill the seat vacated by U.S. 
Senator Trent Lott. The success of that transition is due, in no small 
part, to Michelle's deep institutional knowledge, broad networks, and 
natural leadership skills.
  The next year, to the extent permitted by the law and the rules, she 
helped lead my first statewide election campaign. She expanded a 
campaign and fundraising organization that she had developed in the 
First Congressional District, and she applied it to all of our great 
State of Mississippi.
  Of course, when you get elected, you have to govern. And over here on 
the Senate side, Michelle once again rose to the challenge of a larger 
role in governing. She scaled up the size of ``Team Wicker'' from 18 
people to 45 teammates across 5 offices.
  Over the years, she also established a network of Senate chiefs of 
staff. In fact, it is known throughout Capitol Hill that Michelle 
Barlow Richardson has become the ``dean'' of the Senate chiefs of 
staff. That is what we are losing tomorrow when she moves to another 
capacity. Michelle has built a community where collaboration, 
information, and mutual support can flow.
  Then, in 2016, we had another transition. I was elected to chair of 
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and, as usual, Michelle 
was right there to help. Under her leadership, the office adjusted to 
new responsibilities and certainly new schedules.
  A few years after that, I took up the gavel on the Senate Commerce 
Committee. Michelle helped build a team of policy experts who would 
craft smart legislation on the vast portfolio of the Commerce 
Committee--everything from the seabed to the stars.
  President Ronald Reagan once said that ``personnel is policy.'' Well, 
Michelle and the personnel she has cultivated have gone on to produce 
substantive and savvy policy. She has been pivotal to work that has 
brought billions of dollars in new jobs and new investments to 
Mississippi. Through years of legislative efforts, Michelle has been 
making connections, educating stakeholders, and holding our strong 
legislative principles--and holding our feet to the fire. Through every 
negotiation and late night, she has been motivating our staff.
  In scaling up the staff from the House team to the much larger Senate 
team, over the years, Michelle has led literally hundreds of able staff 
members.
  Her leadership left an incredible legacy. Michelle was good at 
identifying talent. She has challenged staffers to accomplish goals 
they did not know they were capable of reaching. She has embraced the 
burden of making tough decisions. She has delivered tough but 
constructive feedback directly and concisely, without ever making it 
personal. And a massive cloud of witnesses can testify to her 
influence. Many former Wicker staffers are now serving in leadership 
roles around the country. I am the one privileged to give this floor 
speech, but I know many could give speeches--and perhaps will give 
speeches--of their own, telling the stories of Michelle's influence in 
their lives.

[[Page S6834]]

  Those who know Michelle Barlow Richardson know her for her strong 
devotion and friendship. That is especially true for my wife Gayle and 
me. Michelle's title has been chief of staff, but she has been so much 
more. She has been by our side in public service and in private moments 
and moments of joy and moments of pain.
  Words are inadequate, and these remarks, in particular, are 
inadequate. We will miss Michelle's enthusiasm for all things 
Mississippi. We will miss the presence she--and occasionally her 
children--have brought to the office. We will even miss the Mississippi 
State University maroon and cowbell. But loyal friends we will 
certainly always be. We will remain grateful for her friendship, and we 
wish her, this public servant and American patriot, the very best.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.


                              Nominations

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, if there is one thing we have 
learned from last month's election, it is that President Trump has a 
clear mandate from the American people to get this country back on 
track, and one of the things that Tennesseans talk to me most about is 
the need to restore law and order all across this country.
  I am so encouraged by President Trump's nominees who are going to 
take the lead in reforming our Federal law enforcement Agencies, and, 
today, I want to touch on two of those who are reforming law 
enforcement Agencies.
  I will tell the Presiding Officer, next week, I am going to come and 
talk about the nominees for our military and national security. I want 
to talk about the qualifications of Pete Hegseth, who is going to be a 
great Secretary of Defense; but, today, we are going to talk about Kash 
Patel at the FBI and Pam Bondi at the Justice Department.
  Now, these two Agencies--I think everybody agrees--are in desperate 
need of a course correction. Under the Biden-Harris administration, 
they have repeatedly undermined the rule of law with a two-tiered 
justice system. Its rules are simple: If you break the law and you are 
a Democrat, then you are off the hook--that is the way they have 
operated--but if you are a conservative or you dissent from the left's 
radical agenda, the government will end up targeting you for your 
beliefs.
  What we know is that, under Mr. Patel and Ms. Bondi, this abuse of 
power will come to an end, and few people are better qualified to get 
this job done and enforce the rule of law than Ms. Bondi and Mr. Patel.
  As a former prosecutor for the Justice Department--and, by the way, 
he worked under Democrats and Republicans--Mr. Patel led the successful 
prosecutions of criminals that were tied to terrorist organizations 
like al-Qaida and ISIS.
  On the House Intel Committee, he worked with Congressman Devin Nunes, 
the chair of that committee, to expose the FBI and the Justice 
Department's abuses during Russiagate, or the Russia hoax, as it became 
known.
  In the first Trump administration, he served as the Deputy Director 
of National Intelligence. He served at the Security Council and the 
Defense Department as Chief of Staff.
  This is a varied background. It is a credible background for the job 
in front of him of restoring law and order in our cities across this 
country, in countering terror threats, and in ending human trafficking, 
and that is the job of the FBI.
  I will say this on the human trafficking: I am especially encouraged 
by his support for releasing the Jeffrey Epstein flight logs and black 
book. We know the abuse spanned decades from Mr. Epstein, and it harmed 
many vulnerable young girls, and we know a large network of high-
profile, high-dollar predators participated in this horrific abuse on a 
global level. So, by releasing the flight logs, we can start to break 
apart the sex trafficking rings and ensure that the predators are put 
in jail where they belong. This effort will go a long way in restoring 
public confidence in the FBI and in ending the left's two-tiered 
justice system. On this front, he will work closely with Pam Bondi, who 
is President Trump's excellent choice for Attorney General.
  Earlier this week, I had my official meeting with Ms. Bondi, whom I 
have known and worked with for over the past decade. Our meeting only 
reaffirmed my conviction that she will be fearless in rooting out 
corruption, taking on the deep state, and restoring the Justice 
Department to its core mission: enforcing equal justice under the law.
  To be certain, her accomplishments speak for themselves. With more 
than 18 years of experience as a prosecutor, she became the first woman 
to serve as the attorney general of Florida in 2011. While there, she 
worked to protect the most vulnerable among us by taking on drug 
dealers and human traffickers.
  During the first Trump administration, she also worked to end our 
Nation's drug epidemic as a member of the Opioid and Drug Abuse 
Commission. This experience will be invaluable to her as she leads this 
top law enforcement Agency.
  Kash Patel and Pam Bondi are just two of Trump's incredible picks, 
but they are representative of the talent, experience, and 
determination shown by his Cabinet selections and nominees. As we head 
into the new year, I will look forward to supporting them and ensuring 
that they can get to work as soon as possible for the American people.


                         Kids Online Safety Act

  Madam President, although we have a busy end of year ahead of us, 
there is at least one thing Congress must do before the end of the 
year, and that is to pass the very bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act.
  Back in July, this Chamber passed KOSA by an overwhelming bipartisan 
majority. The vote was 91 to 3. The reason is very simple: Lawmakers on 
both sides of the aisle recognize that Big Tech must be held 
accountable for putting our children's safety at risk. They have put 
profit ahead of our children's safety, and they want to continue to do 
that.
  KOSA puts the priority on safety by providing parents and kids with 
tools, safeguards, and the transparency that they need to protect 
against online harms. Among its provisions, the legislation would 
create a duty of care for online platforms to prevent and mitigate 
specific dangers to minors, including the promotion of suicide, eating 
disorders, substance abuse, and sexual exploitation.
  Since KOSA's passage in the Senate, more and more evidence has 
emerged showing that this legislation is desperately needed. In 
October, for example, reports emerged showing that Chinese-owned 
TikTok purposefully developed algorithms to keep children scrolling as 
long as they could. Of course, the more time a child spends on the 
platform the more data TikTok can collect, then the more valuable that 
platform becomes.

  While this happens, TikTok executives privately acknowledge that such 
addiction does lead to mental health issues, including a loss of memory 
and cognition. But do you know what? They don't care. When your child 
is online, they are the profit. They are a profit center for these 
platforms.
  Now, other platforms, from Facebook to Instagram, have also developed 
addictive algorithms that expose children to unthinkable harms, 
including sexual abuse and lethal drugs. But, again, these platforms 
don't care. They do not give a ripping flip about your child.
  This tragedy has got to come to an end, but for months, KOSA has been 
held up in the House because of blatant falsehoods that are being 
pushed by Big Tech lobbyists. We know who they are, and we know what 
they are saying. Let me just read some of these falsehoods to you.
  They say that KOSA would censor free speech, and it will not. KOSA is 
a product design bill. It is not a contact bill.
  There are some out there who say: Well, it is going to give all of 
this authority to the FTC. It does not. It does not increase the 
authority of the FTC. It is important to note that there is no new 
rulemaking power for the FTC in KOSA or any ability to create rules 
about content. So they are lying. The lobbyists and some of these House 
staffers who are listening to these lobbyists are spreading falsehoods. 
It should come to a stop. Our children deserve better.
  We know that what KOSA will do is put in place tools for parents, 
and, of course, Big Tech is out here spreading

[[Page S6835]]

lies and having their lobbyists spread lies because they want to evade 
accountability on this. I have even heard this: I have heard of 
staffers in the House and lobbyists bragging that they have been able 
to kill KOSA, that they are going to keep this profit center going, 
that they have been able to kill this bill. It is absolutely disgusting 
that they would agree with Big Tech and put that number--that dollar 
figure--on our kids' heads.
  Do you know, when we were doing the hearings on this, what did we 
hear from kid after kid who came in? They came in wearing a T-shirt, 
``270,'' saying: I am worth more than $270. That is the value that some 
of these platforms have assigned to the amount of time a child spends 
on their platform. That is the profit they make.
  You know, if you listen to some of these staffers and some of these 
lobbyists, you would think, my goodness, if we don't need to have some 
kind of protections in the virtual space, why do we have laws in the 
physical space to protect kids? Minors can't enter into a contract. 
Minors can't go buy alcohol and tobacco. If you have got a store that 
sells liquor and you sell to a kid, they will come, put the chains on 
your store, and close you down. It is the same thing with alcohol and 
the same thing with pornography.
  The Presiding Officer and I are parents. I am a grandparent. We see 
what is happening to these precious children, and they are being 
subjected to drugs, to alcohol; they are being subjected to 
pornography; they are being subjected to sexual exploitation, and it is 
done 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and yet Big 
Tech--they don't care. They do not care about protecting your children. 
So the only thing we are left to surmise is, if they don't protect them 
in the virtual space, they are, for sure, not going to support 
protecting them in the physical space. I would surmise that people who 
are against KOSA would do away with all of these laws that protect 
children.
  Society has decided our precious children are worth the fight, that 
they are worth the protection. And it is disgusting--disgusting--when 
you hear these Big Tech platforms say there is a value to keeping that 
child scrolling, that there is a value to holding their eyes online--
and when you hear it repeated by people in our Chambers--staffers--it 
is sickening.
  This is not a political game. Protecting our children is something 
that we in the Senate have agreed to do on a bipartisan basis. This 
bill has been stuck in the House since July. We know why it has been 
stuck, and we know that falsehoods are being spread. This is a bill 
that deserves a vote on the House floor because what we do know is 
this: By an overwhelming bipartisan majority, Members of the U.S. House 
of Representatives support this bill. It is time for those who are 
standing in the way of passing this bill to put aside--to put aside--
their objections and to allow protections for our children to take 
place in the virtual space.
  Since 1998, there has not been any additional protection placed in 
the virtual space. Why is that? It is because Big Tech sees our kids as 
a product. They make a lot of money--a whole lot of money--when those 
kids are scrolling. It is killing our kids. Just as in the physical 
world we put in place laws to protect them, they deserve the same 
protections in that virtual space.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant executive clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helmy). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                       Corporate Transparency Act

  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, for over a year, I have worked to get 
rid of a rule that is driving every one of my small businesses in 
Oklahoma absolutely crazy. A lot of Americans have no idea what the 
beneficial ownership rule is, but if you own a small business in 
America, you definitely know.
  To set the context for this, next week, we are supposed to take up 
the national defense authorization. In 2021, a small, little section 
was stuck in at the end in the large national defense authorization 
that was called the corporate transparency beneficial ownership act. 
That little bill was supposed to root out money laundering and fraud. 
What it has become has been a nightmare for every business owner in my 
State.
  If you are a business owner that has a business that is a small 
business--let's say less than 20 employees, less than $5 million in 
total revenue in a year--you now have to fill out this enormous set of 
forms and turn them in to the Federal Government to show your ownership 
structure to the Federal Government so they can track it.
  I will tell you, there are quite a few business owners that don't own 
one business; they may own two or three businesses or they may own 
several LLCs if they are a builder or they are a property developer, if 
they do all kinds of property construction for small businesses and 
building for others. They will own several LLCs, and now they have a 
stack of forms they have to fill out. They have to fill out forms now 
that talk about their name, their birth date, their address, an ID 
number, and all of it. They want to know all the reporting for their 
legal address, their address, the jurisdiction of their information. 
They want to know all the senior officers of the reporting company. 
They want to know someone who has the authority over the appointment or 
the removal of those senior officers. This is my favorite: They want to 
know substantial influencers over the decisions in the company. No one 
even knows what that means. Who is your substantial influence in your 
small business?
  All those things all have to be compiled by business owners that 
literally do their own books, that do their own purchasing, that do 
their own payroll. They have plenty of other things to do other than 
the requirement to fill out forms.
  Now, it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was just a form that 
dropped into their box, but it is a form dropped into their box, and it 
had this little note attached to it: If you don't fill this out or you 
fill it out wrong, it is a $10,000 fine and up to 2 years in prison for 
not filling this form out--2 years in prison for not filling out this 
form outlining who influences you in your decisions in your small 
business.
  When this was stuck into the national defense authorization in 2021, 
it was supposed to root out fraud and waste, but it has grown through 
regulations and is now poured out with a deadline that is literally a 
couple of weeks away.
  I have fought for a year. Senator Tuberville has a bill to be able to 
end this entirely. We got no traction on that. We couldn't even get a 
vote in this Senate to be able to stop this nightmare. So I brought a 
second bill to say let's just delay it so it is not happening this 
year, and we have worked for months to be able to get that delay in, 
and we have not been able to get a vote on that in this Senate.
  While small businesses all over my State are furious about this, we 
have tried to just say: Somebody needs to show some common sense and to 
stop asking these questions. Thankfully, in the last 72 hours, a 
Federal judge has stepped in and has halted this nationwide, has 
prevented the Biden administration from actually implementing this rule 
that they created. In fact, this judge called this regulation quasi-
Orwellian, also determined this--saying the ``government is unable to 
provide the court with any tenable theory that [this regulation] falls 
within Congress's power. [It] appears likely unconstitutional.'' I 
absolutely agree.
  I am grateful this judge has stepped in to be able to stop its 
implementation, but I am going to still ask this Senate to do the same 
thing we have asked all year; that is, to stop it entirely.
  We should not be asking these questions of every small business in 
America. That is not our job, to ask every small business owner in 
America: Turn in who are the influencers on your decisionmaking or we 
will put you in prison for 2 years.
  What in the world?
  So I am grateful for the stop, but we also will not stop until we 
actually pull this entire thing out and say this is not our job. We 
have plenty of things that are our job that we are not doing. For

[[Page S6836]]

instance, next week--the national defense authorization, passed on a 
bipartisan basis through committee months ago, has yet to come to the 
Senate floor. It is time for it to be able to come, long past overdue. 
This sets our military strategy and what we are going to do for our 
vets and for the members of Active-Duty Reserves and National Guard. 
This should have been done a long time ago.
  Those are the things we should already be doing. Going to business 
owners and telling them ``Tell us who your influencers are'' are things 
we should not be doing.


                  Department of Government Efficiency

  Mr. President, I left a meeting just now dealing with the newly named 
Department of Government Efficiency, where Members of the House and 
Senate gathered around Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswarmy and asked 
questions of each other: What can we do to make government more 
efficient?
  This shouldn't be a partisan organization. In fact, there are 
Democrats that have joined us in this conversation. I find no one in my 
great State of Oklahoma who says: You know what I really want from my 
government? I want them to be inefficient. I want them to waste my 
money. I want my government to spend money on things that really don't 
matter for the country.
  Every person that I meet in my State--Republican, Democrat, or 
Independent--all say the same thing: The government should do its job 
and not somebody else's job. When you spend my money, spend it wisely.
  We all know we need roads. We all know we need national defense. We 
all know we need border security. There are key things we all need to 
do. But there are some things that continue to be able to pop up where 
money is being spent that there is great frustration in my State and a 
great number of people that say: Why are we spending money on that?
  We spent money 2 years ago, as a Federal tax dollar, and the people 
in my State of Oklahoma had to spend their hard-earned tax money on 
paying for drag shows in Ecuador. We have money that was spent on 
writing the book about humans, chimpanzees, and climate change in 
Sierra Leone. We spent some of our hard-earned tax dollars on doing a 
study about seatbelts and helmet usage in Ghana.
  The folks in Oklahoma asked a very simple question. We want the pot 
holes fixed. We want efficient government. We want education taken care 
of. We want good schools. Why are we spending our dollars--that are 
limited dollars--on doing a helmet study in Ghana? Why aren't we doing 
that in the United States? Why aren't we taking care of us?
  It is not that we are selfish; it is just that we all know we are $36 
trillion in debt. Every single year, I put out a book called ``Federal 
Fumbles.'' Every year, I bring it to this body. Every year, we talk 
about inefficiency and waste in government.
  I am grateful that there is a bipartisan conversation finally started 
that is spreading among this body and the House body and now the new 
incoming executive branch saying: Let's find areas of efficiency where 
we can be better at this.
  The basic goal is this: Let's have a prosperous Nation that actually 
has economic growth and an efficient government that matches the 
efficiency of you our Nation. That shouldn't be an irrational goal. 
That should be something we could all agree on. Quite frankly, it is 
just Oklahomans saying: Don't waste my money. Spend it in the way you 
are supposed to spend it, and let me keep the dollars that I have 
earned. And when my tax dollars go away, don't make me be embarrassed 
how they are used.
  That shouldn't be irrational. I am going to continue to press on 
this.
  Five years ago, we passed a bill called the Taxpayers Right-to-Know 
Act. I worked with the Biden administration for the last several years. 
It has created something called the Federal Program Inventory. As crazy 
as it sounds, for the first time ever, we are actually building a list 
of all the Federal programs we have in the Federal Government. Many 
people don't know that we literally have so many programs that we don't 
know how many programs we have in the Federal Government. Just try to 
do an internet search and ask a simple question of AI: How many 
programs do we have in the Federal Government? It will give you an 
estimate because there is no master list of all the programs in the 
Federal Government.
  So I passed a law called the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act requiring 
Agencies to do something crazy: Make a list of all the programs that 
you do. Where is our money being spent? And that list is in the process 
of being built right now that will give us the ability to see where we 
have duplication in government. It will give the ability from one 
Agency to look at another Agency and say: I didn't realize we did the 
same thing.
  That is happening all over our government right now.
  Again, that is straightforward. But it gives us an opportunity to 
say: Make a list, prioritize the list, and then draw a line and say 
these things are not our priorities; these things are. And when you are 
$36 trillion in debt, we should be talking about doing our priorities 
and not doing the things that are not a priority. This is what we 
should do in this body and to be able to have this kind of 
conversation.
  So, for me, it is simple. Let's do the things that we should do. 
Let's don't do the things we shouldn't do because there are plenty of 
things that still need to get done.
  I yield the floor.

Massachusetts.


                      Social Security Fairness Act

  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am actually joined here today with my 
Massachusetts staff, who is joining with my Washington staff, and they 
are in the Gallery today. The subject I am about to talk to is very 
near and dear to their hearts. It is near the top of the list of all 
the issues they think go to fundamental unfairness in our society, 
because right now, an entire generation of teachers and firefighters 
and postal workers and police officers and public servants of all 
stripes are being denied the Social Security benefits which they 
earned.
  In 1983, the so-called windfall elimination provision slashed 
retirement benefits in the name of austerity. I was a Member of the 
House of Representatives in the U.S. Congress in 1983. I voted against 
the windfall elimination provision. I voted against Republicans. I 
voted against many Democrats who all were willing to slash the benefits 
of those hard-working teachers, firefighters, police officers, across 
the board--and have lost it for four decades--because I knew that I was 
voting for public servants and voting for their families.
  I have been fighting for repeal of the windfall elimination provision 
as well as the government pension offset ever since, and I stand here 
today because we have an opportunity to finally see this repeal through 
to conclusion.
  Senator Brown and Senator Collins' Social Security Fairness Act would 
repeal the windfall elimination provision and the government offset 
provision. I am proud to cosponsor that bill, alongside 60 of my 
colleagues from both parties, and 60 is the number you need to pass a 
bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We can restore Social Security 
benefits for millions of workers now, and we should do it now.
  Three million--unbelievable--three million public servants and their 
families around the country, including 130,000 in Massachusetts and 
their families, are counting on us to get them their earned benefits. 
They have already done the work, but a 1983 law denies them that check 
in the mail.
  No one else in the country was targeted in that bill--just those 
public servants, those people who work for each and every one of us 
every single day.
  A retired public school teacher in Chicopee, MA, wrote to me and 
explained that she had dutifully paid into Social Security for decades, 
earning her right to Social Security and a secure retirement. But late 
in her career, she answered the call to public service and dedicated 
her time to educating students in Massachusetts. That is the kind of 
action we should value and we should reward. Instead, she was 
blindsided 10 years later to learn that because of her public service 
and the modest public pension she accrued, her Social Security benefits 
would be cut by $580 a month, which otherwise would be there on her 
kitchen table for

[[Page S6837]]

herself, for her family. Now, instead of a secure and dignified 
retirement, she has to worry about affording rent and medication and 
groceries.
  If, instead of teaching, she had earned a private pension, she had 
worked in any other sector of the American economy or she was wealthy 
enough to live off of her investments, her Social Security would be 
safe. The only category is these people who were the public servants. 
They are the ones who got targeted in 1983.
  Another constituent from Tyngsboro, MA, wrote me to say that after 
her father passed away, her mother, a retired school employee, lost 
over $1,000 a month in Social Security. Now, in addition to mourning 
her husband, she also struggles to pay bills and meet her basic needs.
  There are 3 million more stories of injustice and indignity just like 
this.
  We know the Federal Government can be in the business of allowing 
windfalls. Major corporations hiking up prices on the American people 
while paying effectively no Federal taxes--that is a windfall. Private 
equity cronies making millions off the backs of workers while laying 
them off and gutting their pensions--that is a windfall. But make no 
mistake, allowing a third grade teacher, a town firefighter, and a 
mailman to receive their hard-earned retirement benefits is not a 
windfall.
  Repealing these draconian policies is a matter of justice and dignity 
for millions of public servants. These workers served their communities 
and delivered for us every single day. In every city and town across 
the country--Massachusetts, the President's home State of 
Pennsylvania--State after State, the story is the same, and now it is 
time for us to deliver for them.
  After four decades of fighting and organizing alongside unions and 
workers and retirees, Congress must repeal these policies once and for 
all. The Senate may be short on time, but public servants have waited 
long enough.
  In the time remaining this year, we must deliver for those 3 million 
families in our country. They earned this benefit. We have to finally 
meet the obligation which has been accrued by the American people to 
those 3 million workers.
  So let's vote to pass the Social Security Fairness Act. Bring home 
this win for public servants, their families, and our communities.
  No matter where you live in America, when you see that firefighter on 
the fire engine, when you see that police officer rushing to protect a 
family, when you call the teacher to ask ``How is my child doing?''--
every time you make one of those calls, every time you see one of those 
people, just know that they are denied--they are denied the benefit 
which they have earned. They are denied it by an act of the U.S. 
Congress in 1983.
  Why them? Why were they singled out? Why wasn't it billionaires? Why 
wasn't it private equity? Well, the votes were there, and, 
unfortunately, too many Democrats voted for it as well.
  It is time for us to rectify that historic injustice. It is time for 
us to provide fundamental fairness for each and every one of those 
families. This is the time; this is the place; we are the people who 
must get this done. It goes right to the heart of who we are as a 
people. If you believe in government, then you must believe in 
everything that teachers and firefighters and police and everyone else 
who is in our cities and towns provide for us every single day. And we 
must have that vote on the Senate floor. We must pass this legislation. 
We must finally give back to these families what they have earned by 
their service to us.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.


                                 Sudan

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss 
the terrible ongoing humanitarian situation in Sudan, and the 
atrocities that are being perpetrated against innocent civilians there 
every day and to discuss measures that the United States and the U.S. 
Senate can take to help end the suffering.
  Since that brutal conflict erupted in April 2023, a staggering 11.8 
million people have been displaced within Sudan or fled to neighboring 
countries. More than half the population--over 25 million people--face 
acute food insecurity, including 13 million children. And 1.5 million 
of them are at risk of or facing famine.
  While the total casualty numbers have been difficult to determine, a 
new study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's 
Sudan Research Group estimates that more than 60,000 people died in the 
Khartoum region alone between April 2023 and June of 2024. That study 
found that 26,000 people have died as a result of violence. But it also 
highlighted another awful reality, that starvation and disease are 
increasingly becoming the leading causes of death reported across 
Sudan.
  In a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May of this 
year, U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan Tom Perriello suggested that the 
total death toll could be as high as 150,000 people.
  Given the scope and scale of this human suffering, the United States 
and the international community should be doing everything in our power 
to end the carnage and end the suffering in Sudan. Toward that end, I 
want to commend America's Special Envoy to Sudan Tom Perriello for his 
tireless shuttle diplomacy and his ongoing efforts to seek and 
negotiate an agreement to end the conflict that is fueling this crisis. 
But he can't do it alone. And his job is made much more difficult when 
other parts of the U.S. Government fail to effectively use our leverage 
to support his efforts.
  One thing we should not be doing is shipping advanced American 
weapons to any country that is fueling the misery and suffering and 
killing in Sudan, and yet that is what the Biden administration is 
proposing to do. They are proposing to send weapons to the United Arab 
Emirates at a time that the UAE is reportedly supplying weapons to a 
vile and murderous militia group in Sudan, a group called the Rapid 
Support Forces, or the RSF for short.
  So I am here on the floor today urging my colleagues to prevent the 
sale of American weapons to the UAE until and unless the Biden 
administration provides us--the Senate, the Congress--with credible 
assurances that the UAE will not, in turn, supply additional weapons to 
the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan.
  So let me step back for a moment to put all of this in context. About 
3\1/2\ years ago in May of 2021, I traveled to Khartoum, the capital of 
Sudan, with my colleague Senator Coons. At the time, Sudan was 
experiencing a difficult transition to democracy after a popular 
revolution in 2019 succeeded in ousting the brutal regime of the 
dictator Omar Bashir. It wasn't easy, but there was hope for a brighter 
future.
  Then the Sudanese Armed Forces--or the SAF--and the Rapid Support 
Forces--the RSF--who had backed the popular protests in 2019 and who 
had helped oust the dictator Bashir usurped the newly formed civilian-
led government in 2021 and then proceeded to violently suppress mass 
protests.
  Following pressure, both from the people of Sudan but also from the 
international community, to restore the civilian government and merge 
their forces, instead, a long-simmering rivalry between the SAF and the 
RSF erupted in April 2023, and Sudan descended into chaos and civil 
war.
  Now, there is plenty of blame to go around, but one of the many 
drivers of the collapse of the fragile democracy was the refusal of the 
Rapid Support Forces, that militia group, to come under the umbrella of 
the Sudanese Armed Forces.
  And the RSF has an especially sinister lineage. They have their roots 
in the Janjaweed militias that former dictator Bashir used to brutally 
crush rebellious tribes in the western Darfur region in the early 
2000s. I think many who followed those terrible days remember that the 
United States determined that those mass killings constituted genocide.
  The current leader of the RSF goes by the name Hemedti. He is a 
former Janjaweed militia leader who was complicit in those atrocities 
in Darfur, and he hasn't changed.
  In the current conflict, the United States has charged the RSF with 
committing ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
  Reputable human rights organizations and news outlets have also 
reported widespread acts of sexual violence, including rape, by the 
RSF.

[[Page S6838]]

  As our Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield noted 
in March of this year:

       Children are starving . . . wasting, [and] dying. Far from 
     their homes and their communities, millions of refugees are 
     praying in over-crowded camps.
       People in Darfur . . . wake up not to the call of prayer, 
     but to the sound of gunfire, of shelling, of cries for help.

  And the situation has not improved since then. Famine has taken hold 
in Darfur, and the RSF's siege of Al-Fashir city in Darfur has only 
exacerbated the already terrible humanitarian situation there.
  So it should be clear that providing weapons to the RSF is tantamount 
to aiding and abetting ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, 
and yet that is what the UAE is reportedly doing.
  Now, I should make it very clear that the UAE denies that it is 
arming the RSF. They say they are not doing it. Indeed, when I traveled 
to the UAE in July of this year, Emirati officials told me they were 
not sending weapons to the RSF. And yet numerous credible reports and 
sources indicate just the opposite. They reveal that the UAE is, in 
fact, supplying the murderous RSF militia with weapons that they use to 
commit atrocities.
  In January, a U.N. panel of experts documented what they described as 
``credible'' allegations that the UAE was violating the Darfur arms 
embargo, which was the embargo put in place in 2005 to stop the 
genocide at that time.
  Their findings have been corroborated by credible human rights 
organizations and by an independent investigation by the New York 
Times, which found that the UAE smuggled weapons to the RSF under the 
guise of humanitarian aid. The front page story of the New York Times--
and I have it here, Mr. President--is entitled ``How a U.S. Ally Uses 
Aid as a Cover in War.''
  And they go on to point out that the UAE is expanding a covert 
campaign to back a winner in Sudan's civil war, and they point out that 
the UAE was smuggling in weapons and deploying drones.
  Beyond the New York Times independent investigation, the Sudan 
Conflict Observatory group--which is a group funded by the State 
Department--also tracked 32 Emirati flights between June 2023 and May 
2024 going into Sudan, and they concluded--again, this is a group 
funded by the U.S. Department of State. They concluded with ``near 
certainty'' that they constituted weapons transfers from the UAE to the 
RSF.
  Now, the Biden administration has also acknowledged that the UAE has 
been supporting the RSF, although you have to read carefully between 
the lines to determine that.
  Again, our Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Thomas-
Greenfield, said:

       We are aware that both sides are receiving weapons and 
     other support to fuel their efforts to destroy Sudan, and 
     yes, we have engaged with the parties on that, including with 
     our colleagues from the UAE.''

  So the question is this: If the Biden administration acknowledges 
that the UAE is arming the RSF against our demands and our interests 
and that they are lying about it, why are we, the United States, not 
doing more to stop it?
  I understand that we have a very important bilateral relationship 
with the UAE. They are an important security partner in the Middle 
East. Major American companies, like Microsoft, are talking about 
collaborating on building data centers for advanced AI in the UAE with 
companies like G42. They may also be cooperating with us on other 
important American priorities. But that is not a good reason to approve 
this sale of advanced weapons to the UAE at a time that the UAE is 
reportedly aiding and abetting ethnic cleansing and crimes against 
humanity in Sudan.
  That is why I have filed what is known as a joint resolution of 
disapproval--known by its shorthand, JRD--on the Biden administration's 
request to sell offensive weapons, including weapons worth $1.2 billion 
to the United Arab Emirates. In the House of Representatives, 
Congresswoman Sara Jacobs has filed a similar resolution, and both of 
us have introduced additional legislation on this issue.
  And I would submit that, if any Senator is serious about ending the 
suffering in Sudan, we should not be sending weapons to any country--in 
this case, the UAE--that is arming those engaged in ethnic cleansing 
there.
  A lot of Senators have talked about the need to focus on ending the 
humanitarian disaster in Sudan, and they are absolutely right to do so. 
Many of us have been addressing this and talking about it for a very 
long time. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had an important 
hearing on this matter in May of this year.
  But, colleagues, you don't end the horrific suffering in Sudan by 
sending weapons to a country that is fueling the conflict in Sudan. 
That is why I am asking the Biden administration to provide us--the 
Senate, the Congress--with assurances that they have received credible 
commitments that the UAE will not send weapons to the murderous RSF in 
Sudan.
  And I would submit that, given the fact that the UAE denies that they 
are engaged in such actions, they should be able to provide assurances 
that the Biden administration deems credible. And if President Biden 
believes that those assurances are credible, he should so inform the 
U.S. Senate as we consider their request for this arms sale.
  As Representative Jacobs and I indicated in our letter to President 
Biden that we sent a short time ago, if we receive those assurances, we 
will, of course, take them into account as to how we decide to proceed 
on the joint resolution of disapproval. I say that because our goal is 
not to prevent the sale of arms to the UAE. The objective is to ensure 
that the UAE is not fueling the very crisis and conflict in Sudan that 
we, the United States, are seeking to end.
  Indeed, in September of this year, President Biden said:

       The United States will not abandon our commitment to the 
     people of Sudan, who deserve freedom, peace, and justice. We 
     call on all parties to this conflict to end the violence and 
     refrain from fueling it, for the future of Sudan and for all 
     Sudanese people.

  I will say that again: and to all people who are fueling it.
  The Biden administration has rightly put pressure on the RSF by 
sanctioning several high-level commanders for their atrocities, but it 
has yet to use the full leverage at its disposal to hold their primary 
external backer, the UAE, accountable. Indeed, just days after the New 
York Times story about their independent investigation of UAE arms 
sales to Sudan broke, the President finalized a major defense 
partnership with the UAE. And now, as we see, the administration is 
pushing for a billion dollars-plus arms sale to the Emirati Government.
  The title of an op-ed in the Washington Post not that long ago put it 
bluntly, and I just quote the title of that editorial: ``Biden needs to 
pressure the UAE to help end Sudan's civil war.''
  That is exactly right. And that is what we are calling on the Biden 
administration to do. I support a mutually beneficial bilateral 
relationship with the United Arab Emirates, and I am certainly not 
seeking to permanently end arms sales to that country. But a 
partnership with the United States needs to account for U.S. interests 
and values and priorities, and we need to make sure that foreign 
governments that benefit from a security relationship with the United 
States understand the importance that we hold on those important 
issues.
  The bottom line is that the United States should not be sending 
weapons to the UAE so long as it is aiding and abetting a group that is 
one of the primary drivers of the humanitarian disaster in Sudan, the 
RSF. And the RSF has committed atrocities and crimes. That is why the 
United States should pause offensive arms transfers to the UAE unless 
and until the Biden administration can provide the U.S. Congress with 
assurances that the UAE is not providing and will no longer provide 
materiel support that aids and abets the killing spree of the RSF.
  I hope that the Senate will come together on this important question, 
and I hope the President and the Biden administration will agree that 
securing those assurances from the UAE is essential to our goal of 
achieving peace and stability in Sudan, just as the President indicated 
we should be doing.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.

                       REMEMBERING JOHN A. SPRING

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 2004, the city of Quincy, IL, elected a 
new mayor. In musing on how he intended to lead, he said: ``It's not 
about me. One person can't make everything happen. You've got to have a 
team.'' And while it may be true that great leaders need great teams 
supporting them, John Spring was the kind of leader, mayor, and 
community advocate you wanted leading your team. Today, it is with 
great sadness that I share the news of John's passing.
  A native of Rock Island, IL, John graduated from Quincy College where 
he met his future wife Karen, who sadly passed away in 2021. They were 
married for 50 years. A theme that remained consistent throughout 
John's life was his dedication to serving his community. He first 
answered the call to service through teaching. John worked as a teacher 
in St. Louis and in the Quincy Public Schools, before he was hired at 
Quincy Notre Dame High School in 1976 as a biology teacher and 
assistant basketball and football coach.
  His time at Quincy Notre Dame would provide him with one of his first 
leadership opportunities, when halfway through the school year, he was 
asked to put aside his teaching duties and serve as the school's first 
full-time director of development. He readily accepted the challenge. 
However, what John was not told when he was offered the job was that 
the school was in financial trouble, having borrowed more than $100,000 
from a local bank to cover operation costs. For many, raising that sum 
of money would be an overwhelmingly daunting task. But believing in the 
importance of investing in quality educations for young people, John 
went to work. Soon after, the school's first fund drive--a way to raise 
money to cover the gap between the cost of running the school and the 
amount of tuition the school must charge--was born. It has since become 
a mainstay of Quincy Notre Dame's fundraising efforts.
  Proving his leadership abilities and commitment to the school, John 
went on to become the executive director of the Quincy Notre Dame 
Foundation for 29 years. He loved the work. So, what might have 
compelled him to leave that role? A call to serve his community in 
another manner: as mayor. He first experienced Quincy's political scene 
as a member of the police and fire commission, and when then-mayor of 
Quincy Chuck Scholz decided in the fall of 2004 not to run for a fourth 
term, John once again answered the call to serve his community. His 
vision was simple: making life better for everyone in the community.
  John served as Quincy's mayor for 8 years. He was a community 
favorite. During his tenure, he focused on updating transportation 
infrastructure and regional partnerships as a way to foster long-term 
economic growth. And, surprising to no one who knew John, he found 
success. During his tenure, he led successful efforts to expand Amtrak 
service to the city, upgrade Maine Street, and implement a multiyear 
infrastructure plan. And during the 2008 recession that saw many 
communities suffer, under John's leadership, Quincy opened new 
businesses, lowered taxes, and helped the county report the second-best 
employment record in the State.
  His contributions to the community did not go unrecognized. In 2018, 
John was inducted into the Quincy Notre Dame Hall of Fame, and 
recently, he was selected as a 2024 delegate to the Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago.
  Like every good elected official ought to be, John was an attentive 
listener, a caring community member, and a truly decent man. In all 
things John did, he led with compassion, humility, and grace. He was a 
visionary leader who truly represented the best of us. Time and time 
again, his community called him to serve. And time and time again, he 
answered the call faithfully. Until the end, John would send my staff 
and me community updates and ideas to improve the lives of the citizens 
of West Central Illinois.
  Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to John's children--
Stacey, John, and Mike--and seven grandchildren as they cope with his 
tremendous loss. It was a privilege to call John a friend, and we will 
miss him dearly.

                     RECOGNIZING 40 YEARS OF METRA

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you walk around the streets of Chicago 
and ask people about how they get to and from the city--or around it--
each day, I am sure many of them would tell you: Metra. Metra 
transports us to Cubs games--in fact, its busiest ridership day was 
November 4, 2016, during the Cubs World Series victory parade--and it 
makes sure we can get to work on time. Simply put, the people of 
Chicagoland depend on Metra rail to get from point A to point B safely 
and reliably. And this year marks 40 years of Metra's service to our 
city.
  Chicago has a rich history when it comes to rail. A century ago, 
Chicago was the envy of cities across the country, with the largest 
public transportation system in the world. But by the late 1960s, the 
system was failing. To put the system back on track, in 1974, the 
Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) created the Regional Transportation 
Authority (RTA). After a decade of reorganizing, restructuring, and 
reimagining what commuter rail could look like and who should be in 
charge of operating it, in 1985, Metropolitan Rail--or Metra--was born.
  Since then, Metra has grown into a remarkable operation. With 243 
stations on 11 rail lines, Metra is the fourth busiest commuter rail 
system in the country and the largest outside of New York City. Not 
only do I represent a State that has long been the railroad center of 
the country, but working railroads is a tradition in my family. I grew 
up in East St. Louis, IL, and both of my parents worked for the New 
York Central Railroad. My two brothers and I also worked for that same 
railroad. Because of this, I care deeply about making rail travel as 
good as it can be for Illinoisans. And Metra continues to deliver. It 
emerged from the pandemic with steadily improving customer satisfaction 
that hit 92 percent in 2022. Then, in 2023, Metra opened the year by 
securing its largest ever Federal grant through the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law's Mega Program: $117 million to rebuild 11 bridges 
along its Union Pacific North Line. And by the end of last year, Metra 
had seen the largest ridership increase of any transit agency in the 
Chicago region--a 37 percent increase--providing more than 32 million 
rides.
  But Metra does more than just transport people; it responds to the 
needs of our city. Look no further than their All Stations 
Accessibility, or ``ASAP'' Program, an effort for which Metra was 
awarded more than one Federal grant to make its stations, trains, and 
platforms more accessible. While the Americans with Disabilities Act 
prohibits discrimination against Americans with disabilities and 
requires newly constructed buildings to be fully accessible, several 
legacy stations in Chicago remain inaccessible. Metra's ASAP initiative 
aims to make all stations accessible by 2038. Additionally, Metra 
ensures accessibility as it concerns affordability. In 1984, a one-way 
ticket to the farthest station cost $5.80. Today, you can travel to the 
same stations for just $6.75, which would cost $17.50 if that 1984 
price kept up with inflation.
  Metra also has made a substantial commitment to sustainability. As 
the climate crisis impacts our planet, sustainable transportation has 
been an increasing sector of interest. Metra knows this, and they will 
be among the first in the Nation to operate zero-emission train sets. 
These train sets will allow Metra to retire some of its oldest, most 
polluting diesel locomotives and reduce their carbon emissions, making 
Chicago's transportation cleaner and more reflective of the city's 
value of sustainability.
  A final example that demonstrates Metra's commitment to Chicago is

[[Page S6840]]

their proposal to reconstruct and improve the 59th-60th / University of 
Chicago Station stop. These improvements are crucial because they will 
support anticipated ridership increases to the Obama Presidential 
Library, making the space more accessible to Chicagoans and visitors.
  For so many Illinoisans, Metra is essential to getting around the 
Chicagoland area in an affordable and accessible way. Metra is public 
transportation that is just about as good as it comes. I join people 
across the Chicagoland area in thanking Metra for its 40 years of 
service to our city. Here is to many more years of safe, efficient, and 
dependable service.

           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL CLAUDIA WIGGLESWORTH

<bullet> Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, we often think of the holiday 
season as a time for giving. For LTC Claudia Wigglesworth of Daleville, 
she exhibits this spirit of generosity all year long. The daughter of 
an Army sergeant, Claudia had originally planned to become a music 
teacher. But after participating in ROTC in college, she decided she 
wanted to continue her dad's military legacy.
  Claudia used her leadership skills in several different roles within 
the military, including as a company commander in the Gulf War, at the 
Pentagon, at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, and as 
inspector general for Fort Jackson in South Carolina. She says that one 
of her most rewarding roles was serving as a recruiting battalion 
commander following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Her parting legacy was 
helping ensure that America was equipped with the manpower to defend 
itself following that day.
  Claudia retired from the military in 2005 after 23 years of service. 
She and her husband Charlie--also an Army veteran--decided to move back 
home to Daleville. Claudia began giving of her time and talents to make 
her community a better place by organizing a food drive and 
environmental projects that still take place every year. She decided to 
run for city council, before running and being elected as the mayor of 
Daleville. Claudia's leadership during her tenure as mayor proved 
instrumental in expanding Daleville's Flight School Training Support 
Services, solidifying Daleville as the home of the largest helicopter 
simulation training center in the world.
  She also volunteers countless hours with numerous regional 
organizations that help those in need in the Wiregrass and across the 
State. Claudia is the district chair for the Lions Club International 
Foundation and is a trustee for VFW Post 6020.
  Alabama is grateful for Claudia's generosity that is making our State 
a better place to call home every day. It is my honor to recognize her 
as the December Veteran of the Month.<bullet>

  HONORING THE WOMEN VETERANS OF SW MISSOURI AMERICAN LEGION POST 1214

<bullet> Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the tenth 
anniversary of the Women Veterans of Southwest Missouri American Legion 
Post 1214.
  The men and women who serve our country during war represent the 
courage, bravery, and resilience of the celebrated ``Greatest 
Generation,'' who demonstrated selflessness and diligence in the face 
of great adversity and struggle. Every citizen played their part to 
help in the war effort, whether that entailed fighting on the 
frontlines or bolstering manufacturing and domestic production. 
Everyone who stepped up to answer the call of duty deserves our honor 
and respect.
  Today, the women veterans of southwest Missouri are still committed 
to service. After valiantly serving their country, they now serve in 
their communities. Whether Active Duty or retired, these women share a 
special comradery and sisterhood that unites them. Granted a temporary 
charter in December 2014 followed by a permanent charter in November 
2015, the Women Veterans of Southwest Missouri American Legion Post 
1214 marked the first post of its kind in the southwest region of 
Missouri. The Women Veterans of Southwest Missouri American Legion Post 
1214 are faithful to the four pillars of the American Legion; they 
participate in programs to support our national security, promote 
Americanism, facilitate veterans' affairs and rehabilitation, and care 
for children and youth.
  The American Legion continues to be a cherished force of good in the 
communities they inhabit, offering familiar traditions and selfless 
service that make a positive difference in the lives of so many people. 
They embody the best of America, and I wish the members of this post 
the best as they continue to serve their communities.<bullet>

                                 ______
                                 

                         TRIBUTE TO JIM EHRLICH

<bullet> Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Jim 
Ehrlich on his retirement as executive director of the Colorado Potato 
Administrative Committee, or CPAC. Jim served in this role for nearly 
two decades. During that time, he advocated for commonsense agriculture 
policy rooted in his experience in Colorado's San Luis Valley.
  CPAC, founded in 1941, is a Federal and State Marketing Order that 
supports San Luis Valley potato growers and shippers. The organization 
has helped farmers adopt new potato varieties and, each year, ensured 
high-quality standards for more than 2 billion pounds of Colorado 
potatoes.
  Jim was born in Brighton, CO, and was raised on his grandparent's 
dairy farm after losing his mom at an early age. After serving in the 
Air Force, he moved to Colorado's San Luis Valley in 1996 to serve as 
the regional manager of the Coors Barley farm and grain elevator. He 
started at CPAC in 2006.
  Over the years, I have worked with Jim on many issues important to 
Colorado's potato growers. We ensured potatoes are classified as a 
vegetable, are available in school lunches, and can be sold throughout 
Mexico. Jim has taught me about water and drought policy as well, 
including the complicated groundwater management challenges of the San 
Luis Valley.
  Jim has also been a leader in his community beyond agriculture: He 
serves on the Rio Grande Basin Roundtable and the San Luis Valley 
Health hospital board. He is always a wise, pragmatic voice on the 
challenging issues faced by his community. Jim is direct, honest, kind, 
and humble, and I am proud to consider him a friend. On behalf of his 
family, growers and community, it is an honor to recognize and 
celebrate his work on behalf of rural Colorado.<bullet>

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       The Congress finds the following:
       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent 
     years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include 
     several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in 
     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job 
     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater 
     risk.
       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and 
     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not 
     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy 
     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while 
     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases 
     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those 
     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent 
     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.
       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently 
     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more 
     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses 
     and industries.

        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES

     SEC. 101. INCREASED WAGE PRIORITY.

       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is 
     amended--
       (1) in paragraph (4)--
       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses

       (B) in the matter preceding clause (i), as so redesignated, 
     by inserting ``(A)'' before ``Fourth'';

       (ii) by striking ``within 180 days''; and
       (iii) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the 
     debtor's business, whichever occurs first,''; and
       (D) by adding at the end the following:
       ``(B) Severance pay described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall 
     be deemed earned in full upon the layoff or termination of 
     employment of the individual to whom the severance is 
     owed.''; and
       (2) in paragraph (5)--
       (A) in subparagraph (A)--
       (i) by striking ``within 180 days''; and
       (ii) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the 
     debtor's business, whichever occurs first''; and
       (B) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the 
     following:
       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of 
     employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by 
     $20,000.''.

     SEC. 102. CLAIM FOR STOCK VALUE LOSSES IN DEFINED 
                   CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

       Section 101(5) of title 11, United States Code, is 
     amended--
       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;
       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end 
     and inserting ``; or''; and

           TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES

     SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

       Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by 
     striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the 
     following:
       ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has 
     been appointed under this chapter, other than as provided in 
     section 103(m) for collective bargaining agreements covered 
     by the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), may reject 
     a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with 
     this section. In this section, a reference to the trustee 
     includes the debtor in possession.
       ``(b) No provision of this title shall be construed to 
     permit the trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any 
     provision of a collective bargaining agreement before 
     complying with this section. The trustee shall timely pay all 
     monetary obligations arising under the terms of the 
     collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to 
     be made before a plan confirmed under section 1129 is 
     effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense 
     under section 503.
       ``(c)(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective 
     bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the 
     labor organization representing the employees covered by the 
     collective bargaining agreement that modifications are being 
     proposed under this section, and shall promptly provide an 
     initial proposal for modifications to the collective 
     bargaining agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall confer in 
     good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times 
     and for a reasonable period in light of the complexity of the 
     case, in attempting to reach mutually acceptable 
     modifications of the collective bargaining agreement.
       ``(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the 
     trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement 
     shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of 
     the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable 
     information available. The trustee shall provide to the labor 
     organization all information that is relevant for 
     negotiations. The court may enter a protective order to 
     prevent the disclosure of information if disclosure could 
     compromise the position of the debtor with respect to the 
     competitors in the industry of the debtor, subject to the 
     needs of the labor organization to evaluate the proposals of 
     the trustee and any application for rejection of the 
     collective bargaining agreement or for interim relief 
     pursuant to this section.
       ``(3) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the 
     practice and process of collective bargaining and in 
     recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, 
     modifications proposed by the trustee--

     workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the 
     reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management

     a specified aggregate financial contribution for the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement 
     (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated 
     within the 12-month period before the filing of the 
     petition), and shall be not more than the minimum savings 
     essential to

     permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation 
     of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be followed by 
     the liquidation, or the need for further financial 
     reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to the 
     debtor) in the short term; and
       ``(C) shall not be disproportionate or overly burden the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, 
     either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such 
     employees or the nature of the modifications.
       ``(d)(1) If, after a period of negotiations, the trustee 
     and the labor organization have not reached an agreement over 
     mutually satisfactory modifications, and further negotiations 
     are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory 
     modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking 
     rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice 
     and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, no such 
     hearing shall be held before the expiration of the 21-day 
     period beginning on the date on which notice of the hearing 
     is provided to the labor organization representing the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 
     Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be 
     heard at such hearing. An application for rejection shall 
     seek rejection effective upon the entry of an order granting 
     the relief.
       ``(2) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the 
     practice and process of collective bargaining and in 
     recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, the 
     court may grant a motion seeking rejection of a collective 
     bargaining agreement only if, based on clear and convincing 
     evidence--
       ``(A) the court finds that the trustee has complied with 
     the requirements of subsection (c);
       ``(B) the court has considered alternative proposals by the 
     labor organization and has concluded that such proposals do 
     not meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B);

     the proposal of the trustee or an alternative proposal by the 
     labor organization are not likely to produce an agreement;
       ``(D) the court finds that implementation of the proposal 
     of the trustee shall not--
       ``(i) cause a material diminution in the purchasing power 
     of the employees covered by the collective bargaining 
     agreement;
       ``(ii) adversely affect the ability of the debtor to retain 
     an experienced and qualified workforce; or
       ``(iii) impair the labor relations of the debtor such that 
     the ability to achieve a feasible reorganization would be 
     compromised; and
       ``(E) the court concludes that rejection of the collective 
     bargaining agreement and immediate implementation of the 
     proposal of the trustee is essential to permit the debtor to 
     exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation of a plan of 
     reorganization is not likely to be followed by liquidation, 
     or the need for further financial reorganization, of the 
     debtor (or any successor to the debtor) in the short term.
       ``(3) If, during the bankruptcy, the trustee has 
     implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses, or other 
     financial returns for an insider of the debtor, a senior 
     executive officer of the debtor, any of the 20 highest 
     compensated employees of the debtor who are not insiders or 
     senior executive officers, any department or division manager 
     of the debtor, or any consultant providing services to the 
     debtor, or such a program was implemented within 180 days 
     before the date of the filing of the petition, the court 
     shall presume that the trustee has failed to satisfy the 
     requirements of subsection (c)(3)(C).
       ``(4) In no case shall the court enter an order rejecting a 
     collective bargaining agreement that would result in 
     modifications to a level lower than the level proposed by the 
     trustee in the proposal found by the court to have complied 
     with the requirements of this section.
       ``(5) At any time after the date on which an order 
     rejecting a collective bargaining agreement is entered, or in 
     the case of a collective bargaining agreement entered into 
     between the trustee and the labor organization providing 
     mutually satisfactory modifications, at any time after that 
     collective bargaining agreement has been entered into, the 
     labor organization may apply to the court for an order 
     seeking an increase in the level of wages or benefits, or 
     relief from working conditions, based upon changed 
     circumstances. The court shall grant the request only if the 
     increase or other relief is not inconsistent with the 
     standard set forth in paragraph (2)(E).
       ``(e) During a period during which a collective bargaining 
     agreement at issue under this section continues in effect and 
     a motion for rejection of the collective bargaining agreement 
     has been filed, if essential to the continuation of the 
     business of the debtor or in order to avoid irreparable 
     damage to the estate, the court, after notice and a hearing, 
     may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the 
     terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by 
     the collective bargaining agreement. Any hearing under this 
     subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of 
     the trustee. The implementation of such interim changes shall 
     not render the application for rejection moot and may be 
     authorized for not more than 14 days in total.
       ``(f)(1) Rejection of a collective bargaining agreement 
     constitutes a breach of the collective bargaining agreement, 
     and shall be effective no earlier than the entry of an order 
     granting such relief.
       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), solely for purposes of 
     determining and allowing a claim arising from the rejection 
     of a collective bargaining agreement, rejection shall be 
     treated as rejection of an executory contract under section 
     365(g) and shall be allowed or disallowed in accordance with 
     section 502(g)(1). No claim for rejection damages shall be 
     limited by section 502(b)(7). Economic self-help by a labor 
     organization shall be permitted upon a court order granting a 
     motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement under 
     subsection (d) or pursuant to subsection (e), and no 
     provision of this title or of any other provision of Federal 
     or State law may be construed to the contrary.
       ``(g) The trustee shall provide for the reasonable fees and 
     costs incurred by a labor organization under this section, 
     upon request and after notice and a hearing.
       ``(h) A collective bargaining agreement that is assumed 
     shall be assumed in accordance with section 365.''.

     whether the debtor asserts a right to unilaterally modify 
     such payments under such plan, fund, or program'' before the 
     period at the end;

     several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in 
     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job 
     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater 
     risk.
       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and 
     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not 
     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy 
     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while 
     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases 
     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those 
     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent 
     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.
       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently 
     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more 
     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses 
     and industries.

           TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES

     SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

       Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by 
     striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the 
     following:
       ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has 
     been appointed under this chapter, other than as provided in 
     section 103(m) for collective bargaining agreements covered 
     by the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), may reject 
     a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with 
     this section. In this section, a reference to the trustee 
     includes the debtor in possession.
       ``(b) No provision of this title shall be construed to 
     permit the trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any 
     provision of a collective bargaining agreement before 
     complying with this section. The trustee shall timely pay all 
     monetary obligations arising under the terms of the 
     collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to 
     be made before a plan confirmed under section 1129 is 
     effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense 
     under section 503.
       ``(c)(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective 
     bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the 
     labor organization representing the employees covered by the 
     collective bargaining agreement that modifications are being 
     proposed under this section, and shall promptly provide an 
     initial proposal for modifications to the collective 
     bargaining agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall confer in 
     good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times 
     and for a reasonable period in light of the complexity of the 
     case, in attempting to reach mutually acceptable 
     modifications of the collective bargaining agreement.
       ``(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the 
     trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement 
     shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of 
     the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable 
     information available. The trustee shall provide to the labor 
     organization all information that is relevant for 
     negotiations. The court may enter a protective order to 
     prevent the disclosure of information if disclosure could 
     compromise the position of the debtor with respect to the 
     competitors in the industry of the debtor, subject to the 
     needs of the labor organization to evaluate the proposals of 
     the trustee and any application for rejection of the 
     collective bargaining agreement or for interim relief 
     pursuant to this section.
       ``(3) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the 
     practice and process of collective bargaining and in 
     recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, 
     modifications proposed by the trustee--
       ``(A) shall be proposed only as part of a program of 
     workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the 
     reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management 
     personnel costs;
       ``(B) shall be limited to modifications designed to achieve 
     a specified aggregate financial contribution for the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement 
     (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated 
     within the 12-month period before the filing of the 
     petition), and shall be not more than the minimum savings 
     essential to

     permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation 
     of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be followed by 
     the liquidation, or the need for further financial 
     reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to the 
     debtor) in the short term; and
       ``(C) shall not be disproportionate or overly burden the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, 
     either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such 
     employees or the nature of the modifications.
       ``(d)(1) If, after a period of negotiations, the trustee 
     and the labor organization have not reached an agreement over 
     mutually satisfactory modifications, and further negotiations 
     are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory 
     modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking 
     rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice 
     and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, no such 
     hearing shall be held before the expiration of the 21-day 
     period beginning on the date on which notice of the hearing 
     is provided to the labor organization representing the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 
     Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be 
     heard at such hearing. An application for rejection shall 
     seek rejection effective upon the entry of an order granting 
     the relief.
       ``(2) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the 
     practice and process of collective bargaining and in 
     recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the 
     employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, the 
     court may grant a motion seeking rejection of a collective 
     bargaining agreement only if, based on clear and convincing 
     evidence--
       ``(A) the court finds that the trustee has complied with 
     the requirements of subsection (c);
       ``(B) the court has considered alternative proposals by the 
     labor organization and has concluded that such proposals do 
     not meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B);
       ``(C) the court finds that further negotiations regarding 
     the proposal of the trustee or an alternative proposal by the 
     labor organization are not likely to produce an agreement;
       ``(D) the court finds that implementation of the proposal 
     of the trustee shall not--
       ``(i) cause a material diminution in the purchasing power 
     of the employees covered by the collective bargaining 
     agreement;
       ``(ii) adversely affect the ability of the debtor to retain 
     an experienced and qualified workforce; or
       ``(iii) impair the labor relations of the debtor such that 
     the ability to achieve a feasible reorganization would be 
     compromised; and
       ``(E) the court concludes that rejection of the collective 
     bargaining agreement and immediate implementation of the 
     proposal of the trustee is essential to permit the debtor to 
     exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation of a plan of 
     reorganization is not likely to be followed by liquidation, 
     or the need for further financial reorganization, of the 
     debtor (or any successor to the debtor) in the short term.
       ``(3) If, during the bankruptcy, the trustee has 
     implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses, or other 
     financial returns for an insider of the debtor, a senior 
     executive officer of the debtor, any of the 20 highest 
     compensated employees of the debtor who are not insiders or 
     senior executive officers, any department or division manager 
     of the debtor, or any consultant providing services to the 
     debtor, or such a program was implemented within 180 days 
     before the date of the filing of the petition, the court 
     shall presume that the trustee has failed to satisfy the 
     requirements of subsection (c)(3)(C).
       ``(4) In no case shall the court enter an order rejecting a 
     collective bargaining agreement that would result in 
     modifications to a level lower than the level proposed by the 
     trustee in the proposal found by the court to have complied 
     with the requirements of this section.
       ``(5) At any time after the date on which an order 
     rejecting a collective bargaining agreement is entered, or in 
     the case of a collective bargaining agreement entered into 
     between the trustee and the labor organization providing 
     mutually satisfactory modifications, at any time after that 
     collective bargaining agreement has been entered into, the 
     labor organization may apply to the court for an order 
     seeking an increase in the level of wages or benefits, or 
     relief from working conditions, based upon changed 
     circumstances. The court shall grant the request only if the 
     increase or other relief is not inconsistent with the 
     standard set forth in paragraph (2)(E).
       ``(e) During a period during which a collective bargaining 
     agreement at issue under this section continues in effect and 
     a motion for rejection of the collective bargaining agreement 
     has been filed, if essential to the continuation of the 
     business of the debtor or in order to avoid irreparable 
     damage to the estate, the court, after notice and a hearing, 
     may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the 
     terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by 
     the collective bargaining agreement. Any hearing under this 
     subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of 
     the trustee. The implementation of such interim changes shall 
     not render the application for rejection moot and may be 
     authorized for not more than 14 days in total.
       ``(f)(1) Rejection of a collective bargaining agreement 
     constitutes a breach of the collective bargaining agreement, 
     and shall be effective no earlier than the entry of an order 
     granting such relief.
       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), solely for purposes of 
     determining and allowing a claim arising from the rejection 
     of a collective bargaining agreement, rejection shall be 
     treated as rejection of an executory contract under section 
     365(g) and shall be allowed or disallowed in accordance with 
     section 502(g)(1). No claim for rejection damages shall be 
     limited by section 502(b)(7). Economic self-help by a labor 
     organization shall be permitted upon a court order granting a 
     motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement under 
     subsection (d) or pursuant to subsection (e), and no 
     provision of this title or of any other provision of Federal 
     or State law may be construed to the contrary.
       ``(g) The trustee shall provide for the reasonable fees and 
     costs incurred by a labor organization under this section, 
     upon request and after notice and a hearing.
       ``(h) A collective bargaining agreement that is assumed 
     shall be assumed in accordance with section 365.''.

     SEC. 202. PAYMENT OF INSURANCE BENEFITS TO RETIRED EMPLOYEES.

       Section 1114 of title 11, United States Code, is amended--
       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, without regard to 
     whether the debtor asserts a right to unilaterally modify 
     such payments under such plan, fund, or program'' before the 
     period at the end;
       (2) in subsection (b)(2), by inserting ``, and a labor 
     organization serving as the authorized representative under 
     subsection (c)(1),'' after ``section'';

     benefits, the trustee shall provide a notice to the 
     authorized representative that modifications are being

     every economic sector in the United States, throughout all 50 
     States and the territories of the United States, and in every 
     congressional district in the United States;
       Whereas cooperatives help farmers increase incomes and 
     become more resilient to economic business cycles by working 
     together to plan and prepare for the future, while 
     contributing significantly to the economic activity in the 
     agriculture and food markets of the United States;
       Whereas the roughly 1,700 agricultural cooperatives in the 
     United States operate more than 9,500 facilities, employ a 
     record $111,000,000,000 in assets, and generate more than 
     $231,400,000,000 in business;
       Whereas the majority of the 2,000,000 farmers in the United 
     States belong to an agricultural cooperative;
       Whereas agricultural cooperatives offer members the 
     opportunity to access commodity value-added profits 
     throughout the handling, processing, and distribution chains;
       Whereas member-owners in agricultural cooperatives are 
     dedicated to providing the highest quality product for 
     consumers;
       Whereas agricultural cooperatives add significant benefits 
     to the economic well-being of rural areas of the United 
     States by providing more than 250,000 jobs with annual wages 
     totaling more than $11,000,000,000;
       Whereas agricultural cooperatives provide resources to 
     their member-owners, such as low-cost supplies, effective 
     marketing, and services;
       Whereas farmer members in agricultural cooperatives have 
     the opportunity to pool resources and reinvest profits into 
     the communities of the farmer members;
       Whereas the principles of cooperation and the cooperative 
     business model help smallholder farmers organize themselves 
     and gain access to local and global markets, training, 
     improved inputs, conservation programs, and aggregated sales 
     and marketing;
       Whereas the cooperative business model provides farmers 
     ownership over their economic decisions, a focus on learning, 
     and a broader understanding of environmental and social 
     concerns;
       Whereas the cooperative business model has been used 
     throughout the history of the United States to advance civil 
     rights and to help ensure that all people have equal access 
     to economic opportunity;
       Whereas cooperative values promote self-determination and 
     democratic rights for all people;
       Whereas the comprehensive global food security strategy 
     established under section 5 of the Global Food Security Act 
     of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 9304) (commonly known as ``Feed the 
     Future'') and the Cooperative Development Program of the 
     United States Agency for International Development use 
     cooperative principles and the cooperative business model to 
     advance international development, nutrition, resilience, and 
     economic security;
       Whereas the Interagency Working Group on Cooperative 
     Development--
       (1) is an interagency group that is coordinated and chaired 
     by the Secretary of Agriculture to foster cooperative 
     development and ensure coordination with Federal agencies and 
     national and local cooperative organizations that have 
     cooperative programs and interests; and
       (2) as of the date of introduction of this resolution, has 
     organized 11 meetings;
       Whereas the bipartisan Congressional Cooperative Business 
     Caucus unites Members of Congress to--
       (1) create a better-informed electorate and a more educated 
     public on the important role that cooperatives play in the 
     economy of the United States and the world;
       (2) promote the cooperative business model because that 
     model ensures that consumers have access to high-quality 
     goods and services at competitive prices and costs that 
     improve the lives of individuals, families, and their 
     communities; and
       (3) address and correct awareness challenges among the 
     public and within the Federal Government relating to what 
     cooperatives look like, who participates in cooperatives, 
     where cooperatives are located, and why individuals choose 
     cooperatives;
       Whereas the Bureau of the Census, as part of the 2017 and 
     2022 Economic Censuses, asked each business if the business 
     was organized as a cooperative, and the responses of 
     businesses yielded both quantitative and qualitative data on 
     the effects and importance of cooperatives across the economy 
     of the United States;
       Whereas, throughout the rural United States, many utility 
     service providers operate as cooperatives and are tasked with 
     the delivery of public services, such as electricity, water, 
     telecommunications, and broadband, in areas where investor-
     owned utility companies typically do not operate;
       Whereas utility cooperatives have innovated to meet the 
     evolving needs of their member-owners, create more resilient 
     communities, and help rural individuals in the United States 
     prosper;
       Whereas electric cooperatives serve 56 percent of the 
     landmass of the United States, including 92 percent of 
     persistent poverty counties, and energy cooperatives power 
     more than 21,500,000 homes, businesses, and schools;
       Whereas there are approximately 260 telephone cooperatives 
     in the United States with total annual revenues of 
     $3,900,000,000;
       Whereas, in the financial services sector, cooperatives, 
     including credit unions, farm credit banks, and other 
     financing organizations that lend to cooperatives, provide 
     numerous benefits to the member-owners of those cooperatives;
       Whereas, nationally, approximately 4,800 credit unions 
     serve 138,000,000 members;
       Whereas member-owners of cooperatives vote in board 
     elections, and earned profits cycle back into cost-saving 
     programs or return as dividend payments;
       Whereas purchasing and shared service cooperatives allow 
     independent and franchise businesses to thrive;
       Whereas food cooperatives range in size from small, local 
     institutions to multi-store regional giants that compete with 
     chain stores with locations across the United States;
       Whereas food cooperatives support local producers in all 50 
     States and reduce food insecurity;
       Whereas, in the housing sector, housing cooperatives and 
     resident-owned communities in which members own the building 
     or land--

[[Page S6850]]

       (1) are an alternative to conventional rental apartments, 
     manufactured home parks, and condominiums; and
       (2) empower each resident with ownership and 
     responsibility;
       Whereas housing cooperatives have roots dating to the late 
     1800s and are increasingly becoming a housing alternative for 
     students at colleges throughout the United States;
       Whereas shared equity housing cooperatives are a strategy 
     for preserving long-term, affordable housing;
       Whereas cooperatives allow residents of manufactured home 
     communities to collectively purchase the land on which they 
     live, providing stability and the opportunity to self-govern;
       Whereas, as of 2023, 309 manufactured home communities are 
     cooperatively owned;
       Whereas the growth of worker cooperatives in the United 
     States is allowing more workers to own and have greater 
     control over their businesses;
       Whereas many small businesses convert to cooperatives when 
     faced with closure or a buyout, ensuring that such a business 
     can continue to serve its community; and
       Whereas the cooperative business model allows business 
     owners to retire and transfer business ownership to employees 
     or consumers, protecting local ownership and supporting local 
     communities: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) expresses support for the designation of October 2024 
     as ``National Co-Op Month'';
       (2) commends the cooperative business model for--
       (A) its contributions to the economy of the United States;
       (B) the jobs it creates; and
       (C) its positive impacts on local communities;
       (3) expresses confidence in, and support for, cooperatives 
     to continue their successes; and
       (4) will be mindful in crafting legislation that affects 
     business models that are not the cooperative business model 
     so that the legislation does not adversely affect the 
     cooperative business model.

  SA 3312. Mr. WYDEN proposed an amendment to the resolution S. Res. 
74, condemning the Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of 
the Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International 
Covenants on Human Rights; as follows:

       Strike the preamble and insert the following:
       Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 
     2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 
     2018, 2020, and 2022, Congress declared that it deplored the 
     religious persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i 
     community and would hold the Government of Iran responsible 
     for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including 
     members of the Baha'i faith;
       Whereas, since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or 
     executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and more than 10,000 
     Baha'is have been dismissed from government and university 
     jobs;
       Whereas June 18, 2023, marked the 40th anniversary of the 
     execution of 10 Baha'i women by the Government of Iran, each 
     witnessing the hanging of those hanged before her in a final 
     failed attempt to induce abandonment of their faith after 
     over 6 months of imprisonment and violent abuse, with the 
     youngest only 17 years old;
       Whereas, on December 19, 2023, the United Nations General 
     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/C.3/78/L.41) calling on Iran 
     to carry out wide-ranging reforms and expressing serious 
     concerns for its escalating human rights abuses, including--
       (1) ``severe limitations and increasing restrictions on the 
     right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or 
     belief'';
       (2) ``restrictions on the establishment of places of 
     worship, undue restrictions on burials carried out in 
     accordance with religious tenets, attacks against places of 
     worship and burial'';
       (3) ``increased harassment, intimidation, persecution, 
     arbitrary arrest, and detention of, and incitement to hatred 
     that leads to violence against, persons belonging to 
     recognized and unrecognized religious minorities, including 
     Christians (particularly converts from Islam), Gonabadi 
     Dervishes, Jews, Sufi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Yarsanis, 
     Zoroastrians, and in particular, Baha'is'';
       (4) ``denial of and restrictions on access to education, 
     including for members of the Baha'i faith''; and
       (5) ``particular'' persecution of members of the Baha'i 
     community ``who have been subjected to a continued increase 
     in persecution, including attacks, harassment and targeting. 
     . .on account of their faith and have been reportedly 
     subjected to mass arrests and lengthy prison sentences, as 
     well as the arrest of prominent members and increased 
     confiscation and destruction of property'';
       Whereas, in the 2024 Annual Report of the United States 
     Commission on International Religious Freedom issued in May 
     2024, it is reported that in 2023--
       (1) the Government of Iran ``conducted individual and mass 
     arrests of Baha'is across Iran taking them to undisclosed 
     locations and imposing excessively long prison sentences'';
       (2) ``security officials beat and brutalized Baha'is during 
     raids and searches of private homes'';
       (3) ``security forces arrested scores of Baha'is in cities 
     including Hamadan, Mehrshahr, Yazd, Karaj, Alborz, and 
     Tehran'';
       (4) the ``government has targeted Baha'i women in 
     particular'' and that ``[a]pproximately two-thirds of Iranian 
     Baha'i prisoners are women'';
       (5) authorities ``targeted Baha'i cemeteries in Arak, 
     Alborz, and Golestan''; and
       (6) local ``municipalities seized and confiscated Baha'i 
     land, restricted Baha'i access to burial grounds, and 
     declared intentions to sell Baha'i-owned property exclusively 
     to Muslims.'';
       Whereas the Iran section of the Department of State's 2022 
     Report on International Religious Freedom issued in May 2023 
     provides, in part--
       (1) ``[I]n July and August, security forces in cities 
     across the country conducted multiple raids of Baha'i homes, 
     confiscated property deemed `illegitimate wealth', and 
     arrested Baha'is in their homes or workplaces on 
     unsubstantiated charges including `causing intellectual and 
     ideological insecurity in Muslim society.' '';
       (2) ``Authorities reportedly continued to deny members of 
     unrecognized religious minority groups access to education 
     and government employment unless they declared themselves as 
     belonging to one of the country's recognized religions on 
     their application forms. UN experts reported universities 
     rejected more than 90 Baha'i students between January and 
     August.''; and
       (3) ``Government officials and government-affiliated 
     organizations continued to disseminate anti-Baha'i and 
     antisemitic messages using traditional and social media.'';
       Whereas, in response to a surge in persecution in June and 
     July 2022, involving the subjection of over 100 Baha'is to 
     arrests, arraignments, sentencing, and raids on their homes 
     and businesses across Iran, including the sentencing in June 
     of 26 individuals in the city of Shiraz to a combined total 
     of 85 years in prison, the Department of State's Office of 
     International Religious Freedom issued a statement on August 
     2, 2022, indicating that ``[a]mid a continued rise in 
     arrests, sentences, and imprisonments, the U.S. urges Iran to 
     halt its ongoing oppression of the Baha'i community and honor 
     its international obligations to respect the right of all 
     Iranians to freedom of religion or belief'';
       Whereas, on November 21, 2022, Mahvash Sabet and Fariba 
     Kamalabadi, 2 former members of the informal 7-person 
     leadership group of the Baha'is of Iran, who each served 10-
     year sentences from 2008 to 2018, and have been detained 
     since July 31, 2022, in Evin prison, were sentenced to 10 
     years in prison each after a summary trial lasting 1 hour;
       Whereas, on December 11, 2022, the Baha'i International 
     Community organization stated that ``Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the 
     Nobel laureate and defence lawyer for Mahvash and Fariba 
     during their first trial, said in 2008 that `not a shred of 
     evidence' was offered to prove the national security charges 
     or other allegations. Nor was any new evidence forthcoming at 
     this latest trial'';
       Whereas, on January 12, 2024, the Baha'i International 
     Community organization reported increasing incidents of 
     persecution accompanied by intensified violence perpetrated 
     against the Baha'i community by the Government of Iran, for 
     example--
       (1) ``since the beginning of October [2023] more than 200 
     incidents of persecution, including over 50 arrests and 
     imprisonments, have occurred in various cities such as 
     Shiraz, Yazd, Isfahan, Hamadan, and Karaj'';
       (2) government agents have perpetrated ``increasingly 
     violent home raids, disproportionately affecting women and 
     the elderly, and have even resulted in hospitalizations and 
     traumatic separations of mothers from their children. 
     Notably, over two-thirds of those arrested and detained have 
     been women, predominantly in their twenties and thirties, 
     highlighting the escalation of attacks against women in 
     recent months.''; and
       (3) government agents have instigated a ``conspicuous rise 
     in hate speech, where Baha'is have been accused of being 
     behind the September 2022 protests, promoting permissiveness, 
     being against Islam and Shiism, being spies for Israel and 
     the West, and being part of a political movement that seeks 
     to undermine the state'';
       Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a 
     signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
     and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
     among other international human rights treaties, without 
     reservation;
       Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) 
     authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals 
     who are ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for 
     ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission 
     of serious human rights abuses against citizens of

[[Page S6851]]

     Iran or their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and
       Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights 
     Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the 
     authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran 
     Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public 
     Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now, 
     therefore, be it

     Nobel laureate and defence lawyer for Mahvash and Fariba 
     during their first trial, said in 2008 that `not a shred of 
     evidence' was offered to prove the national security charges 
     or other allegations. Nor was any new evidence forthcoming at 
     this latest trial'';
       Whereas, on January 12, 2024, the Baha'i International 
     Community organization reported increasing incidents of 
     persecution accompanied by intensified violence perpetrated 
     against the Baha'i community by the Government of Iran, for 
     example--
       (1) ``since the beginning of October [2023] more than 200 
     incidents of persecution, including over 50 arrests and 
     imprisonments, have occurred in various cities such as 
     Shiraz, Yazd, Isfahan, Hamadan, and Karaj'';
       (2) government agents have perpetrated ``increasingly 
     violent home raids, disproportionately affecting women and 
     the elderly, and have even resulted in hospitalizations and 
     traumatic separations of mothers from their children. 
     Notably, over two-thirds of those arrested and detained have 
     been women, predominantly in their twenties and thirties, 
     highlighting the escalation of attacks against women in 
     recent months.''; and
       (3) government agents have instigated a ``conspicuous rise 
     in hate speech, where Baha'is have been accused of being 
     behind the September 2022 protests, promoting permissiveness, 
     being against Islam and Shiism, being spies for Israel and 
     the West, and being part of a political movement that seeks 
     to undermine the state'';
       Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a 
     signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
     and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
     among other international human rights treaties, without 
     reservation;
       Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) 
     authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals 
     who are ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for 
     ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission 
     of serious human rights abuses against citizens of

     Iran or their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and
       Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights 
     Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the 
     authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran 
     Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public 
     Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now, 
     therefore, be it
                                 ______
                                 
  SA 3313. Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for Mrs. Blackburn) proposed an amendment to 
the bill S. 4212, to amend the Visit America Act to promote music 
tourism, and for other purposes; as follows:

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past January it was my pleasure to 
attend the Middle Township Ambulance Corps Installation of Officers 
Dinner in Cape May Court House, South Jersey. During this dinner we 
recognized members for their outstanding achievements, honored those 
who displayed exceptional bravery during the pandemic, and celebrated 
the installation of these officers. It was my honor to celebrate the 
following new officers as they took their oath of office: Deborah A. 
Rue as President, Theodore Bohn as Vice President, Deborah Brannon as 
Treasurer, Julie Mounts as Secretary, Joseph F. Eagan, IV as Chief, 
Gary Seabridge, Jr. as Assistant Chief, Brian Mounts as Captain, 
Zachary Lex as First Lieutenant, Andrew Raniszewski as Second 
Lieutenant, and Charles Roach Third Lieutenant. Middle Township 
Ambulance Corps, Inc. is the sole volunteer ambulance corps in Middle 
Township, covering over 89 square miles. Our South Jersey community 
feels safer knowing this group of amazing people will always be there 
to answer their call. I want to thank them for their unwavering 
dedication and their invaluable contributions to our community. God 
Bless Middle Township Ambulance Corps and God Bless the United States 
of America.

 RECOGNIZING CHAIRMAN KEITH ANDERSON OF THE SHAKOPEE MDEWAKANTON SIOUX 
                               COMMUNITY

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate outgoing 
Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) Chairman Keith Anderson on 
a successful four years as Chairman of SMSC's Business Council.
  Chairman Anderson served for five terms on SMSC's Business Council. 
I'm thankful for our strong working relationship during his time as 
Chairman and it is a privilege to represent the Shakopee Mdewakanton 
Sioux Community in Congress. In particular, I'm proud to have secured 
$2.5 million in federal funding to help complete a clean water 
reclamation system at SMSC's new organics recycling facility, Dakota 
Prairie Composting.
  Chairman Anderson continued SMSC's strong national presence having 
served as co-chairman of the Native Farm Bill Coalition, advocating for 
native farming practices and serving as board chairman for Koda Energy, 
a partnership between Rahr Malting and SMSC that creates energy by 
burning dry biomass fuels. As a member of the Business Council, he also 
helped oversee the construction and opening of Hocokata Ti, SMSC's 
cultural center and museum. I'm grateful for our partnership and wish 
Chairman Anderson the best.

        TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WORKERS ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 31, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7024, the Tax 
Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
  Let's be clear about what this tax deal is: just another Republican 
handout to big corporations and oil companies. Congressional 
Republicans are claiming victory with this bill, touting the $600 
billion in tax cuts for corporations if the corporate tax cuts in this 
bill are made permanent.
  The 2017 Trrump-GOP tax scam has added $1.9 trillion to the deficit. 
Republicans voted to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for their 
deficit-exploding giveaway to big corporations and billionaires. Thanks 
to the Trump-GOP tax scam, big corporations and oil companies have 
enjoyed lower taxes and have taken advantage of tax credits. Big 
corporations like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Marathon Petroleum 
already pay far too little in taxes each year. H.R. 7024 would give 
them access to even more tax cuts. Congress should be ensuring big 
corporations and oil companies pay their fair share rather than helping 
them get a leg up.
  I support the Child Tax Credit and voted for it in the American 
Rescue Plan, but H.R. 7024 is eighty-two pages long and only three 
pages pertain to the credit. In those three pages, the Child Tax Credit 
provisions fail to replicate the success of the improved Child Tax 
Credit provided to families by the American Rescue Plan. Under H.R. 
7024, fewer families will be eligible, and the credit will be received 
as an annual refund. We heard from families who said the monthly 
payments are what made this credit so helpful to them in 2021 to pay 
their monthly bills, keep healthy and nutritious food on the table, and 
manage a mortgage or rent. I look forward to working with NETWORK, Save 
the Children, the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, and other advocacy 
groups to put forward a tax bill that accomplishes all our goals with 
the Child Tax Credit.
  I strongly opposed the Trump-GOP tax scam when it was rushed through 
Congress in 2017. Donald Trump and the GOP promised increased tax 
revenues to offset the massive debt they created, but it never 
materialized. Instead, the tax scam ballooned the deficit. I've been 
outspoken in the past about how harmful those tax cuts were, and I 
believe H.R. 7024 is another Republican scam to give big corporations a 
break while the rest of America picks up the tab. I urge my colleagues 
to reject H.R. 7024.

                          ____________________

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past January, it was my honor to 
attend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor for an incredible young man, 
Hayden Thom. Hayden has been involved with the Scouts since the second 
grade and has been a very active member in the years since. Throughout 
his journey, he has held several leadership positions, earned thirty 
merit badges, and completed almost 200 hours of community service. His 
trail to Eagle Scout culminated with his Eagle Scout project where he 
helped design and install a new display for a World War II Anti-Tank 
Gun for American Legion Post 452 in Mullica Hill, South Jersey. This 
display included a new concrete pad, lighting, new flag poles, 
protective bollards for the gun, and decorative stone. He hopes to stay 
involved with the troops and give back by volunteering with his scout 
troop as an adult leader. In June of 2026, Hayden will graduate from 
Gloucester County Institute of Technology and plans to attend the 
Universal Technical Institute to further study the automotive industry. 
I know this young man will do big things, and I am incredibly proud of 
him for this accomplishment. God bless Hayden and God bless the United 
States of America.

         RECOGNIZING AMANDA ARCHER OF CANTON CITY PUBLIC HEALTH

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Amanda Archer from 
Canton as the Ohio-13 Champion of the Week. Amanda is the first woman 
to lead Canton City Public Health as Health Commissioner in its 175-
year history. In addition to working for the health department since 
2014, she also worked as an epidemiologist in the Stark County 
Coroner's Office as an epidemiologist to inform decisions and policies 
to help prevent disease in the community.
  This experience made her an easy fit as the lead epidemiologist for 
Canton's COVID-19 response in 2020, helping Canton residents understand 
critical information about the virus. Amanda has dedicated herself to 
the health and wellbeing of her community, and I am excited to see how 
she leads Canton City Public Health in her new role.

  Congratulations once more to the Ohio-13 Champion of the Week, Amanda 
Archer.

            RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ANEELAH AFZALI

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Aneelah 
Afzali, who is stepping down after over seven years of service as the 
Executive Director of the American Muslim Empowerment Network of the 
Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS-AMEN).
  Aneelah founded MAPS-AMEN in December 2016 to combat rising 
islamophobia and empower the Pacific Northwest Muslim American 
community. I was proud to bring Aneelah as my guest to the 2017 State 
of the Union Address during my first year in Congress. Her story as a 
Muslim American woman of color is truly the American story. Aneelah's 
presence demonstrated to President Trump that he could not silence the 
patriotism and resolve of people in this country based on their race, 
religion or country of origin. Her continued organizing over the next 
seven years impacted the lives of thousands and exemplified her 
commitment to the realization of a just world.
  Throughout her career, Aneelah's work with faith and non-faith 
communities has built bridges across religious, racial, cultural and 
political divides. Aneelah currently serves on a number of governing 
and advisory boards. Through this service, she emphasizes 
intersectionality and equity within the contexts of a wide array of 
issues such as gun violence prevention, racial justice, immigration 
reform and educational equity. She also continues to work with the 
Washington State Refugee Coordinator to welcome and resettle of Afghan 
refugees. She is a true community activist, interfaith leader, and 
civil rights advocate.
  Aneelah's particular combination of brilliance, commitment to 
organizing and community, tenacity and strategic ability has been a 
true gift to our region and our people. She has inspired and celebrated 
the leadership of countless others, and of regular community members 
taking action and recognizing the power of their voices. Her integrity 
and values underlie everything, and she has never wavered from those no 
matter how challenging the situation. I have been continually inspired 
by Aneelah's work to combat hate and create a more equitable society.
  As she continues her work to empower communities in new ways, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in celebrating Aneelah's many accomplishments 
and contributions to our country. On behalf of Washington's 7th 
Congressional District, I thank Aneelah for her partnership, service to 
the people of the Pacific Northwest and dedication to the fight for 
justice.

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past December, I had the honor of 
celebrating Harvey and Madalyn Rovinsky and their retirement after 
almost 60 years in the jewelry business. Through their hard work and 
dedication over the years, Harvey and Madalyn have cemented their names 
in the luxury jewelry industry. Harvey joined the jewelry business at a 
young age, working with his father as a watchmaker. In 1966, he joined 
Bernie Robbins Jewelers, working for his future parents-in-law. He 
learned vital business lessons from Bernie, emphasizing credibility and 
customer relationships. In 1992, Harvey and Madalyn transformed the 
company, creating an exquisite jewelry destination that now has three 
locations spread over Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Under their 
leadership, Bernie Robbins has become a highly decorated business, 
receiving countless recognitions and awards. In 2022, they received the 
National Jeweler Retailer Hall of Fame Award and Bernie Robbins 
Jewelers was recognized as a New Jersey Top Workplace for employee 
engagement. Because of their hard work, Bernie Robbins has become 
synonymous with expertise and exceptional customer experiences in a 
welcoming atmosphere. I hope Harvey and Madalyn enjoy their retirement, 
and I know their legacy will continue to shine brightly for years to 
come. God Bless Harvey and Madalyn and God Bless the United States of 
America.

                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR TONY JUNIOUS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a trailblazing 
public servant and pillar in the Summerton, South Carolina, community. 
Mayor Tony Junious tragically passed away on January 27, 2024. He was 
loved by everybody who knew him and will be sorely missed.
  Born and raised in Summerton, Tony embodied the spirit of the town. 
Attending Clarendon County schools, he had an insatiable desire to 
learn and graduated from Scott's Branch High School as class President 
in 1995. Though Tony became a successful entrepreneur, it was his 
passion for education that led him to public service. The community 
elected him to serve on various Clarendon County School District Boards 
of Trustees. During his tenure, Tony increased high school graduation 
rates, began career readiness programs, volunteered at school events, 
mentored young leaders, and organized scholarship dinners for Scott's 
Branch High School Seniors. He was especially committed to younger 
students and ensuring they had a strong foundation to prepare them for 
the future.
  After spending two decades advocating on behalf of Summerton's 
children, Tony ran for Mayor of Summerton with a bold vision of moving 
the town forward bolstering economic development, improving the water 
system, and bringing more healthcare options to the area. On April 5, 
2022, Tony was elected the first Black Mayor of Summerton. In his first 
year, Mayor Junious achieved significant milestones; securing a $25,000 
Hometown Grant, securing $12 million in infrastructure grants, 
initiating a Hood zone study, participating in the Broadband Internet 
Access Survey, establishing a Community Clean-Up Group, and passing an 
ordinance on firearms safety.
  While Mayor Junious had big visions for Summerton, he had an even 
bigger heart. He had a gift for making every person in the town feel 
they belonged and that their voice was heard. With an infectious smile 
and a heart of gold, he emanated a sense of pride for Summerton that 
rippled through the entire community. Even during difficult times, his 
warm presence and astute leadership reassured everyone that no 
challenge was too big to overcome. Whenever Mayor Junious set his mind 
to something, rest assured he would achieve it.
  A man of deep faith, Tony attended various churches throughout his 
life and was ordained an Elder and Minister. He recently received his 
Doctorate under the leadership of Apostle Elizabeth Gipson at the Open 
House of Prayer Healing and Deliverance Ministries, where he served as 
Chair of the Pastor aide committee.
  Left to cherish Tony's memory is his loving wife, LaShenda Miller 
Junious, his mother, stepmother, grandmother, four sons, three 
daughters, stepdaughter, adopted daughter, grandchildren, brothers, 
sisters, and many more.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing 
the life of Mayor Tony Junious. In his honor, the people of Summerton 
have committed to moving forward with the vision Mayor Junious put in 
motion, a testament to the enduring impact of his legacy that will 
resonate for many years to come.

Cool) from Jackson Memorial Middle School in Massillon as the Ohio-13

          HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MRS. BEULAH JACKSON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PATRICK RYAN

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and legacy of an 
impactful community leader, Mrs. Beulah Jackson.
  As a life-long New York resident, Mrs. Jackson spent her life leading 
her community of Beacon where she resided for 75 years. She worked 
alongside politicians and organizations to promote an inclusive and 
equitable community for those around her.
  Her advocacy roles have included being a civic leader of the African 
American community and a long-time member of the NAACP. She was 
inspired by the Civil Rights movement recognized leaders such as Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev. Jesse Jackson. With such significant 
role models, Mrs. Jackson worked alongside contemporaries such as Mayor 
Clara Lou Gould, Peter Seeger, and Rev. Barbara Baker to promote 
critical relationships between community members and their leaders 
throughout Dutchess County and the larger New York State.
  Mrs. Jackson's legacy has truly made a mark on her local and larger 
communities. Her incredible dedication to various programs created for 
uplifting communities, specifically in Poughkeepsie and Beacon, has 
always been inspiring to those around her and for years to come.
  As the first African-American bookkeeper in Poughkeepsie and the 
first African-American Director of the Anti-Poverty Program in Beacon, 
Mrs. Jackson was a trailblazer who should be honored for her service. 
Even her work with scholarship programs at the local schools or in 
youth clubs, she has touched the lives of the young and the old, truly 
contributing to the social fabric for the county.
  I am truly honored to say that the district I represent had such a 
strong leader to show all of us the importance of service and community 
engagement. Her leadership will remain admirable as I hope we all can 
learn from the accomplishments of this amazing woman.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, we come together with heavy hearts to 
honor the life and legacy of former Mayor Aldo Palombo, a passionate 
and caring man who dedicated his life to service. Mayor Palombo served 
as the 15th Mayor of North Wildwood from 1994 to 2005 and in his 
capacity as mayor, completely turned the city around. What was once a 
run-down city was transformed into a desirable family destination under 
his leadership. Mayor Palombo was a beacon of optimism and boundless 
energy during these trying times. His leadership breathed new life into 
the city of North Wildwood at the time it needed it most. He was a 
tireless ambassador for North Wildwood, always eager to promote the 
community and his efforts and commitment left an indelible mark on the 
city. As we bid farewell to Mayor Aldo Palombo, I extend my deepest 
condolences to the entire Palombo Family. His memory will live on for 
generations to come in the city that he cared for so deeply and helped 
shape. We are forever grateful for his dedication, optimism, and 
enduring impact on North Wildwood. May he rest in peace.

HONORING CALEIGH GUMBINER'S SERVICE AS DIRECTOR OF CONSTITUENT SERVICES

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate 
Caleigh Gumbiner for five years and more than two full sessions of 
Congress as a member of my district office staff.
  Caleigh has been with my office from the very beginning. They started 
our casework operation in 2019 with virtually no resources and have 
elevated to the role of Director of Constituent Services. For years, 
Caleigh has worked tirelessly to serve the constituents of Minnesota's 
Second District.
  They've overseen the building up and training of a constituent 
services team that has returned more than $4.5 million to constituents 
and closed over 4,200 cases. Caleigh's been vital to training other 
congressional offices having worked with the CAO Coach program. They 
led our district office team through the pandemic and all the various 
programs Congress passed to serve our constituents and have worked day 
and night during global conflicts to ensure constituents' safety.
  I'll always be grateful for Caleigh's service to my team and our 
constituents in their various roles over the years and wish them the 
best in their new role with Second Harvest Heartland--I'm confident 
they'll continue to serve Minnesotans with exceptional service.

                          ____________________

                      HONORING BLACK HISTORY MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. FRANK J. MRVAN

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and sincere 
admiration that I rise today to celebrate Black History Month and its 
2024 theme--African Americans and the Arts. This year's theme reflects 
on the important work of African American artists throughout the 
country who preserve history, enrich communities, and create 
empowerment through the visual and performing arts including 
literature, film, music, fashion, culinary, architecture, and more.
  History has shown that the artistic contributions of African 
Americans have been minimized, excluded, and even denied. African 
American artistic movements such as the Black Renaissance, the Black 
Art Movement, and the introduction of the Hip-Hop music genre, to name 
a few, have been crucial in bringing about change, equality, and social 
justice to the African American community in the United States and all 
over the world.
  Throughout the years, Northwest Indiana has been home to many 
successful and noteworthy art-based organizations and programs that are 
truly inspiring. I would like to take a moment to recognize a few of 
them, past and present, including Vee-Jay Records, West Side Theater 
Guild, Gary International Black Film Festival, Gary Theatre Ensemble, 
Marshall J. Gardener Center for the Arts, Glen Theatre, the Gary Public 
Murals and Statues Program, the Miller Beach Arts and Creative 
District, and the Gary Public Art Competition, among others. For their 
unwavering dedication to preserving and honoring African Americans and 
the arts, each organization, program, and its members are worthy of the 
very highest praise.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues 
join me in celebrating Black History Month and honoring the countless 
African Americans who have played such a critical role in enriching our 
culture through the arts. Let us commend each of them for their 
profound passion, creativity, and perseverance as they have enhanced 
the quality of life for all Americans.

                          ____________________

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past January, I had the honor of 
celebrating Ryan Simpkins and his achievement of the rank of Eagle 
Scout, the highest honor in the Boy Scouts of America. During his time 
in the Scouts, Ryan has learned valuable lessons in leadership, 
friendship, and service and will carry these lessons with him for the 
rest of his life. For Ryan's Eagle Scout project, he assembled ``Little 
Libraries'', which are a free book exchange where people can take a 
book or share a book. His noble goal was to encourage literacy in his 
home area of Hopewell South Jersey and Bridgeton South Jersey. The 
Scouting experience has left an indelible mark on Ryan, and he will 
continue his scouting experience as an adult leader in scouting later 
in life. Congratulations to Ryan on achieving this milestone, and I 
wish him all the best. God Bless Ryan and God Bless the United States 
of America.

                    IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL JOSEPH REED

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr Speaker, I rise today in sadness and in joy 
to celebrate the life of a good man and a friend of longstanding, Mr. 
Michael Joseph Reed. Sadly, Michael transitioned from labor to reward 
on January 15, 2024, at the age of 69. A private service will be held 
on Friday, February 2, 2024, among family, friends, and loved ones. 
While his passing leaves in its wake many heavy hearts, upon prayerful 
reflection, the pain we share must melt into joy. For Michael

[[Page E108]]

Reed leaves a remarkable legacy of service to humanity as a public 
servant, mentor, confidant, husband, and friend to many.
  A native of Buffalo, New York, Michael earned his bachelor's degree 
in Business Administration from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama. 
He also earned a master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from 
Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.
  Michael's career in public service began as a Presidential Management 
Intern at the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Budget 
Policy. This experience led him to his first Capitol Hill position as 
an intern for former Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, who was a member 
of the House Appropriations Committee. After leaving Congressman 
Stokes, he joined the staff of Congressman William Gray, Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee and a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, as Legislative Director. After leaving Congressman Gray's 
office, he was Vice-President for Marketing at the United Negro College 
Fund. He was also the Director of Regional Card Marketing and Vice-
President for Government Affairs for the American Express Company.
  When I was selected to serve on the House Appropriations Committee in 
2003, I needed a seasoned specialist and adviser. I was blessed to have 
Michael Reed join my team--starting as a Policy Adviser and Special 
Assistant, later becoming my Deputy Chief of Staff, and finally my 
Chief of Staff where he served until his Capitol Hill retirement in 
2021.
  For 18 years I matriculated in the ``Michael Reed School of Budgetary 
Policy''. He was a master of the appropriations process and its 
nuances. He was also constantly growing and expanding his expertise. 
Initially unfamiliar with agriculture issues, he quickly became steeped 
in the knowledge of the field. He was an invaluable asset to me and was 
respected by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
  It was no surprise that upon leaving Capitol Hill, Michael was 
honored by the communities and industries whose lives his work touched, 
most notably the University of Georgia (UGA) and the Georgia Peanut 
Commission. UGA's College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences 
bestowed its Medallion of Honor on Michael in 2021. This award 
recognizes outstanding individuals for their dedication to the 
college's mission and is an expression of the University's gratitude 
for the time, advice, support and impact awardees have provided. The 
Georgia Peanut Commission presented Michael with its Distinguished 
Service Award in 2022, which is a testament to the decades of work 
Michael Reed did to help protect our peanut farmers and grow the peanut 
industry.
  Upon his retirement from the public sector, Michael decided to re-
enter the private sector and utilize his extraordinary skills and 
talents to make a meaningful contribution to mankind's efforts to 
confront the challenges of the environment and climate change. In 2021, 
he joined the American Forest Foundation as Vice President of Policy, 
exploring the pivotal role our nation's forests play and the potential 
they have in meeting this global challenge.
  Sir Winston Churchill often said: ``You make your living by what you 
get, you make your life by what you give.'' Michael gave so much to so 
many for so long and truly lived a complete and full life. His public 
service, his devotion to his family, and his service to his community 
and nation, reflect the legacy he leaves and the joy we must celebrate. 
Truly the world is a better place because of the life Michael led.
  Michael Reed accomplished so much in his life, but none of this would 
have been possible without the grace of God, the love and support of 
his loving wife, Attorney Diane Fields Reed, his late father-in-law, 
Judge Richard Fields, their beloved dog, Alexandra, and a host of 
family and friends that will miss him dearly.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives 
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with countless others throughout 
Georgia and the Nation in saluting and honoring Mr. Michael Joseph Reed 
for service to his community, to his country, and to humankind; and in 
extending our deepest condolences to Michael Reed's family, friends, 
loved ones, and all those who mourn his loss. We pray that we will all 
be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in 
the days, weeks, and months ahead.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Catholic Schools Week 
across the Nation, we come together to recognize and honor the profound 
impact of Catholic education. On January 31st, we marked National 
Appreciation Day for Catholic Schools, a day that acknowledges the 
enduring commitment of these institutions to educate not only the mind 
but also the soul. Catholic Schools, like St. Ann's in Wilmington, 
Delaware where my grandchildren attend, instill faith, academic 
excellence, and service in their students. Together, we are not just 
celebrating a week; we are celebrating the noble mission of Catholic 
education, to educate the whole child and transcend the boundaries of 
traditional learning. God bless our Catholic Schools and God Bless the 
United States of America.

   INTRODUCTION OF RESOLUTION TO CONDEMN THE ETHNIC VIOLENCE IN THE 
                    DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

                                 ______

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my resolution 
condemning the ethnic violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC). Dr. King famously said, ``injustice anywhere is a threat to 
justice everywhere''. The United States, credible human rights 
organizations, and civil society have documented and published reports 
and findings that implicate the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo in aiding and collaborating with armed groups and 
militias, including several that are designated for United Nations 
sanctions due to human rights violations.
  Militias engage in illicit mining activities to finance and sustain 
themselves, often exploiting child labor and engaging in environmental 
degradation practices that undermine the DRC's economic interests and 
international treaty obligations.
  My resolution condemns all acts of violence perpetrated against 
ethnic minorities by members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and armed groups operating throughout the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. It reaffirms that the United States 
has held and continues to hold the Government of the DRC responsible 
for upholding the rights of all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, in 
accordance with the DRC's international obligations.
  My timely resolution also holds accountable all state security forces 
that perpetrate atrocities against the civilian population by 
conducting transparent investigations and prosecutions and taking all 
additional necessary measures to prevent further atrocities continue 
progress toward the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, 
reparation, and resettlement of armed groups in coordination with the 
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, as outlined in United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 2666 (2022). Last, it calls on the President Joe Biden to 
appoint a Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa, which will 
be vital to addressing the enduring regional security crisis emanating 
from eastern DRC.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in condemning the 
ethnic violence in the DRC.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past January, I had the pleasure of 
attending Jason Fetrow's Eagle Scout Court of Honor to celebrate his 
achievement of the highest honor in the scouting world. Jason started 
his journey with the scouts at just six years old when he joined Cub 
Scout Pack twelve. At age eleven, he moved up to the Boy Scouts who 
have allowed him incredible experiences such as the opportunity to 
attend the World Jamboree in 2019. For his Eagle Scout Project, Jason 
decided to give back to the fields where he played baseball for eleven 
years by expanding the trophy case at Gabriel Memorial Baseball Fields 
by three feet so it can better accommodate the growing number of 
trophies on display. Just last year, Jason graduated from Cedar Creek 
High School and he now studies Exercise Science at Stockton University. 
It was my honor to celebrate this milestone with Jason and wish him all 
the best in his future. God Bless Jason and God Bless the United States 
of America.

  There was no objection.
  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest chaplain,

Jaymie, and we celebrated the arrival of their three children, Bella, 
Mia, and Ethan. I also stood next to him as a pallbearer at the funeral 
of his 28-year-old brother, Joseph.
  Mr. Speaker, I and so many others in Indiana's Second District will 
forever be grateful for the impact that Dr. Michael Cramer has had on 
us as individuals, as well as the Kingdom of God.

       I hereby appoint the Honorable Brandon Williams to act as 
     Speaker pro tempore on this day.
                                                     Mike Johnson,
     Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                     TRIBUTE TO HOPE ALLISON DABNEY

  (Mr. HERN asked and was given permission to address the House for one 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable 
American, Hope Allison Dabney.
  To all who knew her, Hope's infectious smile and warm demeanor 
impacted the lives of so many.
  Hope was a cherished daughter, sister, cousin, niece, granddaughter, 
and friend.
  She was a dedicated gymnast, a talented singer, a skillful pole-
vaulter, a fierce Auburn football fan, and hundreds of other things.

[[Page H368]]

  As a testament to Hope's character, she volunteered at River Edge, a 
nonprofit organization in Georgia that provides mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment, as well as services for individuals 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
  The news of her passing at just 26 years of age has left many hearts 
broken across the country. May we find solace in the knowledge that her 
spirit lives on in the hearts of those she touched. May Hope's legacy 
inspire acts of kindness and warmth, echoing the love and friendliness 
that defines her time with us for so many years.
  My wife, Tammy, and I, along with the staff of Oklahoma's First 
Congressional District unite in prayer for the Dabney family and all 
those who were blessed to know Hope.

                       ONE YEAR SINCE DERAILMENT

  (Mr. DELUZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
one minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this weekend, my constituents in 
Beaver County and our East Palestine neighbors lived through Norfolk 
Southern's disastrous train derailment. They caused a massive toxic 
fireball. Frankly, we are lucky that no one died.
  Since then, what has Congress done to protect our communities, to 
make freight rail safer?
  Absolutely nothing.
  Folks in western Pennsylvania are sick and tired of being treated 
like collateral damage in the way of corporate profits.
  Those railroad profits have not been shabby. From 2018 to last year, 
Norfolk Southern enriched their shareholders with $18 billion.
  My bill, the Railway Safety Act, is supported by the Biden 
administration and former President Trump and will make rail safer. 
This shouldn't be partisan. Along with my Democratic colleagues, I am 
joined by nine Republican cosponsors, and, yet, nothing has changed.
  The railroads are running the show here like it is the 19th century. 
It is time for politicians to stop carrying their water, to stop 
treating my constituents and our neighbors like fodder.
  We need action. It is time to pass the Railway Safety Act.

             HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS

  (Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address 
the House for one minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, since being sworn into 
office, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has failed in 
his duty to keep our Nation safe.
  In December, more than 300,000 illegal immigrants crossed into our 
country.
  By using so-called parole to allow millions of illegal immigrants 
into the United States and by ending the remain in Mexico policy, 
Secretary Mayorkas has manufactured a national security disaster.
  This crisis isn't just contained to Texas and Arizona. The deadly 
drugs, like fentanyl, that have poured into our Nation on Secretary 
Mayorkas' watch have made each and every State a border State.
  It is clear that Secretary Mayorkas is unfit to hold office, that his 
inaction has cost Americans dearly. It has cost American lives.
  It is time for this Congress to impeach Secretary Mayorkas for his 
failure to uphold the law.

              DRACONIAN LAWS IMPOSED ON THE STATE OF TEXAS

  (Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for one minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing the barbaric 
consequences of the draconian laws that extreme MAGA Republicans are 
imposing on the State of Texas.
  Over 26,000 women have become pregnant after being raped since Texas 
outlawed abortion with no exceptions. Let me repeat that: 26,000 women. 
This could be your daughter, sister, cousin, niece, or mother.
  Experiencing sexual assault is one of the hardest things that a woman 
can heal from.
  Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans have made it a mission to trap 
women, destroy their plans and goals, and ultimately chain them to 
their trauma for the rest of their lives.
  No woman should be shamed for what they have been through.
  I will continue to fight for reproductive rights and make sure that 
no woman should be afraid to make the decisions that are right for her. 
I will always fight for people over politics.

                            ISRAELI HOSTAGES

  (Mr. YAKYM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
one minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Ziv and 
Gali Berman.
  Ziv and Gali are 26-year-old twin brothers. Like many twin brothers 
with that special bond, they do everything together. They work as light 
technicians in the same sound and light company, root for the same 
soccer team, and have traveled the world together.
  They were also, tragically, 2 of more than 240 men, women, children, 
and elderly who were brutally kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on October 
7.
  For 118 days now, Ziv and Gali have endured unspeakable horrors at 
the hands of their Hamas captors in Gaza. For 118 days, they have had 
to summon the incredible courage to hope, not sure if they will ever 
see their home and family again.
  I rise today not only to share their story, but also to demand that 
Hamas release Ziv and Gali immediately, along with the more than 130 
hostages remaining in Gaza.
  Israel has acted in good faith during the ongoing negotiations. They 
have shown they are serious about a pause in fighting so hostages can 
be returned home. It is past time to bring Ziv and Gali home.
  It is past time to bring them all home.

                       IN HONOR OF DR. FRED PRIMM

  (Ms. SEWELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
one minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life 
and legacy of Dr. Fred Primm, who passed away on January 19, 2024, at 
the age of 57.
  Dr. Primm was a true Renaissance man. He was an educator, Air Force 
Naval Reservist, pastor, teacher, coach, adjunct professor, consultant, 
a Kappa man, and the superintendent for Sumter County Schools and 
Bessemer City Schools.
  Dr. Primm was truly a respected and beloved community leader. 
Educated at Alabama A&M, Auburn, and Nova Southeastern, Dr. Primm was a 
true servant leader, and he led in every aspect of his life. He made 
his commitment to serving others his life's top priority, and serve he 
did. Our community and the lives of his students are all the better 
because of him.
  His life is a true testament to the transformational power of 
education.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the exceptional life 
and legacy of Dr. Fred Primm.
  May his family find comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on 
in the many lives that he touched.

                  CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS

  (Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for one minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the winners 
of this year's Virginia's Fifth District Congressional App Challenge.
  Every year, middle and high school students submit their applications 
to participate in the Congressional App Challenge, a complex 
competition where students interested in STEM code an application of 
their preference.
  Adrian Park, Sean Fu, and Emmet Lach from Albemarle High School 
produced an extraordinary app, called Illness IQ, to help individuals 
detect and diagnose medical symptoms without having to see a doctor.

[[Page H369]]

  After tragically losing a close friend to heart disease, Adrian and 
his classmates were inspired to develop a tool to access critical 
medical information in a user-friendly app. The app meets a significant 
need in the healthcare marketplace, using intricate technology, pre-
gathered scientific data, and user input to diagnose individual 
symptoms with a 97 percent success rate.
  I commend Adrian, Sean, and Emmet for their hard work in creating 
this innovative app, and I encourage them to continue excelling in 
their academic and professional pursuits.
  I am honored to represent these outstanding students in the Fifth 
District of Virginia.

          COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF RITCHIE VALENS

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and 
legacy of one of San Fernando Valley's great sons, Ritchie Valens, on 
the 65th anniversary of his tragic death known as the day the music 
died.
  Richard Steven Valenzuela, better known as Ritchie Valens, was born 
in my hometown of Pacoima, California, in 1941. Ritchie was only 17 
when songs like ``Come on, Let's Go,'' ``Donna,'' and ``La Bamba'' 
topped the charts, they defined an era of rock and roll music, and 
opened the doors for future Latino artists all across our country.
  On February 3, 1959, Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly, and the Big Bopper 
tragically lost their lives in a plane crash.
  Ritchie Valens' legacy lives on in his music, the Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame, and public spaces like the Pacoima Post Office. A Member of 
Congress' name was inspired by Ritchie.
  Ritchie Valens is an example of the amazing talent that exists in our 
community, and his legacy will continue to be a source of pride for the 
entire San Fernando Valley for generations to come.

                            SOUTHERN BORDER

  (Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's southern border 
and immigration systems are dysfunctional, and it has been this way for 
decades under multiple Presidents and under multiple Houses and Senates 
under both parties.
  Hundreds of thousands of people cross our border every month. Our 
immigration courts are understaffed with an immense backlog of cases. 
Much of the fentanyl crossing the border comes through legal points of 
entry, 95 percent of which is brought by legal residents.
  Mr. Speaker, where do we go from here?
  We have to find real, bipartisan solutions for a secure border and a 
healthy, humane immigration process.
  While our colleagues in the Senate seek solutions to both, our 
Republican majority seeks solutions to neither. They would rather keep 
this issue alive, scare their supporters, and serve the shadow 
government of the former President.
  In the face of progress, they are stalling, orchestrating a sham 
impeachment, rather than making real policy; policies that could ensure 
a better funded Border Patrol, up-to-date fentanyl detection 
technology, well-staffed courts, and an immigration system that 
supports those seeking asylum, refuge, and opportunity, which is the 
very story and value of our Nation.

                 PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM DUIs ACT

  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 980, 
I call up the bill (H.R. 6976) to amend the Immigration and Nationality 
Act to provide that aliens who have been convicted of or who have 
committed an offense for driving while intoxicated or impaired are 
inadmissible and deportable, and ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 980, in lieu of 
the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on the Judiciary printed in the bill, an amendment in the 
nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 
118-22 is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                               H.R. 6976

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Our Communities from 
     DUIs Act''.

     SEC. 2. INADMISSIBILITY AND DEPORTABILITY RELATED TO DRIVING 
                   WHILE INTOXICATED OR IMPAIRED.

       (a) Inadmissibility.--Section 212(a)(2) of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)) is amended by 
     adding at the end the following:
       ``(J) Driving while intoxicated or impaired.--Any alien who 
     has been convicted of, who admits having committed, or who 
     admits committing acts which constitute the essential 
     elements of an offense for driving while intoxicated or 
     impaired, as those terms are defined under the law of the 
     jurisdiction where the conviction, offense, or acts 
     constituting the essential elements of the offense occurred 
     (including an offense for driving while under the influence 
     of or impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to 
     whether the conviction or offense is classified as a 
     misdemeanor or felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local 
     law, is inadmissible.''.
       (b) Deportability.--Section 237(a)(2) of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)) is amended by 
     adding at the end the following:
       ``(G) Driving while intoxicated or impaired.--Any alien who 
     has been convicted of an offense for driving while 
     intoxicated or impaired, as those terms are defined under the 
     law of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred 
     (including a conviction for driving while under the influence 
     of or impaired by alcohol or drugs), without regard to 
     whether the conviction is classified as a misdemeanor or 
     felony under Federal, State, tribal, or local law, is 
     deportable.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 
1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.
  After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further 
amendment printed in part D of House Report 118-362, if offered by the 
Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall 
be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally 
divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not 
be subject to a demand for a division of the question.
  The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Moore) and the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Nadler) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Moore).


                             General Leave

  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 6976.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Alabama?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, every 45 minutes: that is how often someone in the 
United States dies in a crash involving an alcohol-impaired driver.
  In 2021 alone, there were 13,384 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities. 
In the same year, drunk driving crashes led to 400,000 injuries. Those 
crashes don't discriminate. The victim could be me, it could be you, or 
it could be one of our family members.
  This issue hits close to home for me. There was a newlywed couple 
from my hometown of Enterprise, Alabama, named Angel and Jeremy Seay. I 
knew them personally.
  Angel and Jeremy were riding a motorcycle together when, out of 
nowhere, an illegal alien under the influence of alcohol collided into 
the newlyweds with his pickup. Their lives were cut dramatically short.
  Sadly, tragedies like this are not uncommon across our country.
  Consider this case from Missouri. Just 2 months ago, an illegal alien 
from Honduras was sentenced for driving drunk at 100 miles per hour and 
killing a man.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, if you listen to my Democratic colleagues, you may 
think

[[Page H370]]

that drunk driving is no big deal. In fact, at a Judiciary Committee 
markup in 2021, my Democratic colleagues voted down three Republican 
amendments that would have made certain aliens ineligible for green 
cards if they had 1, 2, or even 10 DUI convictions.
  Despite that, that should come as no surprise.
  In 2020, then-candidate Joe Biden said that illegal aliens with DUI 
convictions should be allowed to stay in the United States. Biden 
asserted that ICE should not arrest aliens with drunk driving 
convictions because: You only arrest for the purpose of dealing with a 
felony that is committed, and I don't count drunk driving as a felony.
  Candidate Biden even called for ICE officers to be fired if they 
arrested aliens without felony convictions.
  To President Biden and my Democratic colleagues, today we say: 
Absolutely not. If you are a guest in this country and you drive drunk, 
you should be removed from our country, period.
  Instead of hearing agreement on this from Democrats, today we will 
hear these farfetched hypotheticals and accusations that this bill is 
cruel and too broad.
  Instead of engaging in hypotheticals, let's again revisit the facts: 
Drunk drivers are involved in 31 percent of all crash deaths in the 
country.
  On average, drunk driving has killed nearly 11,000 people in the 
United States every year from 2012 to 2021. Yet, immigration laws do 
not explicitly make aliens inadmissible or removable if they drive 
drunk and recklessly break our laws.
  H.R. 6976 changes that, and it creates safer streets and safer 
communities for all of us.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Protect Our 
Communities From DUIs Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill is just another page from the majority's tired 
old playbook of inventing perceived gaps in the law and providing 
overly broad legislation to fix them.
  DUIs are a serious problem. Over 13,000 people died in alcohol 
impaired driving traffic deaths in 2021, and all of those deaths were 
preventable. However, instead of working on proven solutions like 
improving access to public transportation and ride-sharing programs so 
that people have an alternative to driving drunk, Republicans are 
laying the blame for this problem at the feet of immigrants.
  Let me be clear. No one here wants to see individuals who are true 
threats to public safety eligible for immigration benefits. However, 
our immigration laws already exclude public safety threats from being 
able to get visas or legally remain in the country. Under our current 
laws, this includes those who have committed serious DUI offenses.
  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a noncitizen who is 
convicted of or admits to committing a crime involving moral turpitude, 
or a CIMT, is generally inadmissible. Likewise, a noncitizen who is 
convicted of a CIMT, where a sentence of 1 year or longer may be 
imposed, is deportable.
  There is substantial case law demonstrating that serious DUI offenses 
are considered CIMTs under current law. DUI where the maximum possible 
penalty is a year or more and where there is serious bodily harm; hit-
and-runs; an aggravated DUI; and a DUI involving driving with knowledge 
of an invalid, suspended, or revoked license are all CIMTs and are, 
therefore, already deportable offenses.
  This means that under current law, the people who are drinking and 
driving and putting people at risk of harm are already removable. 
Nonetheless, the majority is not satisfied with this. They want to 
deport everyone who has ever received any conviction for any DUI 
offense. Here is the problem with this approach: every State has a 
different standard for how they define and prosecute DUIs. Some States 
will charge people with a DUI even if they are not actually driving a 
car.
  For example, prosecutors in Virginia convicted a man of DUI who was 
inebriated and asleep in the driver's seat of his car with the keys in 
the ignition so he could listen to music in his driveway. This case, in 
which the driver never even left his driveway or even turned his car 
all the way on, went all the way to the Virginia Supreme Court. We 
cannot rely on prosecutorial discretion in this type of case.
  Under case law, the man in this case would not ultimately be subject 
to removal based on this conviction if he was a noncitizen. 
Nevertheless, if this bill were to be enacted, such a conviction would 
lead to the deportation of even a longstanding green card holder.
  Remember, Mr. Speaker, we are talking here about longstanding green 
card holders, not illegal aliens. These are people who entered the 
country legally, who may have been here for 20 or 30 years, who have 
American citizen spouses and children.
  If this bill were enacted, such a conviction of sleeping in your own 
car inebriated in your own driveway going nowhere would get you 
deported.
  If this bill fixed a serious gap in the law, I would be supportive. 
Nevertheless, this bill doesn't do that. It puts people who are here 
legally at risk of removal for making even a minor mistake that harmed 
no one, all at a time when immigration courts have historic backlogs 
and the Republicans are refusing to provide DHS with the resources it 
needs to enforce the laws currently on the books.
  This is purely for show, but I would expect nothing less from a party 
that has admitted they would rather wait to fix the problems in our 
immigration system so that President Trump can preserve the issue for 
his campaign than actually work toward meaningful reform now.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, Democrats want to pretend that 
this bill is extreme, cruel, and harsh, as if imposing consequences on 
aliens for breaking our laws is somehow unheard of.
  Yet, guess who also bar drunk drivers entry into ports?
  Canada. That is correct.
  In at least this one particular area, our liberal friends to the 
north get it right. Of course they do because it just makes sense. Mr. 
Speaker, if you are a guest in our country, and you drive drunk or 
impaired, you shouldn't be allowed to stay here as we wait for you to 
do it again or to kill or seriously injure someone.
  Mr. Speaker, let's pass H.R. 6976 today and make these sensible 
changes.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Posey).
  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for 
yielding and for bringing forth this great bill to protect Americans.
  Over the last few days, I have heard more lies about the immigration 
crisis at our southern border than any other issue since ObamaCare.
  Mr. Speaker, you remember ObamaCare. We promised that you could keep 
your own insurance company, promised you can keep your own doctor, and 
promised it would cost less. These were all lies, but the lies about 
immigration are even greater this year.
  This week I heard a Member across the aisle in an apparent theatric 
and disingenuous gesture of good will falsely refer to me as being his 
friend as he hurled lie after lie denigrating my colleagues and me. 
Although I do have friends on the other side of the aisle, this is not 
my kind of friend.
  He hurled lie after lie and insult after insult as he theatrically 
appealed to those listening or watching on this House floor--which 
incidentally is against the rules of the House, and I am surprised the 
Speaker did not call him out of order--as he referred to my colleagues 
and me as MAGA Republican extremists.
  Some people are called Trump phobic. They can't say Trump's name 
without Republican extremist attached to it.
  He claimed that we didn't want to solve the crisis at the border. 
Calling anyone who wants our country to have a secure border a MAGA 
Republican extremist is not only a clear sign of acute Trump phobia, 
but it is clear evidence of just how out of touch some people are with 
the overwhelming majority of Americans and reality for that matter.

                              {time}  0930

  There may be some--however, I don't know them--Republicans, 
Democrats, or Independents who actually believe

[[Page H371]]

that when somebody breaks into your home, that they are entitled to 
become a member of your family.
  How about being honest here for a change?
  He knew, I know, everyone knows, even the most challenged Trumphobics 
know that, despite President Biden's and Secretary Mayorkas' numerous 
fantasy denials, there has, in fact, been a crisis at our southern 
border, and it began when the President took office.
  Now, our President finally acknowledges that we have a border crisis 
and said he will fix it, but only if we give him more money to more 
quickly process more illegals. That will not fix the crisis at the 
border.
  The bizarre proposal that the border can be secured while still 
allowing 5,000 illegals a day to invade our country is like claiming it 
is possible to be half pregnant.
  You have a right to stand with the drug cartels, but I and the rest 
of the MAGA Republicans stand with Texas and the United States of 
America.
  The sovereignty of our Nation, the safety and security of American 
communities is not up for negotiation. It can only be fixed by the 
President reversing his executive orders that created the invasion in 
the first place, or the adoption of H.R. 2.
  In the meantime, I am more than happy to support Congressman Moore's 
H.R. 6976 to save American lives.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the ranking 
Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 6976.
  Once again, the majority is wasting our time by putting forward a 
piece of legislation that has zero chance of becoming law and that is 
extraordinarily broad. No one condones driving under the influence. We 
should do everything we can to prevent people from getting behind the 
wheel while intoxicated, but this bill, designed to scapegoat and 
denigrate immigrants, will not solve the serious problem of DUIs.
  Public safety threats, including those who have been convicted of 
serious DUI offenses, are already inadmissible and removable under the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, and this bill would not change or 
enhance that.
  Under the INA, a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude 
where the punishment can be for a year or longer makes an individual 
deportable. Courts have ruled over and over again that serious DUI 
offenses that put others at risk are CIMTs and make the perpetrators 
deportable.
  But this bill isn't about serious offenses, Mr. Speaker. Far from it.
  The bill says that a conviction for a single DUI offense, 
misdemeanor, or felony makes you instantly deportable and an admission 
to such a offense makes you instantly inadmissible. No questions asked.
  I can understand, maybe, the appeal of something that sounds like a 
zero-tolerance policy, but let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, if we had that 
kind of policy here in the House of Representatives, there would be 
several Members that would not be Members of this Chamber.
  Moreover, by including every single type of DUI offense, this bill 
would make someone deportable for not driving under the influence. That 
is because States have a wide variety of opinions on what is a DUI. For 
example, Arizona's DUI statute allows people to be charged with a DUI 
if they are intoxicated and have ``physical control'' of their vehicle.
  The Ninth Circuit found that the breadth of this statute means--and I 
am quoting here, ``One may be convicted under it for sitting in one's 
own car in one's own driveway with the key in the ignition and a bottle 
of beer in one's hand.''
  Because of this, the Ninth Circuit determined that a conviction under 
this statute was insufficient to count as a deportable offense. As the 
court put it, ``Drunken driving is despicable. Having physical control 
of a car while drinking is not''--their words, not mine.
  As many places across the country experience cold spells in the last 
week or so, there are States that would allow prosecution of someone 
simply if they were sitting in their car with the heat on while 
inebriated even if it was in their own driveway.
  Current law allows judges to use their discretion to look at the 
broader facts of the case. This bill would strip that discretion away 
from them and would mandate that even someone whose only crime was 
sitting in a parked car while inebriated must be deported.
  Let's not forget that deportability grounds, like the one that this 
bill would create, impact immigrants who are here lawfully, those who 
my colleagues always like to say, ``came the right way.''
  By the way, Mr. Speaker, I am one of those. I came here to this 
country at 16 years old. It took me 17 years to get my citizenship, and 
here I am as a proud Member of the United States House of 
Representatives.
  Are we really saying that we think the best use of our very limited 
Federal Government resources is to work on deporting a green card 
holder who decided to sleep in their car rather than drive home drunk 
from a bar? A green card holder not trying to drive drunk, just trying 
to stay warm? I certainly don't think that is a good use of our 
resources. It is certainly not a good use of our time on this floor.
  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it clear 
that they are not interested in sensible solutions, just in 
sensationalism. This bill is another example of that.
  Also, I hope my colleagues will stop referring to people as illegals. 
People are human beings. They have different statuses. Some are 
undocumented. If you want to say some are illegal, but let's not call 
human beings illegal. I am tired of that language.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), a former law enforcement officer and a 
good friend of ours.

  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, President Biden, today, by executive order 
can end catch and release, cease the exploitation of the parole 
authority, reinstate remain in Mexico, expand expedited removal 
authority, and renew building the wall.
  By executive order, Mr. Speaker, he can do that, which will stop the 
illegal immigration by 80 percent, just those executive orders. He can 
do that today.
  Mr. Speaker, I am horrified and I am dismayed. We have been shouting 
from the rooftops that the border is a crisis for years. And finally, 
finally, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are beginning to 
acknowledge there is a problem just in time for an election.
  How shocking?
  Just like when they switched from ``defund the police'' to pro-police 
rhetoric in 2022 just before the election. They have this playbook down 
pat.
  Since the President has taken office, Mr. Speaker, there have been 
over 7 million illegal crossings at our southern border. Over 8.3 
million illegal crossings nationwide. Yes, that is right. Our southern 
border is in such disarray and has sucked up so much of our resources 
that our northern border is wide open, and the cartels are taking 
advantage, including in the State of New York where my esteemed 
colleague, who is claiming time in opposition on the other side of the 
aisle, is from.
  His State is in desperate need of help from illegals taking over 
their cities, overrunning their public safety, overrunning their 
schools, overrunning their social services, and he stands up here, Mr. 
Speaker, and says there is nothing wrong.
  This crisis is personal, as it is impacting the safety and security 
of my constituents. In 2022, Minnesota resort owners along the Canadian 
border in Minnesota caught illegal immigrants trespassing on their 
property.
  Last fall, a young girl in Bemidji, Minnesota, was sexually assaulted 
and 11 illegal immigrants were found at the scene.
  And just last week, Mr. Speaker, authorities arrested an al-Shabaab 
terrorist in Minneapolis. The terrorist was caught at the southern 
border 1 year prior and released back into our country by the Biden 
administration's catch and release. They allowed him to roam for 1 year 
in this country, and it is alleged, Mr. Speaker, that he was trading in 
illegal arms.
  I fear it is only a matter of time before another September 11 occurs 
on our soil, and we must not let that happen.

[[Page H372]]

  If Democrats were serious about making our border secure, they would 
encourage their colleagues in the Senate to pass the already House-
passed bill, H.R. 2, the most strongest worded piece of legislation on 
our border in this country's history.
  They can get it to his desk immediately for President Biden to sign, 
or they would call on the President to use his executive authorities, 
as I already stated, to reinstate President Trump's policies that were 
keeping our Nation safe.
  But they are not serious, so, yes, I am here today to beg my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle to vote for this bill that 
would make illegal immigrants convicted of a DUI deportable or 
inadmissible to our country.
  Because of my law enforcement background, Mr. Speaker, I am probably 
one of the very few Members of Congress who has ever been to the scene 
of a drunk driving accident where there was a death. One of very few 
who has delivered death notices to unsuspecting families or victims, 
and I pray that none of you ever have to deliver or receive such 
heartbreaking news.
  At a minimum, Mr. Speaker, we should keep illegal immigrants who 
drive under the influence of alcohol and put people's lives in danger 
out of this country.
  To my Democratic colleagues, I ask: Get on the side of public safety 
and law enforcement all of the time, not just during election years. 
This is an easy vote, and I ask my colleagues to do the right thing and 
vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6976.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. Curtis).
  Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6976, the 
Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act.
  I have personally been to the southern border and seen the crisis 
firsthand. I don't care your political persuasion, all of us know what 
is happening down there is wrong and needs to be corrected.
  The first duty of the Federal Government is to protect American 
citizens, and this cannot be done without securing our border. I am 
pleased that the House has taken the steps this week to do so.
  It is not clear under current law that individuals illegally in this 
country can be deported for driving while intoxicated. This legislation 
would ensure any noncitizen convicted or admitting to driving under the 
influence would no longer be allowed to remain in the United States. 
This shouldn't be controversial.
  When you drive drunk, you are putting your neighbors and the broader 
community at unacceptable risk, and that we cannot allow.
  Also, this week, we passed legislation that would allow law 
enforcement to prosecute criminals who intentionally refuse to stop for 
Border Patrol agents. The practice of running from Border Patrol agents 
is dangerous for residents, patrol officers, and the fugitive. I hold 
deep compassion for those who are in circumstances that they feel the 
need to enter the United States illegally. However, we are a country of 
laws and need to ensure individuals know they need to enter the United 
States only through the legal manners.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

                              {time}  0945

  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Self).
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6976, the Protect 
our Communities from DUIs Act.
  I will be on the border Saturday yet again, and it is a total mess. 
Illegal aliens continue to surge through the southern border and are 
overwhelming many States, to include those from the other side of the 
aisle.
  In addition to the fentanyl overdoses and cartel violence, drunk 
driving has been a major issue that has senselessly taken too many 
American lives.
  Last year, 52-year-old Special Olympian Craig Schimming was hit and 
killed in a car wreck on his way to church by an illegal alien drunk 
and high on meth.
  Devastating stories like this happen far too often across our 
country, and there is absolutely no reason illegal aliens with DUI 
convictions should be able to stay in the United States.
  The Protect our Communities from DUIs Act would deport illegal aliens 
who have been convicted of or committed the offense of driving while 
drunk or impaired.
  This is commonsense legislation, and every Member of the people's 
House should support this bill.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, the last few speakers on the Republican side spent most 
of their time not addressing this bill but addressing the general 
crisis at our southern border.
  The fact is there is a crisis. We all know that. The fact is that one 
of the major problems--and Republicans say this all the time, and they 
are right--is catch and release.
  Someone is caught or more usually turns themselves in to a Border 
Patrol officer, claims asylum, and is given a court date 4 years, 5 
years down the road. Why? Because we do not have enough asylum 
officers. We do not have enough asylum judges.
  President Biden requested $14 billion to increase the number of 
Border Patrol men and women and to increase the number of asylum judges 
and immigration judges so that you wouldn't have catch and release; so 
that people who claimed asylum would have their cases adjudicated in 
weeks, not in years.
  Those who are entitled to asylum would be admitted to the country and 
could work and those who are not could be swiftly removed, deported 
from the country.
  Do our Republican colleagues want to do that? No. They don't want to 
give the President the means of alleviating this problem. They want a 
campaign issue, and they are very open about it.
  You have in the Senate a painstakingly negotiated and extraordinarily 
conservative--so we hear, I haven't seen the text yet--strong 
immigration bill negotiated by such liberals as Senator Lankford and 
Senator Graham, and they are going to pass it, in all likelihood.
  The Republicans in the House say we won't even look at it. Why? 
Because the former President, President Trump, said don't pass 
anything. I want a campaign issue.
  They don't want to solve the problem. They want to keep the problem 
going as a campaign issue, and they said it themselves.
  Don't get up here and talk about the problems on the southern border 
when you won't give this President any of the authority or the means 
that he seeks to deal with it when you say, as Speaker Johnson said, 
you are not going to even look at the bill from the Senate because it 
isn't perfect. Since when do we insist on perfect legislation?
  Now, Mr. Speaker, let's get to this bill. DUIs are a serious problem, 
and no one who poses a threat to public safety should be eligible for 
immigration benefits, but that is already the case under current law.
  This legislation is a gross overreach that would lead to absurd 
consequences and deportation for people who pose no threat to our 
country, such as the examples we heard of someone who, rather than 
driving drunk, is in his own car inebriated with the key turned on, 
listening to music in his own driveway, posing a threat to no one.
  Even for people who have been here many years, with American citizen 
spouses and children, that would lead to automatic deportation while 
doing nothing that our laws do not already do to deter people from 
driving under the influence--driving under the influence as opposed to 
sitting in their driveway under the influence.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleagues on 
the left. First, my colleagues across the aisle say that it is a 
campaign issue, that we are trying to make this is a campaign issue.
  It is not. They made it a campaign issue when Joe Biden came in day 
one and did away with the remain in Mexico policy, when they started 
this catch and release program, and now they are saying they need more 
money. It is the executive orders that have created the problem on the 
U.S. southern border.

  I have been there a number of times--three times, to be exact--and

[[Page H373]]

Sheriff Dannels told us the best he had ever seen the border in 2018 
was under Donald Trump. The worst he has ever seen the border was then, 
and that was before the recent 200,000 people came across last month.
  To get up here and say that the administration needs more money or 
that they need some law--no. Biden has every tool in the toolbox to 
shut the U.S. southern border down, and he has continued to create 
crises for our communities. This government is so good often at setting 
the building on fire and then wanting to fund the fire department.
  We don't need more money. We just need to apply the laws that are on 
the books and shut this flow down across this border before more and 
more people get killed and injured in these accidents we are talking 
about.
  The Democrats would prefer to engage in these outlandish 
hypotheticals and make light of driving under the influence rather than 
protect American communities from dangerous drivers.
  Again, here are some facts. According to the Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving: Most drunk driving offenders drive at least 80 times drunk 
before they are arrested.
  Additionally, a 2014 article detailed how more than one-third of the 
individuals who are convicted of driving under the influence are repeat 
offenders.
  The Protect our Communities from DUIs Act ensures that aliens who 
drive drunk can be removed from the United States after their first 
conviction--not after the tenth, not after they kill or seriously 
injure a child of yours or mine or a grandchild--instead of spending 
time on a 50-State survey of DUI laws to formulate some farfetched 
hypotheticals.
  I encourage my colleagues to grapple with the consequences of drunk 
driving and support this commonsense bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 1 will not be offered.
  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill.
  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.


                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Steube). Pursuant to clause 9 of Rule 
20, this 15-minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-

A WARNING AGAINST THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S NEW INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR 
                                  RULE

  (Mr. KILEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Labor has announced a new 
independent contractor rule, which will cost millions of American jobs 
and be absolutely devastating for our workforce and our economy. We 
know that, because we have seen the effects of the law it was modeled 
on, AB 5, in California.
  As a warning against the Biden administration's new rule, I am 
sharing the stories of Californians who have suffered under that law.
  For example, Esther said: I help people who don't speak English 
communicate with medical providers. I am a proud senior, independent 
and self-sufficient. AB 5 leaves me out of work, unprotected, and 
isolated. It takes away my pride. It was passed without taking people 
like me into account.
  To spare millions of Americans the same fate as Esther, I am calling 
on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in Congressional 
Review Act legislation to nullify the Biden administration's new 
independent contractor rule.

                          ____________________

           COMMEMORATING 25 YEARS OF FAIRNESS IN MY HOMETOWN

  (Mr. McGARVEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 25 years of 
fairness in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.
  When I was a kid, it wasn't uncommon for someone to be fired just for 
being gay or kicked out of their home or denied service in a store or 
restaurant. We don't know how common it was because there was no 
official body to report it to, because it was completely legal. It is 
painful to think about.
  Fortunately, 25 years ago this week, a citizen-led effort in 
Louisville resulted in Kentucky's first fairness ordinance, one of the 
first in the Nation, banning discrimination against our LGBTQ+ 
neighbors.
  I thank everyone who courageously fought for this life-changing 
achievement way back in 1999.
  Today, 24 Kentucky communities and 31 States have these protections. 
It is time for the rest of our Commonwealth and our country to follow 
Louisville's lead.
  For my entire adult life, fairness has been a reality in Louisville, 
and we are all better for it.

                  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ECONOMIC POLICIES

  (Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, President Biden's economic policies continue 
to wreak havoc on families across our country, including the Tennessee 
families I represent.
  Prices have skyrocketed by 17.2 percent since the President was sworn 
into office. The experts tell us these rising prices are a direct 
result of the deficit spending of the last 3 years, coupled with rising 
energy costs. However, this administration continues to borrow and 
stifle American energy growth with multitudes of new and costly 
regulations.
  When President Biden took office, gas prices averaged less than $2 
per gallon in Tennessee. Right now, they are more than $3. This is a 
direct result of the President's ongoing war against American energy 
production.
  House Republicans remain committed to getting our fiscal house back 
in order by cutting deficit spending and passing legislation that 
robustly grows our economy to help get us out of the red.

                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the beginning of 
Black History Month. This month, we celebrate the tremendous 
contributions of African Americans to the growth of our Nation.
  Black History Month started as Negro History Week in February of 
1926. That week was chosen because it included the birthdays of 
President Abraham Lincoln and famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass.
  In 1976, they expanded it to create Black History Month. Today, 
Africans Americans make a difference in every aspect of American life. 
Black History Month is a time to remember that and highlight the fact 
that the African-American story is one that is rich and woven into the 
history of our great Nation.

           HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF E. PHILLIP HICKMAN

  (Mrs. KIGGANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. KIGGANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory 
of E. Phillip Hickman of Virginia's Eastern Shore.
  Born in July of 1952, Phil group up in northern Accomack County, 
graduating from Atlantic High School. He attended Virginia Tech, 
studying agricultural economics, and returned to the shore upon 
graduation.
  Together with his brother David, they founded Dublin Farms in 
Horntown, Virginia, and built it into the center of potato growing in 
the Commonwealth.
  Phil was extremely active in the Virginia agriculture community, 
serving as the chairman of the Virginia State Seed Potato Board, 
National Potato Board, and countless other local organizations.
  Matching his dedication to his community was his next-level 
enthusiasm for the Virginia Tech Hokies, owning a maroon pickup, an 
orange boat, and a van dedicated to tailgating. If it was a Saturday 
during football season, you could count on Phil to be cheering on Tech.
  Phil was a devoted family man, raising the next generation of great 
Virginia farmers at Dublin Farms. He leaves behind a wife, son, 
daughter-in-law, two grandchildren, and his brother.
  Phil Hickman embodied the culture and values of the Eastern Shore, 
leaving behind an unforgettable legacy. The Commonwealth mourns his 
loss.

                  MAKE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT PERMANENT

  (Ms. STANSBURY asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H375]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, we just voted here in the House to bring 
back the child tax credit, one of the most important and effective 
efforts to help working families and to lift children out of poverty in 
generations.
  These payments will provide a crucial lifeline to families struggling 
to make ends meet. The previous child tax credit helped almost 75,000 
families across my district alone. Here are some of the stories that we 
heard.
  One said: It was the only thing keeping my family afloat while my 
partner was able to pursue his dream of starting a business.
  Another said: As working parents, we struggled between childcare 
costs and paying a mortgage. The child tax credit was the only thing 
keeping us afloat.
  Another said: It was the thing that helped pay down my student loans.
  These are just a few of the many stories of how the child tax credit 
gave New Mexico families a lifeline. Here we are this week fighting to 
get it passed. I will not stop until we make the permanent child tax 
credit a reality and get it across the finish line.

                        CHILD TAX CREDIT RELIEF

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, after a long fight, and as a senior 
member of the Budget Committee, we have gotten to a point where we can 
say to the American people: We care about you, and we care about your 
families and most of all your children.
  The first step yesterday of taking a leap to be able to establish for 
this Nation permanent child tax credit relief is unbelievable in terms 
of the lives of America's children. Please be reminded that this is for 
our children.
  I cannot forget the emotions that I felt when I opened up the 
registration for the child tax relief during the pandemic, when the 
Biden administration gave that opportunity, and to see the mothers 
coming in with two and three children, one in a stroller, seeking to be 
able to get the relief that was needed.
  This permanent tax relief must be passed and, again, I will continue 
this fight into the Senate to ensure that in the middle of filing 
season this legislation could deepen relief for 16 million children and 
lift as many as 400,000 children above the poverty line in the first 
year alone. Increase the maximum refundability of the credit, giving 
eligible families the option to use their earned income from the prior 
year. That is crucial to be able to ensure that the child tax credit 
lifts our children up and helps our families. Let's get permanent child 
tax relief done.

                  CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
February as Career and Technical Education Month. In recognizing this 
month, we are highlighting the value that career and technical 
education has not just for our students but for our country.
  As the co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education 
Caucus, I am proud to be an advocate for CTE and the work that we do to 
support job training, apprenticeships, and CTE programs.
  Skills-based education provides learners of all ages with career-
ready skills, giving individuals the tools to succeed and restore the 
rungs on the ladder of opportunity. A highly skilled workforce is 
important to the success of our American workforce.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have the co-chair of the bipartisan CTE 
Caucus, Congresswoman Bonamici join me in introducing a resolution to 
recognize the importance of career and technical education.
  In Congress, I will continue to work feverishly to close our Nation's 
skills gap and provide our next generation of workers with the tools 
needed to succeed.

                  CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF AMP FIDDLER

  (Ms. TLAIB asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and legacy of 
Joseph ``Amp'' Fiddler as we mourn his passing.
  Amp Fiddler was born in Detroit and grew up surrounded by the sounds 
of Motown, rock, jazz, funk, and electronic music.
  His big break came when he joined the legendary George Clinton 
Parliament Funkadelic. It was during this time that Amp honed his 
skills on the keyboard and synthesizers, contributing significantly to 
the band's distinctive sound.
  Fiddler collaborated with many notable artists, like Prince and is 
credited with helping launch the pioneering hip-hop sounds of our own 
Detroit's legendary J Dilla.
  He enjoyed a long and successful solo career, marked by his 
distinctive blend of funk and contemporary sounds. Fiddler always 
remained humble and dedicated to his craft and our community.
  Please join me in recognizing Amp Fiddler, a true guiding force for 
Detroit's musical culture as we mourn his loss.

                   RESTORING SMART TAX POLICY MATTERS

  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, the tax and regulatory burdens on our 
businesses are crippling, and it is incumbent upon us to change that.
  Last night, Congress took a step in the right direction to do 
something positive to help businesses in this struggling economy. We 
came together to pass the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers 
Act. This bill will spur American innovation and competitiveness, will 
reinvigorate manufacturing jobs at home, and will restore Trump-era, 
business-friendly tax policies that spur economic growth.
  My east Texas businesses have been asking for a progrowth, projob, 
and pro-American tax package designed to revitalize our economy and 
provide relief to American small businesses. Last night, we provided 
such a package.
  Restoring smart tax policy matters. This bill extends the 2017 
Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that has a proven track record of 
incentivizing U.S. investment, lifting families out of poverty, and 
allowing Americans to keep more of their paychecks.
  I stand with our small businesses, and I thank Chairman Smith for his 
diligent work on this thoughtful tax policy.

                 RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF TIM MONAHAN

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
thank Tim Monahan for his 15 years of service to the House of 
Representatives.
  A native of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Tim began his service to the 
House by working with the Chief Administrative Officer. He later joined 
the staff of the House Appropriations Committee, where he worked on the 
Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Tim then joined the House 
Administration Committee, where he rose through the ranks, first as 
director of oversight, then deputy staff director, and finally staff 
director.
  At the beginning of this Congress, Speaker Kevin McCarthy elevated 
Tim to the director of House operations in the Office of the Speaker. 
He remained in this position to assist with the transition to Speaker   
Mike Johnson.
  In every position, Tim brought an unmatched level of understanding 
and creativity. He has implemented enterprise reforms that have helped 
make this a better place to conduct the people's business and improved 
the lives of everyone who works here.

[[Page H376]]

  Tim has become a trusted adviser and friend to everyone, from those 
serving at the heights of power to the men and women with the often 
thankless job of keeping this place operating. While Tim's service to 
the House is coming to an end for now, I know each of us will continue 
to experience the benefit of that service for years to come.
  I thank Tim and wish him good luck in all that is to come.

                  MICHAEL JOSEPH REED'S STRONG LEGACY

  (Mr. BISHOP of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember a dedicated 
public servant and appropriations policy adviser par excellence, my 
former chief of staff and friend, Michael Joseph Reed. Michael 
transitioned on Monday, January 15.
  Starting as a Presidential management intern at the U.S. Department 
of Transportation, he went on to serve two prolific congressional 
appropriators--Congressmen Lou Stokes of Ohio and Bill Gray of 
Pennsylvania.
  When I got a seat on the House Appropriations Committee in 2003, I 
needed a seasoned specialist and was blessed to have Michael Reed join 
my team, first as special assistant, then deputy chief of staff, and 
finally chief of staff and senior policy adviser.
  For 18 years I matriculated in the Michael Reed school of budgetary 
policy. He was a master. Learning the intricacies of ag policy, he 
became an asset to me and was highly respected on both sides of the 
aisle.
  Upon leaving the Hill, he was honored by the communities and 
industries he helped, including the University of Georgia College of 
Agriculture and the Georgia Peanut Commission, among others. The 
research and disaster relief he made possible for American agriculture 
are among his lasting legacies.
  Family and friends will celebrate his life in a private ceremony this 
week. We mourn his loss but thank God that his legacy of service will 
endure.

House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Biden economy has taken its 
toll on Main Streets in northeast Florida and all across America. From 
stores struggling, to jobs lost, to limited research and development, 
to chaotic inflation, we are in need of tax relief.
  There is a bill that gives immediate tax relief for families, 
farmers, and small businesses, that launches our economy forward, and 
finally ends the COVID giveaways. It is projobs, protaxpayer, pro-
America.
  Mr. Speaker, with the exception of Joe Biden, I don't believe there 
is another American who genuinely believes our Nation is headed in the 
right direction.
  I have got good news for America. The House has passed the Tax Relief 
for American Families and Workers Act. Help is on the way.

                  BIPARTISAN MAJORITY IS STILL STRONG

  (Mr. LANDSMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about what is at 
stake right now, who is here to lead, and who we have to watch out for.
  Last year, there was a small number of more extreme Members that took 
this country to the brink of default, but a bipartisan majority of us 
voted to stop that and to protect our economy. When the Speaker brought 
us a bipartisan bill to fix air travel, that same bipartisan majority 
of us voted to pass that, too.
  Is that bipartisan majority gone? No. We are still here.
  In fact, last night the Speaker brought to the floor a bipartisan 
bill to provide meaningful tax relief for families and small 
businesses, and we passed it overwhelmingly. So bring us a bipartisan 
budget to protect millions of jobs and critical investments in our 
families. We will pass that, too.
  Bring us the bipartisan bill agreement to fix the border. We will 
pass that.
  The largest majority in this House is our bipartisan majority. Bring 
us these bills. We will pass each and every one of them, and that is 
what the American people want and need us to do.

                       CHEROKEE COMPANY SEND-OFF

  (Mr. CLYDE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Georgia National 
Guard's Cherokee Company soldiers.
  Over the weekend, I was honored to attend a send-off ceremony in 
Gainesville, Georgia, for Cherokee Company troops ahead of their 
deployment to Kuwait. The following day our Nation learned the tragic 
news that three U.S. soldiers were killed at Tower 22 in Jordan by a 
drone attack carried out by Iranian-backed terrorists.
  During these times of global instability, we must honor, support, and 
thank our brave servicemembers who answer the call of duty to defend 
our country, preserve our peace, and protect our precious freedoms. I 
firmly believe that one of the best ways we can support both our troops 
deploying overseas and their families is through the power of prayer.
  I urge Georgia's Ninth District and all others in our State to join 
me in praying for strength, wisdom, and protection for our soldiers as 
well, as for peace and comfort for their loved ones.
  Father, may Your mighty right hand protect our Cherokee Company 
troops, as well as all of our Nation's warriors who serve so that we 
can live in freedom in the greatest country on Earth. May Psalm 91 be 
their banner. In Jesus' name. Amen.

                           ALOHA ALWAYS WINS

  (Ms. TOKUDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, last week I joined thousands of people, 
``kama'aina'' ``locals'' and ``malihini'' ``guests'' alike in walking 
from ``mauka'' ``inland'' to ``makai'' ``the ocean'' in Lahaina in a 
celebration of unity and healing.
  We lost so much in the fires--loved ones, homes, and businesses. The 
Lele Aloha Ho'ulu Lahaina Unity March reminded us that despite all we 
lost, we still have each other.
  Under a sea of flags representing the countries of both victims and 
survivors, we walked for everything we lost. With each step we took, we 
came closer together with shared hopes for Lahaina's future. That day, 
we walked 4\1/2\ miles, but the road to recovery stretches much longer, 
and we will keep walking together no matter how long it takes.
  As ``pule'' ``prayers'' were spoken and ``ho'okupu'' ``offerings'' 
offered by visiting canoes, we stood and walked side by side, equals in 
the pride we feel and hope we have for Lahaina.
  Next week marks the 6-month anniversary of the Maui fires. While it 
will be a solemn occasion, the miles that we have walked together 
remind us that though we have been tested, aloha will always win.

  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today to honor 
the life and legacy of an exemplary public servant and friend, Mr. 
Michael Joseph Reed, who passed away earlier this month.
  He spent nearly two decades advising my good friend and colleague, 
Mr. Sanford Bishop, until his retirement from public service.
  Michael was a shining example of dedication and service during his 
tenure on Capitol Hill, serving in many capacities to pass legislation 
and appropriations that benefited my great State and its citizens, as 
well as the United States of America.
  My wife, Vivien, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Michael's 
wife,

[[Page H377]]

Mrs. Diane Fields Reed, the entire Reed family, and the staff of 
Representative Bishop.
  Mr. Speaker, I will say this one last thing about Michael Reed. It 
didn't matter if you were a Democrat or Republican, especially a 
Democrat or Republican member of the staff. When you had a question 
about appropriations, it was Michael Reed that you called to get the 
straight answer. If he could help you, he would. He was one of the most 
dependable people I have met in my life.

   NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE 
                        PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE

  Ms. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of 
rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a 
question of the privileges of the House.
  The form of the resolution is as follows:
  Censuring Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
  Whereas, elected Members of Congress take an oath to ``bear true 
faith and allegiance'' to the United States, ``without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion'';
  Whereas, Representative Ilhan Omar took an oath of allegiance to the 
United States upon becoming a citizen, declaring, ``I absolutely and 
entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign 
prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have 
heretofore been a subject or citizen'';
  Whereas, on January 27, 2024, Representative Omar gave remarks at an 
event in Minneapolis in which she made treasonous statements;
  Whereas, Representative Omar said she has spoken to many Somalians 
who asked her to intercede for the Somali Government by pressuring the 
United States Government into certain actions;
  Whereas, Representative Omar assured the Somalians she spoke to, 
``the U.S. Government will only do what Somalians in the U.S. tell them 
to do. They will do what we want and nothing else. They must follow our 
orders and that is how we will safeguard the interest of Somalia.'';
  Whereas, Representative Omar continued, ``for as long as I am in the 
U.S. Congress, Somalia will never be in danger, its waters will not be 
stolen by Ethiopia or others. Sleep in comfort knowing I am here to 
protect the interests of Somalia from inside the U.S. system.'';
  Whereas, George Washington warned in his Farewell Address of 1796 to 
``Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism'', and further 
declared, ``Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that 
country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of 
American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always 
exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived 
from local discriminations'';
  Whereas, these statements by Representative Omar clearly violate the 
oath she took as an elected Member of Congress to defend and protect 
the United States Constitution;
  Whereas, Representative Omar has exhibited the treasonous tendencies 
George Washington warned about, and her actions must be condemned by 
all Members of Congress who adhere to the oath they took upon assuming 
office; and
  Whereas, by openly admitting her efforts to advance Somalia's 
interests using her position as a United States Representative, 
Representative Omar has revealed herself to be a foreign agent acting 
on behalf of a foreign government: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, that--
  One, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota be censured;
  Two, Representative Ilhan Omar forthwith present herself in the well 
of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure;
  Three, Representative Ilhan Omar be censured with the public reading 
of this resolution by the Speaker; and
  Four, Representative Ilhan Omar be, and is hereby, removed from the 
Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Education and the 
Workforce.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kiley). Under rule IX, a resolution 
offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or 
the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has 
immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 
legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed.

  Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the 
gentlewoman from Georgia will appear in the Record at this point.
  The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution 
constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at 
the time designated for consideration of the resolution.

                          ____________________

                     CLOSURE OF THE ST. CROIX AVIS

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Today, I honor the St. Croix Avis, our cherished 
newspaper, as it has concluded a remarkable 180-year journey leaving a 
legacy that is both historic and deeply rooted in our community.
  Established in 1844, the St. Croix Avis was a beacon of 
enlightenment. It laid the foundation for a literate Black population. 
The paper was Black owned and Black run, and symbolized not only the 
dissemination of information but also the affirmation of the dignity of 
voicing an opinion.
  Over the decades, the Avis has been more than a witness to history, 
it has been its scribe. From the era of chattel slavery to modern 
challenges, it has chronicled our evolution as a people and served as 
an invaluable source of information and engagement in our community.
  Let us remember the St. Croix Avis for the history it helped write 
and for the critical role it played in our community's growth and 
development.
  I thank Rena and her Dad, Mr. Brodhurst, and the previous owners. It 
will forever remain a cherished chapter in the story of the Virgin 
Islands and an enduring symbol of our Virgin Islands dignity and pride.

                          ____________________

                       WHY I OPPOSED THE TAX BILL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say that I was saddened to have 
to oppose the tax bill that the House of Representatives passed last 
evening. I could not, in good conscience, vote for a deal that so 
lopsidedly benefits big corporations while failing to ensure a 
substantial tax cut to middle and working-class families.
  I believe this deal is deeply inequitable, and at a time when we have 
seen the greatest rise in inequality when big corporations made super 
profits at the expense of the consumer, it is a mockery of whom 
representative government works for.
  This bill delivers massive tax cuts for the biggest corporations 
while denying middle-class families the economic security they had 
under the expanded monthly child tax credit that was passed in 2021.
  Let me be unequivocal. This is a reversal of the largest middle class 
tax cut in the history of the United States. This bill provides 
billions of dollars in tax relief for the wealthy and pennies for the 
poor. This expanded and improved child tax credit which we passed in 
2021 returns $8 for every dollar spent.
  How?
  Because the child tax credit helps children learn more, earn more, 
and grow up healthier, which is why I find it upsetting and appalling 
that we would condition a limited extension of this life-altering 
program with a vast giveaway to billionaires and corporations who are 
already well practiced in paying no taxes.
  DISH Network, FedEx, Salesforce, T-Mobile, and dozens of others--and 
I will later give you the list of the others, Mr. Speaker--these 
corporations and dozens of others paid no Federal income tax from 2018 
to 2020 under the Trump tax law.
  At a time when big corporations are richer than ever, the idea that 
we must evenly split the pot with working and

[[Page H378]]

middle-class families is absurd, but there is no even split in this 
bill. It is $5 for the corporations and $1 to our children.
  Understand, Mr. Speaker, people are calling this an expansion of the 
child tax credit. It is no expansion of the child tax credit. It is a 
step backward. That needs to be understood.
  When groceries and other costs like childcare have skyrocketed 
driving record corporate profits of $3 trillion in 2023, it was 
families bearing the brunt of inflation and high interest rates.
  The expanded monthly child tax credit is an antidote to child 
poverty, it is an antidote to inflation, and it is a successful tool 
that lifted millions and millions of children out of poverty virtually 
overnight. One-half of children in the United States were lifted out of 
poverty--4 million.
  Today, families live paycheck to paycheck. Their wages have not kept 
up with rising costs, the economy is not working for them, and to our 
great shame, it is children who will suffer the most.
  This bill fails to sufficiently improve the child tax credit. It 
leaves millions of middle-class families without a tax cut like they 
received in 2021. It keeps millions of children in preventable poverty 
because of a policy choice. This bill strips working-class families of 
the true economic security that was achieved with the expanded monthly 
child tax credit under the American Rescue Plan.
  I understand that no bill that can become law, especially in a 
divided government like we have today, is going to be perfect or have 
everything that we want.
  I am grateful for the hard work of Representatives Neal and Pelosi, 
Senators Bennet, Braun, Booker, and Wyden on the bill, and for the 
Members who spoke out and offered amendments to improve it, 
Representatives DelBene, Sanchez, and Moore--Congresswoman Moore is 
here today and will speak in short order--and Representative Sewell and 
Representative Doggett.
  An extension of the expanded monthly child tax credit is what our 
constituents need and deserve. It worked. It worked better than any 
other Federal program that we have seen. As I said, it lifted one-half 
of our children out of poverty and lowered the hunger rate in the 
United States by 26 percent.
  We lowered the child poverty rate, and today the rate has gone from 
5.2 percent to 12.4 percent, and, yes, working families, middle-class 
families, and vulnerable families have seen their wages decline as a 
result of pulling the rug out from under them with the expiration of 
the child tax credit.
  It is the one best thing we can do to improve economic well-being and 
secure the most vulnerable American families and to bring back the 
largest middle class tax cut in history. This was a lost opportunity. 
It leads the way to in 2025 making the Trump tax credits which 
benefited the richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this 
country and the biggest corporations in this country, it leads the way 
to moving in that direction. It can't go there. We have to stop that, 
and we have to make sure that we will.
  I look forward to continuing that fight to have an expanded and an 
improved child tax credit that we delivered for all families in 2021.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who 
will become the chair of the Education and Labor Committee come 2025.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her longtime commitment to 
the child tax credit. We know it works, and she has been the most 
dedicated advocate for the child tax credit that we have in the United 
States Congress today. I thank Rosa DeLauro.
  When congressional Democrats and President Biden enacted the American 
Rescue Plan in 2021 without a single Republican vote, we prioritized 
the economic well-being of working families with the expanded monthly 
child tax credit. The expanded child tax credit under the American 
Rescue Plan reached 61 million children and reduced child poverty by 
nearly one-half, lifting nearly 3 or 4 million children out of poverty.
  In contrast, this bill is expected to lift only 500,000 children out 
of poverty when it is fully phased in. So this is not an extension of 
the child tax credit that we passed in the American Rescue Plan. It is 
not as generous, it does not help the lowest income families, and 
unlike the ARP plan, there are no monthly checks. People do not pay 
their bills once a year. They pay them monthly. So the impact of this 
program will not nearly be as strong as the former child tax credit 
that we passed in the American Rescue Plan.
  So this deal fails to reinstate the economic gains made for working 
families, and it fails to come anywhere close to the reduction of child 
poverty achieved under the American Rescue Plan. While providing only 
$33 billion in benefits for children, this bill prioritizes $185 
million in tax cuts for corporations that were included in the 2017 
Trump tax scam.

                              {time}  1115

  It is overwhelmingly lopsided in favor of big corporations that are 
already paying historically low tax rates as a result of the Trump tax 
scam. What is even more egregious is that the bill makes the tax breaks 
for corporations and businesses retroactive and immediate, while not 
doing the same for working families. This doesn't make sense from 
either a budgetary or a public policy perspective, and is a bold 
display of misplaced priorities.
  It is notable that congressional Republicans sanctimoniously complain 
about the national debt and budget deficits.
  Earlier this month, Republicans on the House Budget Committee even 
passed the so-called Fiscal Commission Act because they were seemingly 
so concerned about the national debt and claim to want to do something 
about it, and yet, they consistently abandon all sense of fiscal 
responsibility when it comes to enacting corporate tax cuts.
  In fact, before the bill has even come to the floor, we just passed 
the tax cut last night costing about $200 billion that, when fully 
phased in over 10 years, will cost about $700 billion over the 10-year 
period.
  Mr. Speaker, ultimately, I voted ``no'' because this fiscally 
irresponsible tax deal is too lopsided in favor of corporations and 
special interests, while failing to provide equivalent support for 
working families.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Rosa DeLauro for her advocacy for the child tax 
credit and for families.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia because 
he is someone who has been an emphatic champion for education and for 
working people in this country, and as someone who is always at the 
forefront of what makes sense in terms of providing for the economic 
security of people in this country, and particularly in children.
  Mr. Speaker, he just hit the nail on the head that this is a question 
of just such gross inequity that is going to be foisted on our families 
and our children. The people who are standing up and talking about the 
expansion are just fooling themselves about what this bill is about. 
They need to take a look at who the beneficiaries are.
  Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Congressman Scott for his work now and 
what he has done in the past and what he will continue to do in the 
future in this body. I thank him so much for being here.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Congresswoman 
Gwen Moore, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee. She will talk 
about her amendment, which was defeated on a party-line vote, but she 
is someone who is never afraid to stand up and to speak out, and she 
did so last night on this floor in opposition to this lopsided tax 
deal.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. DeLauro for putting 
together this Special Order.
  Mr. Speaker, I felt really compelled to come to the floor because 1 
minute last night during the tax debate did not seem to be an adequate 
amount of time to explain why I adamantly opposed the tax bill in its 
current iteration.
  Mr. Speaker, what I have been told is that a half a loaf is just 
better than no loaf at all; that this tax bill was a compromise, and 
that somehow as a legislative body and as legislators, we ought to be 
used to compromising, but I just didn't want to capitulate.
  I didn't mind compromising, but I didn't want to capitulate. It 
wasn't

[[Page H379]]

just that we passed this tax bill that supposedly was an improvement 
for the child tax credit, but we passed $600 billion of tax breaks for 
businesses, which is the job of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what Members of this body have against poor 
children. Are we in some sort of Dickensian reality here, like in a 
novel by Charles Dickens, where 5-year-olds have to go to work to take 
care of themselves?
  Part of what is flawed about the so-called improvement in the child 
tax credit is that it relegates children's well-being and their ability 
to get a supplemental income based on their parent's income.
  If you are married and you are a stay-at-home mom and your husband 
makes $399,000 a year, I am happy that we provide you the full credit 
because, even at that income level, we ought to recognize the 
tremendous expense that it is to raise children. We ought to consider 
the benefits of providing shelter and good food and good nutrition for 
children, but why is it that those children in that home are more 
deserving of a supplement than a child who lives in a household where a 
parent makes less than $22,000 a year?
  Why?
  Why is it that this body perceives that the lowest income children 
living in those households, that their parents need to put in a greater 
work effort?
  Well, I asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to do a little 
arithmetic for me, so that I could sort of understand the thinking 
behind what my colleagues were saying. They said people need to work. 
Children need to see their parents going to work before they just get 
this welfare money and this free money.
  Well, under current law, if a single mom gets out there and gets 
herself a minimum wage job, doing her part, she is only required under 
our welfare policy to work 20 hours a week, but if she gets out there 
and finds herself two minimum wage jobs paying 7.25 an hour and she 
goes and does Uber or Instacart after she finishes her two part-time 
jobs, then and only then will she be eligible for the tax credit.
  I don't know who takes care of her kids while she is working more 
than 40 hours per week in order to qualify for the child tax credit. I 
mean, that is just criminal.
  As my colleagues have pointed out, in this same package, we have 
corporations that are getting stuff like research expensing. I think 
R&D is a legitimate tax break, but there is research expensing that can 
hardly be called ``research.''
  We also provide billions of dollars for bonus depreciation, which is 
really quite wasteful in our economy for companies to be able to buy 
new equipment year after year after year because they can expense it 
and write it off. And while they are able to write off their business 
expenses, we are writing off millions of children whose parents don't 
have tax liability.

  So companies can have no tax liability, pay no taxes, and get $600 
billion and parents, who have no tax liability, get nothing.
  Will the gentlewoman yield?
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin 
for the purpose of a colloquy.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. As a refundable tax credit, there are about 
61 million children who are able to benefit from this provision, and 
yet I see through all of the talking points and literature and analyses 
of this proposal, that we are just supposed to be happy with this half 
loaf because now 16 million kids and 400,000 more are going to benefit 
from this proposal.
  Is this correct?
  Ms. DeLAURO. First of all, the point that you have made and that 
Congressman Scott made, these tax breaks for the richest corporations, 
they are immediate. They are immediate.
  The child tax credit, this has to be phased in over a 3-year period 
of time, and it is a lower number than they had with the original 
expanded monthly child tax credit, which was $3,000 for kids between 6 
and 17, $3,600 for kids who are under 6.
  It is a lower credit, and then they phase it in in terms of 
refundability, and the most vulnerable kids are excluded altogether. It 
is astounding the inequity of all of that.
  Now, what we did with the child tax credit, which was in the American 
Rescue Plan, the monthly credit reached 61 million children.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Sixty-one million children?
  Ms. DeLAURO. Yes. There was about 4 million kids lifted out of 
poverty, almost half the kids in the U.S. lifted out of poverty.
  Now, what we are talking about in this tax deal is 400,000 kids they 
talk about being lifted out of poverty versus 4 million. Plus, the 60 
million that is made reference to is some piece of it at some portion 
in some time during this phase-in, et cetera, will be the beneficiary 
of a much lower tax credit. In addition to that, what people are saying 
is that we have expanded the child tax credit.
  Folks out there are going to believe that they are going to be 
getting what they got in 2021, and it is misinformation. It is just 
about trying to put a veneer on what has been done here in giving the 
biggest corporations, as Congressman Scott pointed out in this 3-year 
period, $185 billion versus $33 billion for the child tax credit.
  Give me the facts, and that is what we try to do. That is what we 
have tried to do in the last weeks since this proposal came out is give 
people the information, the accurate information about what is here. 
They are hiding it. They are hiding it. And you know what, as I said, 
it is an unbelievable missed opportunity.
  I have to say this: I was told when we first went forward on the 
child tax credit, I wanted it to be permanent. They said we can't do 
it. We can't afford permanence. I said 5 years. Can't do it. Can't 
afford it, 5 years. I said 3 years. Can't afford it. I said 1 year, and 
then they asked me would you support 1 year of expanded monthly child 
tax credit, and I said yes.
  As I mentioned earlier, the most successful Federal program that we 
have seen coming down the pike that met its mission in lifting kids out 
of poverty and providing families with economic security, helping them 
to deal with the cost-of-living effort.
  I was also told at that time: Rosa, we do it for a year, it is not 
going to go away. It is not going to go away. It went away. And the 
first opportunity that we had to restore the child tax credit, we 
failed.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. We pushed more kids into poverty.
  Ms. DeLAURO. That is right. The kids have gone back into poverty, and 
it is preventable, as you pointed out. This is preventable poverty. We 
know the answer and we have refused to take that answer and move 
forward on it. That is what happened here last night
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Will the gentlewoman yield?
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin 
for the purpose of a colloquy.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. As you mentioned, I had a proposal, a 
compromise.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Your amendment. Go for it.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. It was a compromise. It was not what I 
wanted. I wanted a fully refundable tax credit, but I was looking at 
our current work requirements for this tax credit and I said to 
myself--even though a work requirement really defies the whole purpose 
of a child supplement--if we were to compromise and had a work 
requirement, why would someone, who through no-fault of their own, 
finds themselves working for $7.25 an hour; they are subject to rules 
under our welfare reform protocols, under our TANF legislation, to work 
20 hours a week when they have young children.

  I had the Joint Committee on Taxation do an analysis and if a woman 
with two kids worked 20 hours a week, did everything that was expected 
of her, she still would not qualify for this tax credit.
  And if she wanted to get a fully refundable tax credit, she would 
have to neglect her children in order to do it. She would have to work 
more than 40 hours, Mr. Speaker, in order to qualify.
  That is slavery, you all. I mean, why are we continuing to cling to 
these old models of financing our economy and deciding that women, who 
by definition are typically single parents struggling to raise their 
kids, must work more than 40 hours in order to receive a benefit from 
their government?
  Why is that?
  What do they have against these poor children?

[[Page H380]]

  

  Ms. DeLAURO. You ask a very relevant question. We have seen 
Congressman Casar, Congressman Scott, yourself, we have seen it on this 
floor, the denigration of working families in this country. It is that 
they don't work. When we talked about the child tax credit, they said: 
Well, they are not going to go to work, that they are going to spend 
the money on drugs.
  And when we got the data of what happened in that 1 year, we found 
that women used the money for childcare so that they could go to work; 
that the money was used to buy food, to pay rent, to buy school 
supplies, to pay for healthcare, for a mortgage payment
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. For childcare.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Childcare was one of the biggest issues, because then it 
allowed people to go to work.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And it incentivized them to work.
  Ms. DeLAURO. That is right. It is because they wanted to denigrate 
working folks. They say these corporations and these folks are the 
richest one-tenth of 1 percent who cut coupons, that is the work. They 
exercise their fingers with scissors and cut coupons, or the 
corporations who deal with stock buybacks, that is okay. They are not 
held accountable, but by God, we are going to put it to people who are 
trying to make ends meet, trying to deal with the cost of living and 
inflation today. And that child tax credit helps them do that and we 
pulled the rug out from under them.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, my only proposal was to have a 
more generous phase-in.
  If you are going to require people to work, why not allow them to 
have 40 percent of the credit after the first $2,500 of income. That 
way, someone who was working and trying to meet all of the program 
requirements, a TANF recipient, could go to work and feel some 
dignity--as they claim that you get--some dignity going to work, making 
work pay.
  They go and do their 20 hours, and they are able to have time to deal 
with their children and help them with their homework.

                              {time}  1130

  They get the earned income tax credit. They are playing by the rules, 
and all we do is just move the goal post further and further away. 
Under this bill you cannot work your way out of poverty, and we are 
going to make sure you stay there.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. 
You hit all of the points on this. Look, you just said it, children and 
families with zero to $2,500 in earnings get nothing--get nothing. 
Corporations who have avoided any kind of a tax liability get 
everything that they ask for, and the business community and the 
corporations put the red lines down, and when we had our red lines, 
they got blurred, and we walked backward, and we gave them everything 
they wanted. We made it retroactive. We said go for it, take it--laying 
the groundwork for next year. We said we are going to skimp on this 
child tax credit and make sure that it doesn't reach all of those who 
need to be reached in order for us to turn poverty around in this 
country, which we proved that we could do.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Casar), who 
stood up yesterday on this floor and voted ``no'' on this tax deal last 
night. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his interest, for his 
progressive nature on this stuff, and for all of the issues that face 
working and middle-class families in this country and make this a more 
equitable society.
  Mr. CASAR. Mr. Speaker, I opposed the tax bill last night. To me it 
was pretty simple, because whether I am in Austin, Texas, or San 
Antonio, Texas, whether I am in a group of seniors or with young 
people, in front of more liberal constituents or conservative ones, one 
of the most common questions I get asked is: Why is it that I and 
everyday Americans pay such a higher effective tax rate than some of 
the biggest corporations in this country?
  How is it that FedEx and T-Mobile would pay none, zero, in Federal 
income tax at all?
  And the answer is: Look no further than the bill that we voted to 
pass last night, which provided tens of billions, if not hundreds of 
billions, in giveaways in corporate tax breaks.
  Importantly, as folks have noted, packaged into the bill is a watered 
down partial return of the child tax credit, which thankfully, will 
help thousands of families. But for every dollar going to kids in the 
bill, $5 goes to corporations.
  So in short, instead of helping thousands of kids, we could have 
helped millions of kids. We have the money to pull kids out of poverty, 
to ensure that people in this country are housed, fed, and educated. 
The money is there. In this case, the money was sitting right there in 
this bill--just in the wrong people's pockets.
  We have to be willing to move the money from corporate pockets over 
to kids and families. We could provide working-class and middle-class 
tax cuts. We just have to be willing to fight and negotiate harder to 
end the giveaways to billionaires.
  Mr. Speaker, just like the ranking member, I am open to compromise, 
but instead of a deal where corporations get $5 for every $1 that kids 
get, what about a compromise where kids get $5 for every dollar that 
corporations get?
  I oppose this bill because we can do so much better. It is such a 
missed opportunity. We have to be willing to say no to deals that are 
so lopsided that workers get crumbs while corporate executives get a 
full steak dinner.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has made such very good 
points. It is a missed opportunity. That is the regret in all of this.
  Again, I was told that you get it for a year, it is not going to go 
away. Well, not only did it go away, but it came back as a much watered 
down proposal. What is equally troubling is the number of people who 
are out there saying that this is an expansion. It really is 
doublespeak to the American people. It isn't an expansion. It is moving 
backward.
  The notion that half a loaf is better than none, something is better 
than nothing; we cannot afford that kind of a philosophy going forward. 
That is not our job. Our job is to advocate for the American people, 
for those working families, those middle-class families, those 
vulnerable families, for children. That is what we should do here. We 
have that obligation.
  When corporate profits have skyrocketed $3 trillion in 2023, how do 
we in good conscience say, amen, you get millions and millions of 
dollars in tax breaks? Your goal is to get to $600 billion. We cannot 
draw that line in the sand and say no.
  I believe in research and development--we all do--but the inequity 
that is built into this tax package is stunning. To use the words of my 
colleague from Wisconsin, it is a capitulation of saying amen, it is 
okay, and that we will fight another day. No, we had a moment to fight, 
and we missed that moment.

  We are not stopping. We are not stopping.
  I heard a lot of people last night say that: well, we will get to it 
next year, and we will get the child tax credit to where it was. You 
know, it was not just a mental note. I made a list of the folks who 
talked about getting us to where we need to be. Time flies. We are 
going to hold people to their words here.
  We heard that it is not ever going to be permanent. Well, we are 
going to hold you to that, as well. If we are going to make anything 
permanent, it has to be the child tax credit. It is the antidote to 
inflation. It allowed families to be able to achieve economic security 
that they had not seen in a generation because their wages haven't gone 
up in generations.
  That is what is on the minds of people today, how they are going to 
economically survive. We had that opportunity to give them that help.
  I don't put aside helping 400,000 kids, but we could have helped many 
millions of kids in what we call preventable poverty.
  We don't understand what our values are, who we are, why we are 
privileged to serve in this institution. We can look at public policy 
in a way that makes a difference for people.
  The great Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel laureate in economics, said 
that inequality is not because of globalization or modernization, but 
it is the public policy choices that we make.

[[Page H381]]

  Last night, this body made a public policy choice to continue the 
inequality and inequitable advantage that corporations have over their 
lives, their families' lives, their kids' lives.
  That is not the direction we are going in. We will continue the fight 
that we have started here. This now goes to the United States Senate, 
and let's just see how we can influence the process there. We will 
continue until there is a permanent child tax credit.
  What is important that has come out of this debate in the last 
several days is that we have raised the decibel level on a child tax 
credit, its success, and its future and its future as permanent for 
this country. We are going to keep it on that front burner, and we are 
not going to let it go.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott of Virginia, Congresswoman 
Gwen Moore, and Congressman Casar for being here this afternoon, and, 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                           ISSUES OF THE DAY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Loudermilk).
  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of someone who I 
believe is one of the best staff members in this institution--Mr. Tim 
Monahan.
  I first met Tim a few years ago during his tenure with the Committee 
on House Administration. As with me, Tim has left a lasting impression 
on many here in Congress.
  Anyone who has ever met Tim probably remembers their first impression 
of the Gettysburg neighbor who some refer to as a grizzly with a Philly 
charm.
  As you get to know Tim, you learn just how steadfast, generous, and 
kind he really is. He is the kind of person who can handle anything 
that is thrown his way, whether it be big feelings, awkward moments, 
and even the most outlandish member requests.
  Tim first started on the Hill at the Office of the CAO during Speaker 
Boehner's years where he learned the nuts and bolts of our institution.
  Later serving on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, 
Tim deepened his institutional relationship while ensuring his work was 
for the greater benefit of the House.
  He joined ranking member Rodney Davis at the Committee on House 
Administration at the beginning of the 116th Congress where his natural 
leadership skills quickly stood out, and he was soon appointed staff 
director for the committee.
  In 2023, Tim took over the House operations for Speaker Kevin 
McCarthy where he remained a steady hand during several unprecedented 
moments, including staying on through the transitions of Speaker pro 
tempore McHenry and now-Speaker Mike Johnson.
  So much could be said about Tim's dedication to our institution and 
the people working here. I could talk about his vital role in reopening 
the House post-pandemic, his conflict resolution skills, his role in 
the first House filibuster, his helping Congressman Davis carry 
Representative Wright to safety on January 6, 2021, staffing a historic 
15 rounds of votes for the Speaker of the House, his mentorship and 
leadership for the past 15 years, or his deep, resolute patriotism.
  Tim possesses an honor and respect for the halls of Congress that is 
admired by many. He gets to know and cares about all of those who work 
within its walls and works hard to ensure that our Capitol remains a 
functional beacon of our constitutional Republic. Tim's legacy in the 
House will be his strong character and his servant leadership.
  Everyone who knows Tim is better for it. As he prepares to leave the 
House, our institution is better, thanks to his service.
  Tim, we wish you all the best in this next chapter of your life. 
Hopefully your departure from the House will allow more time with your 
lovely wife, Marissa; your baby daughter, Marian; and your puppy, 
Bella.
  Some of the staffers you have worked with have had some parting 
wishes for you. We hope the soup is plentiful in the next cafeteria, 
the nuts are absent, and that you have more time to listen to JLo and 
dream of Tiger Woods' comebacks.
  Please, they said, if you ever try the grocery store sushi, Pringles, 
and kombucha combo again, please don't share.
  To me, Tim has been not only a great member of the House staff, but 
he has been a close confidante and a good friend.
  He has been instrumental in helping me with some of the greatest 
moments in my tenure as a Member of Congress, but he has also helped me 
through some of the most difficult times. Tim Monahan is the gold 
standard of this institution, and more should aspire to be like him.
  Tim, we will miss you. God bless you.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to comment on a variety of 
things. Like always, I like to use this time to bring the Chair's 
attention to stories that I don't feel our mainstream media is doing an 
adequate job of covering.
  A couple comments before I delve into these five stories. First of 
all, Congressman Loudermilk gave a shout-out to one of his staffers who 
is leaving.
  This will be the final week that Kyle Amato of my office will be 
working for me, and I thank him publicly for the great job he does, 
particularly putting out the newsletters that everyone around the 6th 
Congressional District of Wisconsin likes.
  The second thing I would like to do is I really didn't care for the 
form of the child tax credit that has been discussed so much today, but 
I thank the people for putting it together for this one reason.
  Normally around here when we pass legislation designed to benefit the 
children, we leave out the children of what I will call the working 
middle class.
  In other words, if you are hardly working at all, certainly if there 
is not a man in the house, this institution gives more and more 
benefits to people of that demographic.
  We did something the other day, which is almost unheard of. We 
extended those benefits to the middle class.
  While there are certainly problems with the way it is laid out, if 
you are a married couple making 120 grand a year and have a couple 
kids, you are going to get the child credits just as you would if you 
weren't working at all. Small favors, but I would like to point that 
out.
  Now, the first issue that I don't think has been adequately addressed 
around here is there has been, I think, misinformation spread on the 
conflict between Israel and Hamas or Israel and Gaza.
  We are supposed to be very sensitive and say Hamas is one group and 
Gaza is another group; but, in fact, Hamas--at least the polls show--is 
wildly popular in the West Bank and also, of course, popular in Gaza; 
and Gaza elected Hamas.

  I think too many people feel it is a historical conflict, and, in a 
way, we heard this in a speech from a prominent American earlier today.
  They are kind of treated as two sides of the same coin. In fact, that 
is not true, and I would like to talk a little bit more about how the 
people in Gaza should be so lucky, so grateful--realize how lucky and 
grateful they are that they are living so close to Israel.
  There are far too many Americans in general, and congressmen in 
particular, who define this conflict as between two sides apparently 
equal or close to equal.
  In fact, Gaza has been treated incredibly fairly and generously by 
Israel. When Gaza was set up as kind of an independent--I don't know 
what you would call it--principality a while ago, the Israelis removed 
the Jewish temples from the area despite the fact that in Israel 
proper, there are 400 Muslim mosques.
  In Gaza, Israel felt, well, okay, if they don't want them, they 
shouldn't have to put up with temples in that area.
  Not only that, they physically removed Israelis who were living in 
Gaza. Maybe you remember this. They physically grabbed and removed them 
from Gaza to the rest of Israel.

[[Page H382]]

  Apparently, the Gazans did not have to put up with Jews living in 
Gaza. That was bending over backward. It was almost barbaric.
  Then Gazans were able to work in Israel. Israel is a wildly 
successful Western country on the Mediterranean. As a result, I think 
the second biggest source of revenue for people in Gaza was working in 
businesses in Israel.
  That is their major source of income, along with foreign welfare that 
they didn't work for at all. It largely comes from Europe.
  When Gaza was set up as an independent or somewhat independent 
principality, they were given greenhouses so they could take over those 
businesses and make money.
  Of course, the Palestinians on their own destroyed the greenhouses 
because they didn't want to accept something that was tainted by 
previously being Jewish businesses, which is kind of offensive. I don't 
think the public really knows that.
  I think one way you can tell whether you are put upon and have things 
tough or whether you have things easy is other people want to be like 
you, or people are running away from you.
  Already, at the time of the barbaric acts in October, there were over 
10,000 people from Thailand living in Israel and working in Israel. In 
other words, they came halfway around the globe from Thailand to Israel 
to work in Israel.
  At first, I was kind of stumped when they said that Thai nationals 
were killed by Hamas in Israel or Thai nationals were taken hostage in 
Israel.
  I thought what in the world are people from Thailand doing in Israel. 
Actually, they knew it was so wonderful working in Israel that they 
came halfway around the globe to work there.
  As a practical matter now, since Israel can no longer trust the 
Palestinians, those jobs are going to be opened up to people around the 
world.
  Not enough people know that, right; be they people from India--which 
is a booming country in its own right--Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Kenya, 
Malawi.
  They are coming from around the world to replace the Palestinian 
workers who are fortunate enough to have jobs in Israel.
  By the way, those Gaza citizens who worked in Israel were making far 
more money than your average person in the Arab world is making. They 
just lucked out that they were near enough to Israel, and they could 
grab these good jobs.
  Now that they kicked them away by killing so many Israelis, they are 
going to be replaced by other people all around the world.
  One thing that I think has not been publicized anywhere near enough 
is there are talks of 25,000 people from Ecuador who may come to Israel 
to work.
  Think about that. The Gazans think they are so put upon that they 
have to kill the Israelis, chop off their heads, chop off the heads of 
children, and, meanwhile, people in Ecuador are coming halfway around 
the world with possible plans of taking 25,000 Ecuadorians to live in 
Israel and take those jobs.
  That is something that every American should know. They don't know it 
because the American press is not covering it.
  They are allowing people to believe, oh, those poor Gazans. They 
don't realize that people from Thailand or Ecuador or the southern part 
of Africa would move halfway around the world--goodbye to their 
families--to be in heaven, to work in Israel.

  By the way, there is another item that ought to be pointed out with 
regard to how well the Arabs in Israel have it.
  Not long ago, there were efforts made for a two-State solution. Bad 
idea, but, nevertheless, they talked about doing it.
  At the time when they talked about it, they thought okay, in this 
area of land we call Israel, we are going to have some of that land be 
Israel and some of that land be Palestine.
  So people don't have to be offended, the Israelis living in what 
would become Palestine would move to Israel, and the Palestinians 
living in what would become Israel will move to Palestine.
  It seemed at first blush kind of a commonsense thing. You know who 
screamed bloody murder? The Palestinians who were going to have to move 
to Palestine and leave Israel because when push came to shove, they 
know that their children would be a lot freer, get a lot better 
education, and be a lot more economically well off living in Israel 
than they would in Palestine.
  Palestine would probably become another State like Gaza, kind of a 
crooked State in which whatever leadership they vote for takes the 
foreign aid and keeps it.
  By the way, some of you older people--I don't know how old the Chair 
is--remember Yasser Arafat who many, many years ago was running Gaza.
  Apparently his ancestors now, they got out. They are living in Paris. 
They don't want to live in Gaza. They are living in Paris high on the 
hog with all the money that Yasser Arafat managed to make off the 
foreign aid the West was sending to Gaza.

                              {time}  1215

  In any event, I would ask the press to report a little bit about 
these land swaps--even that is kind of an old story--and in a new 
story, point out all the people from around the world who would like to 
live in Israel and replace the Palestinians who kicked away the great 
jobs that they had in Gaza, and particularly pay attention to what is 
going on in Ecuador and how many people from Ecuador are going to come 
halfway around the world to be grateful to have the jobs that the 
Palestinians kicked away who were living in Gaza at this time on the 
beautiful Mediterranean Sea.
  Now, the next thing I want to talk about, and I don't think has been 
adequately addressed, we reported on the tax bill yesterday. I am not 
sure you could call it a major bill. There were good things in the bill 
and bad things in the bill, as you can imagine, because it was part of 
negotiations between Republicans and Democrats.
  As I mentioned, the child tax credits probably have an element of 
welfare in them, which is bad. On the other hand, they did go to the 
middle class, which is one of the few things that we don't phase out 
and say because you are making $60,000 a year, we are going to take 
them away from you and punish you for working, or punish you for 
getting married.
  There was another provision in there that I really disliked, even 
though I voted for the bill, because overall, the positives outweighed 
the negatives, but it is a provision that was only in there because the 
press corps does not highlight it; that is, low-income housing tax 
credits. It is a little bit of a boring topic, but I ask the Chair to 
indulge me a little bit.
  There are a variety of ways in which the Federal Government--it is 
none of their business to do it, by the way--in which the Federal 
Government tries to provide low-income housing for people. One is by 
giving a low-income housing tax credit to property developers of low-
income housing.
  We tweaked that credit for only a 2-year period and only a certain 
subset of that credit yesterday in the bill. The press corps ought to 
talk a little bit about these credits, because I don't think that they 
would survive the light of day, or survive appropriate attention by the 
mainstream media.
  My problem with them is in addition to my problem with all Federal 
mucking around in low-income housing, particularly low-income housing 
that is not for the elderly. For the elderly, I guess I can say 
positive things for it. For the disabled, I can say positive things 
about it.
  The low-income housing tax credit means that when the Federal 
Government gets involved, a huge beneficiary is, quite frankly, well-
off property developers. So you understand what happens, when 
developers take advantage of low-income housing tax credits, they get a 
credit equal to 9 percent of the total cost for a 10-year period. 
Because there is a time value of money, it means that when they build 
low-income housing, the government pays for 70 percent.
  In other words, if I am a well-off property housing developer, the 
government gives me 70 percent of the cost of that building and I only 
have to put in 30 percent, at a minimum. There are, I am told, places 
around the country where the States and local governments give them 
further incentives.
  I think a lot of these people, by the way, make campaign 
contributions. I think they are politically well-connected, as you can 
imagine, to take advantage of such a generous credit.

[[Page H383]]

  In any event, it is a very complicated thing. You might say what 
happens if the property developer does not have income tax to offset 
with the credit. What happens is, then they sell the credits to 
somebody else, frequently banks. We not only have beneficiaries of what 
is supposed to help with the low-income people go to an incredibly 
generous subsidy to property developers, but banks are able to use the 
credit to show the FDIC, or whoever, the banking regulators, that they 
are socially conscious, so they get a little bit of a benefit there as 
well.
  There are some anecdotes I have heard about this--by the way, an 
accounting firm puts out an explanation of the tax credit. The tax 
credit by itself kind of makes your eyes glaze over. People wonder 
where paperwork comes from. The accounting firm that puts it out 
devotes 1,400 pages to an explanation for a credit. Even if there are 
other things you like, you should know if Congress is passing a program 
that takes 1,400 pages to explain, you know it is a bad program.
  I think, by the way, it is complicated on purpose so you confuse 
Congressmen into voting for it. Because the government, not surprising, 
is paying for 70 percent of the cost of that apartment, that apartment, 
in general, costs 30 percent more than an apartment would if it was 
built in the private sector without having the government muck around. 
Right off the bat, there is a big problem there.
  I know a property developer in Wisconsin who builds normal 
apartments, not aimed for low-income housing, not taking advantage of 
the generous credit. He tells me that the people with the low-income 
housing credit frequently outbid him for the land, because the 
government is paying for 70 percent of the cost. Think about that. If 
you want somebody to build apartments for the middle class, they can't 
get the prime location in town because the low-income credit is so 
generous that the person with the low-income housing will always outbid 
them.
  Another thing that happens when the government pays 70 percent of the 
cost of something, you have a nicer apartment--because after 20 years 
it is no longer low-income housing--a nicer apartment than people who 
don't have low-income housing have. I have heard that complaint. I have 
heard people looking for new apartments, and they find the nicest 
apartments in town they are not eligible for because they are the low-
income housing units. That is what happens when the government pays for 
70 percent of the cost of the unit. Not to mention, there is the 
possibility for crookedness there, because if the government is paying 
70 percent of the cost of anything, doesn't it encourage your 
subcontractors to jack up the prices because the government is paying 
for 70 percent? Of course it does.

  Now, this new increase in generosity in the low-income housing credit 
will expire in 2 years. They were able to get this thing through 
because naive people, first of all, thought it was the Federal 
Government's business to get involved at all, but nice people felt that 
the low-income housing tax credit benefited low-income people. They 
didn't realize it was a payoff to well-connected property developers.
  If the press corps would wake up and write articles about this 
program, it would not survive the next 3 or 4 years. The only reason 
this program, which I consider to be about the most questionable part 
of the Internal Revenue Code--the only reason this thing is able to 
survive is because the slumbering press corps does not report on it.
  Now, there are a lot of programs on it. I don't like to highlight one 
nonprofit, but the Cato Institute has a great expose about this program 
out there, if you want to find it on the internet. It is about 5 years 
old, but it is as accurate today as it was then. If you think the 
Internal Revenue Code is used by well-heeled people to get things in 
there, this is for you.
  I strongly encourage the press corps to pay attention to the low-
income housing tax credits. Like I said, it is a waste of taxpayer 
money. I am the type of Congressman who tries to look out for the 
average guy. These are provisions stuck in the Internal Revenue Code to 
benefit the well-off, the politically well-connected. Just because they 
put kind of a nice-sounding title to it, ``low-income housing tax 
credit,'' you think they are looking out for the poor. They are looking 
out for the well-heeled property developer. That is the second thing 
that our slumbering press corps should pay attention to.
  The third thing I want to talk about is an issue we have talked about 
many times before, but since I last addressed the Chair, we released 
the figures on the number of people coming across the border.
  Now, I had guessed the last time I was up here that for the first 
time ever we would have over 300,000 people a month crossing the 
border. I remind people that back in the days of President Trump, that 
number was, depending on the month, around 10,000 or 12,000. We have 
gone from 10,000 or 12,000 people a month crossing our border what I 
will call illegally--because I think they are asking for asylum they 
don't deserve--from 10,000 or 12,000 to--this is just shocking; 
whenever I look at it, I can't believe it--370,000. We have gone up 
about 30 times as many people crossing into the United States as we did 
3 years ago.
  The American public ought to be absolutely appalled. We have an 
administration with Joe Biden, who fumbles around and says: Well, I 
guess maybe we should do something about that. Maybe Congress should 
meet with me, and we should try to do something.
  The American public should know, the fact that we have gone up from 
12,000 to 370,000 has nothing to do with Congress; it is the inability 
of the Biden administration to want to enforce the law. This is 
something they want by design. Instead of 12,000 people coming here 
illegally every month, they want 370,000. If they went back to the 
policies of President Trump, the stay-in-Mexico situation, we would 
reduce this number by 85 percent.
  Now, it would still be over 50,000. We still have more work to do. It 
would still be a disaster. Just by the signing of a piece of paper, he 
could knock that 370,000 figure back down to 40,000 or 50,000.
  Pointing out other things that are going on that the mainstream media 
is not doing a very good job on. In the 370,000, there were about, one 
more time, 12,000 unaccompanied minors. There is another thing that has 
gone up exponentially under this administration.
  The mainstream media purports to care when families are separated. I 
will tell you, when you have 12,000 people cross the border without 
their parents, that is family separation. Those kids should be turned 
around and sent back to their parents or contact their parents. Now, we 
don't do anything like that at all. If the child shows up and they have 
got a piece of paper on their T-shirt that says ``deliver me to Uncle 
Joe in Portland, Oregon,'' we buy them the plane ticket, we deliver 
them to Uncle Joe. We don't do DNA testing to see if it really is Uncle 
Joe. It is a recipe for human trafficking when people want to take 
advantage of young children, but the press allows it to happen.
  Under President Trump, they screamed about family separation when it 
was only a very temporary thing for a very small number of kids. Now, 
you have 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 kids a month, no big deal. We don't 
talk about it.
  The next thing to remember is that even once these kids are placed 
with sponsors, the Biden administration does not follow up to see where 
they are. Estimates vary, but somehow, I think somewhere between 30,000 
and 80,000 kids we have lost track of. In other words, we have let 15-
year-olds, 14-year-olds, and 12-year-olds in the country, and after a 
few months, we don't even know where they are.
  I would strongly encourage the press corps to report on the volume of 
people who came here in December. Even I, as opposed to the Biden 
administration as anybody, was expecting that number to come in 
310,000, 320,000. Instead, it is 370,000. They blew away the old record 
by about 50,000, more than I ever would have dreamed.
  We have to remember, in addition to all the people coming into our 
country, changing our country, committing crimes in our country, in 
addition to that, we have a situation in which they are bringing drugs 
in the country. We have to remember that over 100,000 of our citizens 
are dying every year from illegal drug overdoses.
  I know there are some hardhearted people who say: They took the drugs

[[Page H384]]

themselves; we don't care. Apparently, the Biden administration is in 
that category, because they don't do much to stop it. You would think 
any normal President, just to save the 100,000 lives and prevent all of 
these drugs from coming into our country, would close the border on 
that alone. The press, again, does not report it.

                              {time}  1215

  I was old enough to remember the Vietnam war. In 12 years in the 
Vietnam war, 57,000 American troops died, and it was reported 
constantly and should have been reported constantly. That was news when 
our troops were dying in Vietnam, 57,000 over 12 years.
  Now, we have 108,000, every year, dying from illegal drug overdoses. 
It happens in county after county, and it is swept under the rug 
because the mainstream media doesn't want to embarrass the Biden 
administration, so we don't talk about 108,000 people a year dying.
  Of course, is there any effort made to close the border or any effort 
made to prevent it? No. No effort is made to prevent it.
  It is a story that every local newspaper in the country--they are 
easy to find--ought to be reporting, not only the number for America as 
a whole; they ought to be pointing out how many people died, say, in 
the State of Wisconsin, or whatever State their paper is sent. They 
should be reporting how many people are dying in the county.
  You will find out, I would think, for almost every county in the 
country, probably every county in the State, if you added up all the 
murders and all the car accidents together, the number of people who 
are dying of illegal drugs is way over that total. We put car accidents 
with fatalities in the paper all the time because it is a tragic thing; 
people like to read about it or want to be informed about it. We 
obviously put local murders in the paper all the time.
  There are 108,000 Americans dying every year with spouses, with 
parents, with children. Let's sweep it under the rug, says the 
mainstream media. I will tell you, if you put that in there, people 
would pay attention to those stories.
  The next issue that I don't think has been covered enough and I will 
talk about more next week, but we had one more committee hearing in my 
subcommittee on wokeness in the military.
  Our current General Brown, who was previously head of the Air Force 
and is now head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prior to coming in the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly said he wanted to reduce the number of 
officers in the military from 67 percent White men down to 43 percent 
White men.
  I walk around my district, and I ask average people. I said: Do you 
know the most important member of the military in the country has said 
his public goal is to reduce the number of White officers in the 
military from 67 percent to 43 percent? Almost nobody knows. The rest 
of the people are shocked.
  I told this to a Vietnam veteran who fought in Vietnam. I thought he 
was going to break down and cry right there when he found out what was 
happening to our military. They have taken the single most important 
agency in the United States, and they run it like it is some stupid 
community college, where it doesn't matter who we promote, where we 
don't have to pay attention to merit. Who cares? I can go to a cocktail 
party and brag about how many Hispanics or how many Asians or how many 
Native Americans are in the military. I no longer brag about how good 
my military is or how strong it is. I brag about how diverse it is.
  The press does not know what is going on here. In my committee, there 
were inferences that we also were playing games with who gets into our 
military academies--West Point, Air Force Academy, Annapolis. I 
nominate those people, like all Congressmen do every year, but the 
testimony was they are putting a thumb on the scale as to who gets into 
them.
  It is just offensive. It mirrors what is going on in other parts of 
the country.
  They pay people $190,000 a year to be diversity experts, to say: Oh, 
this person is registered as this, this person is registered to that. I 
believe, when they do it, they do it like they do in the private sector 
and have been doing this for 50 years. You self-identify, so we keep 
this fiction going that, if you are one-quarter Peruvian, that you are 
a protected minority and you bring a diverse view of the world.
  I don't know why, if somebody has a grandmother who is Peruvian and 
grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, you have a unique view of the world 
and it is important to give you preferences to get a promotion in the 
military, but that is apparently how we are operating right now. In any 
event, all of the American public should be aware of that.
  If our military is not number one in the world, we are going to be in 
big trouble, baby. One of the only reasons why we are number one in the 
world is because we do have the strongest military in the world, and to 
begin to say our promotions should no longer be based on merit but 
should be based on looking around and finding somebody from--I don't 
know--South Africa or whatever is preposterous.
  Now, I will remind the Chair one more time that we are adding a new 
minority group to be given preferences right now. President Biden wants 
North Africans and Middle Eastern people--people, if you draw a line 
from Morocco all the way to Iran, he wants them considered as a special 
group who is in need of protection, as well. This will mean that if 
somebody emigrates here from, say, Egypt, and President Biden gets what 
he wants, they will also be considered a special case, in need of 
special protection, and being given preference over the native born.
  It is so divisive. Not only do you not have the best people 
necessarily getting the job, but it is so divisive because you are 
teaching our military--rather than you are one, we are all one unit, we 
are all American, you are taking the military and saying: You should 
walk around with a chip on your shoulder. You are a Hispanic American, 
you are an African American, you are a Native American, you are an 
Asian American, you are a Middle Eastern American, and it is just the 
beginning of the end.
  I strongly hope, when we come to the appropriations bill--and we made 
some progress--not as much progress as we wanted in the authorizing 
bill, but I hope that our team, when it comes to the appropriations 
bill, removes all of these horrible DPI positions.

  Our military, a lot of people tell us it is underfunded. I am not 
sure that is true, but people tell us that. To pay 190 grand a year for 
these people is, quite frankly, ridiculous, and it is something that 
should be reported in the mainstream media.
  My fifth story that we are going to cover today that the mainstream 
media is not going to pay attention to is we had a prayer breakfast 
earlier this morning in the Capitol. In the past, we had that prayer 
breakfast outside the Capitol. We would take a bus a mile away or rent 
something in a hotel. Today, we did it right here in the Capitol, which 
is fine, saved a few bucks; that was good. President Biden came over, 
gave a little speech, which was good.
  In any event, the main speaker was the Chaplain of the Senate, and 
the Chaplain of the Senate was very animated, gave quite a long sermon. 
However, it was an interesting sermon, because I believe he called for 
a fast of all Americans of once or twice a week. It wasn't a full fast. 
I mean, you could drink water. The fast would end every day at 3 
o'clock.
  Nevertheless, I thought it was interesting that Reverend Black from 
the U.S. Senate, who claimed there are a lot of Senators or Members of 
the Senate--I think maybe he was mentioning staff, too--who fasted 
frequently. Of course, he quoted several Bible verses in both the Old 
and New Testament in which the Israelis fasted. Jesus' disciples, after 
he left, were going to fast.
  I thought it was interesting that we had such a student of the Bible, 
the Chaplain of the Senate, who has been here since 2003 that was 
calling for a fast.
  I think it is something interesting and ought to be in your local 
newspaper if you want to know what is going on around here. I mean, it 
was a prayer breakfast. A significant number of U.S. Senators and 
Congressmen attended. The President of the United States attended. 
Wouldn't you think they would cover it?
  I bet, if I look in the mainstream newspapers tomorrow--the 
Washington Post, the New York Times, et cetera,

[[Page H385]]

the Milwaukee Journal in my area--they will not cover the fact that the 
longtime Chaplain in the U.S. Senate called for a fast.
  So those are five stories that have been underreported. We will ask, 
if there are any members of the mainstream media that we see, whether 
their newspapers covered them. If the stories are even a little bit 
old, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be in there.
  To me, if you are a mainstream newspaper, a citizen who reads you 
every day should be informed, and every one of these five issues, I 
think somebody who reads the Washington Post; the Philadelphia 
Inquirer, if that is still around; the Milwaukee Journal, would not 
know these five issues.
  I am going to go through them again:
  The degree to which people all around the world are looking to 
replace these Palestinians as far as doing work in Israel.
  The horribleness, the waste of the low-income housing tax credits 
which would not survive the mainstream media paying attention to it.
  What is going on at the border, the degree to which, in December, we 
just blew away any previous totals of people coming across there, and 
the degree that we have to do something.
  The wokeness in the military--that is the fourth issue--the degree to 
which the current head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is overtly saying 
that he does not want the best people running the military if they 
happen to be White.
  Also, that the Chaplain of the Senate was such a Bible-believing guy 
that he called on the Congressmen and Senators who were there today to 
begin to fast, and he actually told us that a lot of the U.S. Senators 
are already fasting.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

IMPOSING CERTAIN SANCTIONS ON PERSONS UNDERMINING PEACE, SECURITY, AND 
 STABILITY IN THE WEST BANK--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
                      STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-102)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), section 212(f) and section 215(a) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 8 U.S.C. 1185(a)), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report that I have 
issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to deal with 
the threat posed by the situation in the West Bank, including in 
particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced 
displacement of people and villages, and property destruction. Such 
actions constitute a serious threat to the peace, security, and 
stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle 
East region and undermine the foreign policy and national security 
objectives of the United States. I find that these actions constitute 
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, and I have declared a national 
emergency to deal with that threat.
  The order authorizes the blocking of property and interests in 
property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
  (i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or 
indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions--including 
directing, enacting, implementing, enforcing, or failing to enforce 
policies--that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West 
Bank;
  (ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or 
indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, planning, ordering, 
otherwise directing, or participating in certain actions--including 
acts of violence or threats of violence targeting civilians, efforts to 
place civilians in reasonable fear of violence, property destruction, 
or seizure or dispossession of property by private actors--affecting 
the West Bank;
  (iii) to be or have been a leader or official of certain entities 
that have engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, such 
activities;
  (iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, any person blocked pursuant to the order; or
  (v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person blocked 
pursuant to the order.
  The order also authorizes the blocking of property and interests in 
property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to have committed or 
have attempted to commit, to pose a significant risk of committing, or 
to have participated in training to commit acts of terrorism affecting 
the West Bank. In addition, the order suspends the entry into the 
United States of any noncitizen determined to meet one or more of the 
above criteria.
  The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the 
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted 
to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes 
of the order. It directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, to implement the order as it 
applies to visas, and it directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to implement the order as it 
applies to the entry into the United States of noncitizens. All 
executive departments and agencies of the United States are directed to 
take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement the 
order.
  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, February 1, 2024.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is not often that the U.S. Senate is 
called to act on a multitude of national security issues all at the 
same time. But right now, that is precisely the task at hand.
  Vladimir Putin has waged war against Ukraine and against Western 
democracy for nearly 2 years. Israel suffered its bloodiest day last 
fall at the hands of the terror group Hamas, and millions of innocent 
Gaza civilians are in desperate need of aid. The Chinese Communist 
Party threatens to increase tensions in the Indo-Pacific. And our 
southern border is in urgent need--in urgent need--of fixing.
  These are daunting challenges. They are time-sensitive challenges. 
And in the era of divided government, the only way--let me repeat--the 
only way to pass a national security supplemental is through 
bipartisanship--bipartisanship.
  Over the course of this week, Democrats and Republicans have 
continued serious negotiations on the supplemental package. But there 
are still some pieces remaining to be settled.
  Democrats have been exceedingly clear that we are willing to treat 
these negotiations with the seriousness they deserve. We have worked 
with Republicans on border security and on a vast range of issues and 
on coming to an agreement, and we want to finish the job.
  The negotiators' tasks have not been easy because the more progress 
they make, the louder voices get on the outside who want to kill these 
negotiations in their tracks. There are always going to be some who 
prefer to exploit the issue of the border instead of fixing it. So the 
real question is whether Senators can tune all of that noise out and 
focus on reaching an agreement. Opportunities like this one are 
extremely rare when it comes to border security, so we owe it to the 
American people to seize this opportunity, and that is what Democrats 
want to do.
  Senate Democrats remain committed to seeing this bipartisan process 
through. For the sake of our friends in Ukraine, for the sake of 
security on our border, for the sake of the future of Western democracy 
in the 21st century, we will keep working to get the job done.

                              The Economy

  On the economy, Mr. President, the reports are in, the results are 
clear: Americans are feeling better and better about where the economy 
is headed under President Biden and congressional Democratic 
leadership. When

[[Page S326]]

you pass an ambitious agenda like the ones Democrats have passed under 
President Biden, it can take some time for the effects to take hold. 
But now we are starting to see these benefits gain momentum.
  Americans are starting to notice. As a Washington Post headline read 
this week:

       Falling inflation, rising growth give the United States the 
     world's best recovery.

  American citizens have noticed. The University of Michigan shows that 
consumer sentiment surged by nearly 30 percent over the last 2 months--
the biggest 2-month increase in over 30 years.
  Earlier this week, another survey by The Conference Board showed 
American consumers are more optimistic about the economy today than 
they have been in over 2 years. Let me say that again. According to a 
new survey by The Conference Board--very well-respected--American 
consumers are more optimistic about the economy today than they have 
been over the past 2 years.
  The chief economist at The Conference Board credited the surge in 
consumer optimism to ``slower inflation'' and ``favorable employment 
conditions.''
  Look, a year and a half ago, when Democrats passed legislation 
investing in the American people, like the Inflation Reduction Act, the 
hard right predicted America would sink into recession. Instead, the 
opposite has happened. Jobs are up, the economy is up, wages are up, 
and inflation has cooled down. None of this happened on its own. It is 
a result of Democrats choosing to invest in infrastructure, invest in 
manufacturing and scientific innovation, lowering prescription drug 
costs, and more.
  We are seeing big progress across the country. One year ago this 
week, I stood with President Biden to announce historic investment in 
one of the most important infrastructure projects in the country--the 
Gateway Tunnel. Just this morning, we learned that manufacturing 
investments--something that has plagued America for quite a while--is 
near an alltime high, more than double its highest point during the 
previous administration.
  Look, Republicans know the Democratic agenda is working. It is why so 
many Republicans in Congress are openly taking credit for our 
achievements. All over the country, you see Republicans bragging about 
projects and jobs that they actually voted against in Congress. The 
hard right knows they have no real agenda to tout. As one Texas 
Congressman said on the House floor:

       I want my Republicans colleagues to give me one thing--
     one--that I can go campaign on and say we did.

  Unfortunately, this Republican Congressman, his options are slim 
because they don't have much to tell the American people about that 
they did that was good.
  Without real accomplishments on their own, the hard right is trying 
to take credit for the things Democrats are doing. It is laughable. And 
the American people, frankly, aren't falling for it.
  So make no mistake. We still have a long way to go to make our 
economy more productive. But Americans can rest assured that under 
President Biden and congressional Democrats, we are on the right track.
  I yield the floor.

                           National Security

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the People's Republic of China is the 
single greatest strategic challenge facing the United States. It poses 
a potentially existential threat to our friends in the region and a 
growing threat to our allies in Europe as well.
  The PRC is working to undermine the prevailing order that has 
maintained a major power piece for eight decades. It is useful to think 
about this challenge from our adversary's position.
  President Xi aims to expand China's influence at our expense, to 
rewrite the rules of the road, and to dominate his neighbors. Each of 
these tasks becomes easier the more the West is distracted, divided, 
and deterred. And depending on the choices America and our allies make, 
our adversaries may succeed without even trying.
  Are we distracted? Ask Beijing what it thinks about the Western 
diplomatic energy expended on unenforceable climate mandates while 
Chinese industry accelerates its carbon emissions. Our adversaries must 
scratch their heads at some of the things about which Western leaders 
obsess.
  Are we divided? The PRC clearly hopes that the West's shared values 
are not as strong as our adversaries' shared disdain for them. Beijing 
no doubt enjoys watching the United States abandon allies in 
Afghanistan, second-guess allies in Israel, and initiate trade fights 
with its closest allies rather than China.
  Are we deterred? We are self-deterred. Hesitation and hand-wringing 
over fears of escalation have become hallmarks of the Biden 
administration's foreign policy. Right now, you would be forgiven for 
wondering whether President Biden might take longer to respond to the 
Iran-backed strike that killed U.S. soldiers in Jordan than he did to 
finally approve long-range fires for Ukraine.
  The administration's public obsession with avoiding escalation at all 
cost only signals to our adversaries that, indeed, authoritarians can 
take what they want by force.
  Fortunately, Putin's aggression has clarified our allies' thinking. 
The West is waking up, turbocharging investments in new capabilities, 
and accelerating the expansion of our own defense industrial base.
  Beijing and Moscow are not happy to see war in Ukraine prompt two 
more highly advanced European nations make historic new commitments to 
collective defense of the West by joining NATO. They are not happy to 
see America's allies direct a gusher of historic military investments 
into cutting-edge American weapons made by American workers. In the 
past 2 years, Pacific allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia 
have been buying American to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. 
NATO allies have invested $120 billion of their own in U.S. 
capabilities. Importantly, they are also investing in expanding their 
own defense industrial capacities.
  Our allies recognize that Russia, China, and Iran are, as Secretary 
General Stoltenberg put it just yesterday here in Washington, ``shaping 
[an] alternative world where U.S. power is diminished [and] NATO is 
divided.'' In response, they are rejecting division and committing to 
interoperability and collective defense. In many ways, NATO is now more 
united than during the Cold War. But this progress is not a given. It 
depends on American leadership, and it is quite capable of unraveling. 
President Xi would like nothing more.
  There is really no quicker way to make sure we will be distracted 
from necessary competition with China than by letting Russian 
aggression in Europe fester. There is no surer path to dividing America 
from our closest allies than by shredding our credibility and 
abandoning Ukraine. The PRC hopes that America and our allies will lose 
our will to stand up to Russian aggression. President Xi hopes for 
Russian victory but will benefit, too, from a frozen conflict. As they 
watch Russia fight in Ukraine, what Beijing and Tehran fear is a 
Western victory.
  We must understand that the threats our adversaries pose are 
connected. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are making alarming new 
commitments to support and underwrite one another's aggressive 
behavior. Our Asian allies know it. They know that leaving Russia 
undefeated means leaving the PRC undeterred. And their security 
assistance to Ukraine demonstrates how seriously they take these linked 
threats.
  There is also growing transatlantic agreement that China is a 
systemic rival and a revisionist power.
  When the most successful military alliance in history stands 
together, it represents fully half of the world's military power and 
half of its economic power. NATO is a formidable force that inspires 
confidence and collaboration among an even wider circle of allies and 
partners, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. But when America and our 
allies let aggression linger undefeated, this force is spread thin. 
Beijing wants nothing more than to face a West still consumed by self-
deterrence in a conflict halfway around the world.

  Europe has woken up. It is outpacing America in direct assistance to

[[Page S327]]

Ukraine, with another =50 billion in assistance announced just today. 
This is good news. But even as our European allies ramp up their 
support, strengthen their defenses, upgrade their capabilities, and 
expand their defense industrial capacity, America doesn't get to opt 
out--opt out--of doing the same. Even as our most technologically 
advanced allies take historic steps forward, America doesn't have the 
luxury of pawning off our interests.
  Deterring China means defeating Russian aggression. Degrading 
Russia's military means weakening Beijing's ``friendship without 
limits'' with Moscow. Equipping Ukraine to defend itself means 
confronting the PRC with the thing it hates the most: sovereign nations 
that choose their leaders and defend their interests.
  Strengthening America's national security means standing with our 
allies and investing even more heavily in the capabilities we need to 
face our top strategic rival and every threat we face with formidable 
American strength.

                                 Energy

  Mr. President, on another matter, last week, the Biden administration 
followed through on a devastating threat to some of the most abundant 
and reliable energy made here in America and to those who rely on it 
around the world.
  The administration's de facto ban on new liquefied natural gas export 
permits is the sort of policy so profoundly damaging that it could only 
have been dreamt up by the leftwing activists who are increasingly 
calling the shots on President Biden's energy policies.
  As I have mentioned before, this de facto ban is harmful to American 
interests both at home and abroad. Canceled export permits mean 
canceled projects and canceled jobs. Bans on exploring and exporting 
American energy mean working families pay higher prices for gasoline, 
home heating, and countless other everyday expenses.
  Since President Biden took office, the cost of gasoline has increased 
a cumulative 35 percent, fuel oil prices have increased 61 percent, 
natural gas has increased 27 percent, and electricity prices have 
increased 25 percent. But the costs of the administration's green bent 
aren't confined to our own borders. For the past 2 years, allies who 
once relied on Russian energy have started consuming more clean 
American LNG. As a recent editorial put it, ``If new U.S. LNG projects 
are blocked, Europe and Asia will have to import gas from elsewhere to 
meet their growing demand. Most won't come from America's friends.''
  Iran and Russia are both increasing their LNG production 
capabilities, ready to meet desperate demand when American export 
capacity no longer can. Meanwhile, the same radical activists who drove 
a stake through the Keystone XL Pipeline are gleefully declaring 
victory in their campaign to make America and our allies more reliant 
on dirty energy from our adversaries.
  President Biden, in keeping with his administration's practice of 
rewarding bad behavior with more responsibility, put one of the 
masterminds of his climate policy up for a promotion at the EPA. 
Yesterday, Senate Democrats overran bipartisan opposition to confirm 
Joseph Goffman's nomination as Assistant Administrator.
  As I have said before, Mr. Goffman has encouraged the EPA's worst--
worst--regulatory excesses and put activist whims over American workers 
and job creators. By some estimates, he has presided over the 
elimination of half the Nation's coal jobs. Unfortunately, the radical 
climate agenda he is helping to steer shows no signs of slowing down.

                 Human Rights Defenders Protection Act

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to express my 
deep appreciation and gratitude for human rights defenders. They are 
the core of free, democratic societies. They risk their lives and 
freedom to hold governments and the private sector accountable. They 
advocate for human rights and political freedom. They protect our 
environment and fight corruption.
  Despite very real threats to their lives and safety, they have 
achieved incredible victories. Because of their tireless efforts, from 
Colombia to Mexico, nations across Latin America expanded reproductive 
rights; Argentina passed a law to prevent gender-based violence online 
and hold perpetrators accountable; the EU reached an agreement to 
require companies to address the human rights and environmental harms 
of their operations; and Malaysia and Ghana took steps to abolish the 
death penalty. We celebrate these victories.
  But I also must underline a deep sense of urgency today. Attacks 
against human rights defenders are on the rise across the globe. 
Hundreds are killed each year, and thousands more are attacked, 
threatened, or imprisoned: the Russian investigative journalist who was 
brutally attacked for exposing human rights abuses in the Northern 
Caucuses; the Guatemalan judge forced into exile after holding human 
rights abusers accountable for their actions during the brutal civil 
war; the taxi driver and human rights defender in Turkmenistan serving 
a 22-year sentence in a penal colony for documenting the torture of 
ethnic minorities; the 28-year-old human rights defender in Sudan who 
was killed, along with his parents and his four brothers; or one of the 
hundreds of human rights defenders killed by armed groups vying for 
control of Colombia's drug trafficking routes.
  Not only are attacks growing in scale, today's oppressors use 
sophisticated surveillance technology to target their enemies, even 
those living in exile.
  The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders has 
said:

       Governments claim that all this repression is about 
     national security. In reality it is about power and money. 
     They want to maintain power so they control information.

  As a result, those who stand for freedom and justice often face death 
threats, harassment, arbitrary detention, and torture.
  Women human rights defenders and those working on environmental 
protection, climate change, LBGTQI+ community issues, and indigenous 
rights face especially high levels of violence.
  I am pleased that the Biden administration has made protecting human 
rights defenders a priority for American foreign policy. Human rights 
defenders are heroes in the fight for democracy and freedom, and the 
United States must stand in solidarity with them.
  But we all need to do more. That is why I introduced the Human Rights 
Defenders Protection Act. This bill enhances our government's ability 
to prevent and respond to attacks on human rights defenders. It 
requires the administration to come up with a whole-of-government 
global strategy for human rights defenders. It creates a new, limited 
visa category for at-risk human rights defenders. It elevates the State 
Department's human rights officers in countries facing democracy and 
human rights crises. It trains Foreign Service officers on the 
protection of human rights defenders. It expands fellowships to allow 
human rights defenders to conduct research, outreach, and exchanges in 
the United States.
  My grandparents came to America in 1902 from Lithuania, where there 
were pogroms against Jews across Russia and Eastern Europe. The defense 
of human rights has always been profoundly important to me and my 
family.
  For many decades in my life, the Soviet Union was one of the greatest 
threats to human rights on Earth, and it seemed indestructible. But I 
remember standing with my wife at the Berlin Wall in 1987--a symbol of 
totalitarianism suffering. My wife and I hammered at the concrete that 
was covered in graffiti, showing a crossed-out hammer and sickle. 
Chipping away at the Berlin Wall was a reminder of the good we can 
achieve if only we have faith.
  So to everyone who cares about justice, to everyone who fights for 
freedom, to everyone who defends human rights against all odds, don't 
give up. Let us continue to advocate for those human rights defenders 
behind bars. Let us champion their efforts across the globe. Let us 
have faith that we can overcome oppression and violence and 
assassinations. Let us keep hope alive that we can build a world that 
is safe and peaceful and prosperous.
  With that, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I filed.

                       Nomination of Lisa W. Wang

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Lisa Wang to the U.S. Court of International Trade.
  Ms. Wang attended Cornell University and the Georgetown University 
Law Center before entering private practice in Washington, DC, as an 
international trade associate. Ms. Wang then spent 3 years serving in 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing as a senior import administration officer 
before joining the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as assistant 
general counsel. She went on to serve as a senior attorney in the 
Commerce Department's Office of the Chief Counsel for Trade Enforcement 
and Compliance before completing another stint in private practice.
  In 2021, President Biden nominated Ms. Wang to serve as an Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce for Enforcement and Compliance, and she was 
confirmed in the Senate by voice vote. At the Department of Commerce, 
she has led the Federal Government's efforts to maintain a level 
playing field for American workers and consumers by holding our 
partners accountable to their trade agreements.
  Ms. Wang was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar 
Association. Her deep knowledge of international trade law and 
commitment to fairness make her an excellent addition to the Court of 
International Trade. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for her 
confirmation.
  Mr. CARDIN. I yield the floor.

                           U.S. Supreme Court

  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about 
something every American wants from their public officials: 
transparency and accountability.
  Unfortunately, after repeated attempts, Congress has not received 
that transparency or accountability from Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas, and it is feeding the perception of corruption. For the past 6 
months, the Senate Finance Committee has been trying to get straight 
answers from the Justice and his wealthy friends about the growing list 
of handouts they have lavished on the Justice.
  Most recently, we sought to figure out whether Justice Thomas 
secretly had over $250,000 in debt written off--simply wiped away--by a 
wealthy benefactor. If so, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, 
I am working to learn whether he paid the taxes he was supposed to--
taxes that any American is legally required to pay.
  The Justice has refused to respond. Justice Thomas acts as if the 
freebies and the special favors Americans are reading about--the 
flights on private jets, comped; trips on luxury yachts; megawealthy 
individuals paying for school tuitions; quarter-million-dollar debts 
wiped away--is totally normal stuff.
  The reality is, it is not. It isn't normal for anyone, and when the 
person receiving all of these extravagant handouts is one of the nine 
most powerful jurists in the country, with unchecked power to rewrite 
laws from the bench, it looks worse.
  With respect to this disappearing debt, here is what we know. In 
1999, one of Justice Thomas's friends loaned him $267,230 to buy a 
luxury RV. That is some kind of friend.
  Justice Thomas wants to believe the story is simple, like the couple 
hundred bucks you would loan somebody to get their car fixed in an 
emergency. This is the story that the Justice has, in effect, 
apparently subscribed to obscures the truth.
  The simple fact here is that loans have to be repaid, and it sure 
looks like this one was not. According to the terms of the loan 
agreement--which, by the way, was written down on Supreme Court 
stationary from the chamber of Clarence Thomas--Thomas's friend 
supplied the money to buy Thomas the luxury RV. In return, the Justice 
was supposed to pay 7.5 percent interest for 5 years. Then the loan 
would come due, and then Justice Thomas would be responsible for having 
to repay the full principal. But from what I have seen, the payment 
never happened.
  Through my investigation, I have uncovered that Justice Thomas only 
paid interest on the transaction. When the deadline hit after 5 years, 
his friend extended the maturity date on the loan for another decade. 
But just 4 years later, Thomas' friend simply decided to stop 
collecting payments from the Justice, even though the Justice still 
owed him more than $\1/4\ million.
  Justice Thomas's friend wrote a note telling him that the interest he 
paid was good enough and that he wouldn't accept further payments. That 
means that the debt--likely the entire $260,000 in principal--was 
considered forgiven. Again, that is quite a friend.
  So the documents we have seen indicate Justice Thomas received a 
$267,000 loan to buy a luxury RV and never repaid most--and, likely, 
not even a dollar--of the money that his friend originally loaned him. 
This has legal consequences.
  The Tax Code makes clear that in instances where a debt is canceled, 
forgiven, or discharged for less than the amount owed, the borrower 
must report the amount canceled or forgiven as income for tax purposes. 
Furthermore, the forgiven debt is income that Justice Thomas is 
required by law to report on his financial disclosure report.
  But Justice Thomas never reported the $\1/4\ million in forgiven debt 
on his financial disclosure report in 2008, the year his debt was 
forgiven. He won't give the Finance Committee a direct answer on 
whether he reported it on his taxes, raising serious legal questions.
  After I publicly revealed these findings, Justice Thomas, through his 
lawyer, said the documents that I reviewed were untrue. The Justice 
said:

       The loan was never forgiven. Any suggestion to the contrary 
     is false.

  And--

       The terms of the agreement were satisfied in full.

  This contradicts the documents I reviewed. So, along with Senator 
Whitehouse, our colleague from Rhode Island, we wrote to Justice 
Thomas's lawyer and gave him a chance to prove his claim. Personally, I 
believe that a sitting Supreme Court Justice would jump at the 
opportunity to correct the record and prove that he repaid his debt and 
did not cheat on taxes. I wish I could report to the American people 
that was the case and that this whole mess was just a misunderstanding. 
But that did not happen.
  Justice Thomas did not give us any documentation about his so-called 
loan. Senator Whitehouse and I gave him a month to respond and received 
nothing--no loan agreement, no payment schedule, no evidence of 
principal payments, and no explanation for why he and his lawyer said 
the documents and information I uncovered were untrue. If what Justice 
Thomas and his lawyer are saying about the loan is accurate, the 
question is, What is behind all the stonewalling?
  Does the Justice believe he shouldn't ever have to answer the 
questions about all these major windfalls and luxury travel, not even 
to prove that everything was on the level? Justice Thomas and his 
lawyers could put this whole affair to rest by providing copies of 
checks repaying the $\1/4\ million loan.
  My personal guess is they can't because those payments never 
happened.
  If a wealthy friend forgave a $\1/4\ million loan to Justice Thomas, 
the law requires that he declare it.
  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, it is essential that 
Justice Thomas list that income on his taxes. He is also required to 
disclose the money on his financial disclosure report. Based on what we 
have seen, it

[[Page S330]]

seems like he did neither. Our laws, including our tax laws, have to 
apply to everyone. The law applies to everyone, especially one of the 
nine most powerful jurists in America. Congress must ensure that they 
do.
  It is time for Justice Thomas to respond with the facts about this 
$\1/4\ million loan and any similar money and gifts he has received as 
a Supreme Court Justice.
  Now, Madam President, I am going to yield to my colleague on the 
Finance Committee. He is also the chairman of the Budget Committee and 
chairman of the important Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, our 
colleague Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me start by thanking our Finance 
Committee chairman, Chairman Wyden, for his strong leadership. Chairman 
Wyden was able to secure the cooperation of the wealthy donor who gave 
Justice Thomas the $\1/4\ million-plus RV loan. The chairman doggedly 
followed the facts to get the truth for the American people, which 
takes guts, particularly when you consider the many special interests 
rooting for this investigation to go away.
  And while I am thanking the chairman, let me also thank Chairman 
Durbin for his persistent and dogged pursuit of the truth through the 
Judiciary Committee. Both the Judiciary and Finance Committees are 
working to get to the bottom of this.
  Keep in mind, in all the ethics mess engulfing Justice Thomas, that 
for every ethics issue, there is also likely a tax issue; perhaps, two 
sides of the same coin. If a Justice isn't reporting income on his 
legally required financial disclosure, there is a good chance that 
something is amiss with his tax reporting as well.
  When a Justice receives something of value from a benefactor, the 
presumption is that it needs to be disclosed under the ethics law 
either as income or as a gift. Generally speaking, if it is income, the 
Justice must also report it as income for income tax purposes; and if 
it is a gift, the donor needs to report it for gift tax purposes--which 
is why when you are looking at possible ethics violations in situations 
like this, it is important to know if that income showed up on the tax 
side or if that gift report showed up on the tax side. That is why 
Chairman Wyden's leadership here is so essential.
  If this went unreported, that could be a tax law violation. Again, if 
it is a gift, the Justice needs to disclose it under the ethics law 
unless it falls under a narrow definition for ``personal 
hospitality''--spending Christmas with your in-laws, for instance, or 
going on a trip with your college roommates. So either way, the tax 
question becomes for donors, for gifts, did the benefactor or did the 
donor report it for gift tax purposes? So you have the income tax 
reporting issue, the gift tax reporting issue. And then you have a 
third issue, which is that these tax filings can also test the veracity 
of what Justices claim.
  Justices Thomas and Alito claim they didn't have to report free jet 
and yacht travel gifted by billionaires because those gifts, they 
claimed, were personal hospitality. There were no college roommates or 
in-laws involved. It is a heck of a stretch to call this personal 
hospitality. But one of the ways you could test whether it is personal 
hospitality would be by looking at how the donor of the hospitality 
treated it on their taxes. It would be a pretty good tell that all that 
hospitality those Justices received was not so personal if the yacht 
and jet travel gifted to Justices Thomas and Alito was written off by 
these billionaires as a tax expense--as a business expense. So there is 
a lot to be learned from tax filing.
  Two other reminders as we go through this. One, it is a crime. It is 
a crime under 18 U.S. Code section 1001 to file a false sworn statement 
with the Federal Government. Both judicial disclosures and tax filings 
are filed under oath.
  No. 2, the law requires the Judicial Conference, if there is any 
question about whether an improper judicial disclosure filing might 
have been willful, to refer the question of willfulness to the Attorney 
General for investigation. It is not under the law of the Judicial 
Conference's job to decide the question of willfulness; it is only to 
decide if there is a question of willfulness and then refer that to the 
Attorney General for investigation.
  So this can get serious fast, which brings us to Justice Thomas and 
his RV. When it comes to ethics requirements, there is no question 
about what the law required here. If part of Justice Thomas's debt was 
forgiven, he had to report it. The state of the facts based on the 
documents the Finance Committee has obtained and reviewed is that 
Justice Thomas never paid back a dollar of principal on $\1/4\ million 
loan and that the donor long ago stopped collecting even interest on 
that loan.
  So let's take a look at the law. Justice Thomas likely didn't have to 
report the loan itself. Justices don't need to report loans secured by 
a personal vehicle as long as the value of the loan isn't worth more 
than the vehicle itself.
  If Justice Thomas put up the RV as collateral for his loan and didn't 
obtain more money than the RV was worth, there was no need for him to 
disclose the loan. But all that changes if any part of the loan was 
forgiven later on. As the chairman has said, when you collect not $1 of 
principal and stop collecting interest, that sure looks like 
forgiveness of a loan. And a loan you don't pay back is a form of 
income.
  The law requires officials to disclose any income they receive 
outside of their government salaries, which makes sense if you are 
trying to expose or prevent corruption. Under the law, if you receive 
more than $200 of income from any one person in a year, you have to 
disclose that.
  Here are the regulations on financial disclosure. These are regs 
adopted pursuant to law, and they say that income ``includes but is not 
limited to'' income from ``discharge of indebtedness.'' And down here, 
it further says that you must report ``discharge of indebtedness.''
  And if you go to the Tax Code--specifically 26 U.S. Code, section 21, 
which defines income for tax purposes, subsection 11(a) describes that 
``income from discharge of indebtedness counts as income.'' Income from 
discharge of indebtedness--it is the identical language in the Tax Code 
and in the judicial reporting regulations.
  So a loan whose principal is not repaid is reportable income both 
under judicial ethics law and under tax law. And the law is crystal 
clear on this point.
  Even Justices are told what the law is on this point. So if you go to 
the ``Filing Instructions for Judicial Officers''--this is what the 
judge gets that tells them how to comply with their filing requirements 
regarding these disclosures. Here is what it tells them:

       Income . . . The disclosure of the gross amount and the 
     type of income--dividends, rent, interest, or income from 
     discharge of indebtedness--is required.

  Disclosure of income from discharge of indebtedness is required.
  There is nothing very subtle or complicated about that. It couldn't 
be more straightforward.
  If Justice Thomas failed to report a loan that was no longer being 
collected with a big balance still due and hence was, as a practical 
matter, forgiven, he likely violated these requirements.
  If he failed to file his taxes accordingly, he also likely violated 
our tax laws. Either of these--either the tax filing or the filing 
under the judicial disclosure rules--could amount to a false statement 
under the Criminal Code.

  In the first instance, as to the judicial disclosure filings, the law 
requires the Judicial Conference to determine if there is reason to 
believe that Justice Thomas's violation may have been willful, in which 
case it has a legal obligation to report him to the Attorney General 
for further investigation to settle the question of willfulness.
  I have asked the Judicial Conference to consider exactly these facts, 
and I hope they will do so. It looks like they are. As they do so, here 
are some things they should consider:
  First, this is not Justice Thomas's first brush with this law. A 
previous episode of yacht and jet travel gifts to him from Harlan Crow 
actually went to the Judicial Conference for investigation years ago.
  In my subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, we held a hearing 
about this with a judge who served on the Judicial Conference at the 
time and could relate to us what transpired

[[Page S331]]

back then with the Crow to Thomas yacht and jet travel undisclosed 
gifts.
  That episode I would describe as a decent burial, but it is not clear 
now that, with Thomas back as a repeat offender with the same types of 
gifts from the same billionaire, that he will get the same courtesies 
from his fellow judges as he did in episode one of Crow to Thomas yacht 
and jet travel gifts. Indeed, the latest report from the Judicial 
Conference--they put out two reports a year. This is their report of 
proceedings for this past fall; i.e., this is their most recent report 
of proceedings, dated September 12 of last year. It has this rather 
Delphic sentence in it:

       The Committee was also updated on the status of the ongoing 
     review of public written allegations of errors or omissions 
     in a filer's financial disclosure reports that were referred 
     to it since the Conference's last session.

  I don't know of any other judge or Justice who has received public 
written allegations of errors or omissions in that filer's financial 
disclosure reports other than Justice Thomas. So although there is no 
name mentioned here, it looks very much like the Thomas investigation 
is alive and well in the Judicial Conference. If they should determine 
that there is a question of willfulness in his failure to file, 
particularly to the extent that it may involve similar failures in tax 
filings, it is their legal obligation to present that question to the 
Attorney General.
  So it appears that the matter remains under active review, and I 
would conclude by saying that this is to be continued.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, conversations are ongoing. Some issues 
still need resolution, but we are getting very close on the national 
security supplemental.
  The national security supplemental is so important to enabling us to 
address multiple crises around the globe. Vladimir Putin has waged war 
against Ukraine and against Western democracy for nearly 2 years, and 
America must step up. Israel suffered its bloodiest day last fall at 
the hands of the terror group Hamas, and millions of innocent Gaza 
civilians are in need of aid. The Chinese Communist Party threatens to 
increase tensions in the Indo-Pacific. Our southern border is in urgent 
need--in urgent need--of fixing.
  Addressing these challenges is not easy, but we cannot simply shirk 
from our responsibilities just because a task is difficult.


                           Order of Business

  So, for the information of Senators, the Senate will be in session 
and will hold a vote on Monday, February 5. There is no longer a no-
vote day. While we are respectful of Members' schedules and try to 
limit inconveniences, these challenges at the border, in Ukraine, and 
in the Middle East are just too great, and we will need to be here 
working.
  Next, as I said, discussions are going well, so I want Members to be 
aware that we plan to post the full text of the national security 
supplemental as early as tomorrow, no later than Sunday. That will give 
Members plenty of time to read the bill before voting on it.
  As for the timing of the vote, I plan to file cloture on the motion 
to proceed to the vehicle on Monday, leading to the first vote on the 
national security supplemental no later than Wednesday.

                           U.S. Supreme Court

  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about 
something every American wants from their public officials: 
transparency and accountability.
  Unfortunately, after repeated attempts, Congress has not received 
that transparency or accountability from Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas, and it is feeding the perception of corruption. For the past 6 
months, the Senate Finance Committee has been trying to get straight 
answers from the Justice and his wealthy friends about the growing list 
of handouts they have lavished on the Justice.
  Most recently, we sought to figure out whether Justice Thomas 
secretly had over $250,000 in debt written off--simply wiped away--by a 
wealthy benefactor. If so, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, 
I am working to learn whether he paid the taxes he was supposed to--
taxes that any American is legally required to pay.
  The Justice has refused to respond. Justice Thomas acts as if the 
freebies and the special favors Americans are reading about--the 
flights on private jets, comped; trips on luxury yachts; megawealthy 
individuals paying for school tuitions; quarter-million-dollar debts 
wiped away--is totally normal stuff.
  The reality is, it is not. It isn't normal for anyone, and when the 
person receiving all of these extravagant handouts is one of the nine 
most powerful jurists in the country, with unchecked power to rewrite 
laws from the bench, it looks worse.
  With respect to this disappearing debt, here is what we know. In 
1999, one of Justice Thomas's friends loaned him $267,230 to buy a 
luxury RV. That is some kind of friend.
  Justice Thomas wants to believe the story is simple, like the couple 
hundred bucks you would loan somebody to get their car fixed in an 
emergency. This is the story that the Justice has, in effect, 
apparently subscribed to obscures the truth.
  The simple fact here is that loans have to be repaid, and it sure 
looks like this one was not. According to the terms of the loan 
agreement--which, by the way, was written down on Supreme Court 
stationary from the chamber of Clarence Thomas--Thomas's friend 
supplied the money to buy Thomas the luxury RV. In return, the Justice 
was supposed to pay 7.5 percent interest for 5 years. Then the loan 
would come due, and then Justice Thomas would be responsible for having 
to repay the full principal. But from what I have seen, the payment 
never happened.
  Through my investigation, I have uncovered that Justice Thomas only 
paid interest on the transaction. When the deadline hit after 5 years, 
his friend extended the maturity date on the loan for another decade. 
But just 4 years later, Thomas' friend simply decided to stop 
collecting payments from the Justice, even though the Justice still 
owed him more than $\1/4\ million.
  Justice Thomas's friend wrote a note telling him that the interest he 
paid was good enough and that he wouldn't accept further payments. That 
means that the debt--likely the entire $260,000 in principal--was 
considered forgiven. Again, that is quite a friend.
  So the documents we have seen indicate Justice Thomas received a 
$267,000 loan to buy a luxury RV and never repaid most--and, likely, 
not even a dollar--of the money that his friend originally loaned him. 
This has legal consequences.
  The Tax Code makes clear that in instances where a debt is canceled, 
forgiven, or discharged for less than the amount owed, the borrower 
must report the amount canceled or forgiven as income for tax purposes. 
Furthermore, the forgiven debt is income that Justice Thomas is 
required by law to report on his financial disclosure report.
  But Justice Thomas never reported the $\1/4\ million in forgiven debt 
on his financial disclosure report in 2008, the year his debt was 
forgiven. He won't give the Finance Committee a direct answer on 
whether he reported it on his taxes, raising serious legal questions.
  After I publicly revealed these findings, Justice Thomas, through his 
lawyer, said the documents that I reviewed were untrue. The Justice 
said:

       The loan was never forgiven. Any suggestion to the contrary 
     is false.

  And--

       The terms of the agreement were satisfied in full.

  This contradicts the documents I reviewed. So, along with Senator 
Whitehouse, our colleague from Rhode Island, we wrote to Justice 
Thomas's lawyer and gave him a chance to prove his claim. Personally, I 
believe that a sitting Supreme Court Justice would jump at the 
opportunity to correct the record and prove that he repaid his debt and 
did not cheat on taxes. I wish I could report to the American people 
that was the case and that this whole mess was just a misunderstanding. 
But that did not happen.
  Justice Thomas did not give us any documentation about his so-called 
loan. Senator Whitehouse and I gave him a month to respond and received 
nothing--no loan agreement, no payment schedule, no evidence of 
principal payments, and no explanation for why he and his lawyer said 
the documents and information I uncovered were untrue. If what Justice 
Thomas and his lawyer are saying about the loan is accurate, the 
question is, What is behind all the stonewalling?
  Does the Justice believe he shouldn't ever have to answer the 
questions about all these major windfalls and luxury travel, not even 
to prove that everything was on the level? Justice Thomas and his 
lawyers could put this whole affair to rest by providing copies of 
checks repaying the $\1/4\ million loan.
  My personal guess is they can't because those payments never 
happened.
  If a wealthy friend forgave a $\1/4\ million loan to Justice Thomas, 
the law requires that he declare it.
  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, it is essential that 
Justice Thomas list that income on his taxes. He is also required to 
disclose the money on his financial disclosure report. Based on what we 
have seen, it

[[Page S330]]

seems like he did neither. Our laws, including our tax laws, have to 
apply to everyone. The law applies to everyone, especially one of the 
nine most powerful jurists in America. Congress must ensure that they 
do.
  It is time for Justice Thomas to respond with the facts about this 
$\1/4\ million loan and any similar money and gifts he has received as 
a Supreme Court Justice.
  Now, Madam President, I am going to yield to my colleague on the 
Finance Committee. He is also the chairman of the Budget Committee and 
chairman of the important Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, our 
colleague Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me start by thanking our Finance 
Committee chairman, Chairman Wyden, for his strong leadership. Chairman 
Wyden was able to secure the cooperation of the wealthy donor who gave 
Justice Thomas the $\1/4\ million-plus RV loan. The chairman doggedly 
followed the facts to get the truth for the American people, which 
takes guts, particularly when you consider the many special interests 
rooting for this investigation to go away.
  And while I am thanking the chairman, let me also thank Chairman 
Durbin for his persistent and dogged pursuit of the truth through the 
Judiciary Committee. Both the Judiciary and Finance Committees are 
working to get to the bottom of this.
  Keep in mind, in all the ethics mess engulfing Justice Thomas, that 
for every ethics issue, there is also likely a tax issue; perhaps, two 
sides of the same coin. If a Justice isn't reporting income on his 
legally required financial disclosure, there is a good chance that 
something is amiss with his tax reporting as well.
  When a Justice receives something of value from a benefactor, the 
presumption is that it needs to be disclosed under the ethics law 
either as income or as a gift. Generally speaking, if it is income, the 
Justice must also report it as income for income tax purposes; and if 
it is a gift, the donor needs to report it for gift tax purposes--which 
is why when you are looking at possible ethics violations in situations 
like this, it is important to know if that income showed up on the tax 
side or if that gift report showed up on the tax side. That is why 
Chairman Wyden's leadership here is so essential.
  If this went unreported, that could be a tax law violation. Again, if 
it is a gift, the Justice needs to disclose it under the ethics law 
unless it falls under a narrow definition for ``personal 
hospitality''--spending Christmas with your in-laws, for instance, or 
going on a trip with your college roommates. So either way, the tax 
question becomes for donors, for gifts, did the benefactor or did the 
donor report it for gift tax purposes? So you have the income tax 
reporting issue, the gift tax reporting issue. And then you have a 
third issue, which is that these tax filings can also test the veracity 
of what Justices claim.
  Justices Thomas and Alito claim they didn't have to report free jet 
and yacht travel gifted by billionaires because those gifts, they 
claimed, were personal hospitality. There were no college roommates or 
in-laws involved. It is a heck of a stretch to call this personal 
hospitality. But one of the ways you could test whether it is personal 
hospitality would be by looking at how the donor of the hospitality 
treated it on their taxes. It would be a pretty good tell that all that 
hospitality those Justices received was not so personal if the yacht 
and jet travel gifted to Justices Thomas and Alito was written off by 
these billionaires as a tax expense--as a business expense. So there is 
a lot to be learned from tax filing.
  Two other reminders as we go through this. One, it is a crime. It is 
a crime under 18 U.S. Code section 1001 to file a false sworn statement 
with the Federal Government. Both judicial disclosures and tax filings 
are filed under oath.
  No. 2, the law requires the Judicial Conference, if there is any 
question about whether an improper judicial disclosure filing might 
have been willful, to refer the question of willfulness to the Attorney 
General for investigation. It is not under the law of the Judicial 
Conference's job to decide the question of willfulness; it is only to 
decide if there is a question of willfulness and then refer that to the 
Attorney General for investigation.
  So this can get serious fast, which brings us to Justice Thomas and 
his RV. When it comes to ethics requirements, there is no question 
about what the law required here. If part of Justice Thomas's debt was 
forgiven, he had to report it. The state of the facts based on the 
documents the Finance Committee has obtained and reviewed is that 
Justice Thomas never paid back a dollar of principal on $\1/4\ million 
loan and that the donor long ago stopped collecting even interest on 
that loan.
  So let's take a look at the law. Justice Thomas likely didn't have to 
report the loan itself. Justices don't need to report loans secured by 
a personal vehicle as long as the value of the loan isn't worth more 
than the vehicle itself.
  If Justice Thomas put up the RV as collateral for his loan and didn't 
obtain more money than the RV was worth, there was no need for him to 
disclose the loan. But all that changes if any part of the loan was 
forgiven later on. As the chairman has said, when you collect not $1 of 
principal and stop collecting interest, that sure looks like 
forgiveness of a loan. And a loan you don't pay back is a form of 
income.
  The law requires officials to disclose any income they receive 
outside of their government salaries, which makes sense if you are 
trying to expose or prevent corruption. Under the law, if you receive 
more than $200 of income from any one person in a year, you have to 
disclose that.
  Here are the regulations on financial disclosure. These are regs 
adopted pursuant to law, and they say that income ``includes but is not 
limited to'' income from ``discharge of indebtedness.'' And down here, 
it further says that you must report ``discharge of indebtedness.''
  And if you go to the Tax Code--specifically 26 U.S. Code, section 21, 
which defines income for tax purposes, subsection 11(a) describes that 
``income from discharge of indebtedness counts as income.'' Income from 
discharge of indebtedness--it is the identical language in the Tax Code 
and in the judicial reporting regulations.
  So a loan whose principal is not repaid is reportable income both 
under judicial ethics law and under tax law. And the law is crystal 
clear on this point.
  Even Justices are told what the law is on this point. So if you go to 
the ``Filing Instructions for Judicial Officers''--this is what the 
judge gets that tells them how to comply with their filing requirements 
regarding these disclosures. Here is what it tells them:

       Income . . . The disclosure of the gross amount and the 
     type of income--dividends, rent, interest, or income from 
     discharge of indebtedness--is required.

  Disclosure of income from discharge of indebtedness is required.
  There is nothing very subtle or complicated about that. It couldn't 
be more straightforward.
  If Justice Thomas failed to report a loan that was no longer being 
collected with a big balance still due and hence was, as a practical 
matter, forgiven, he likely violated these requirements.
  If he failed to file his taxes accordingly, he also likely violated 
our tax laws. Either of these--either the tax filing or the filing 
under the judicial disclosure rules--could amount to a false statement 
under the Criminal Code.

  In the first instance, as to the judicial disclosure filings, the law 
requires the Judicial Conference to determine if there is reason to 
believe that Justice Thomas's violation may have been willful, in which 
case it has a legal obligation to report him to the Attorney General 
for further investigation to settle the question of willfulness.
  I have asked the Judicial Conference to consider exactly these facts, 
and I hope they will do so. It looks like they are. As they do so, here 
are some things they should consider:
  First, this is not Justice Thomas's first brush with this law. A 
previous episode of yacht and jet travel gifts to him from Harlan Crow 
actually went to the Judicial Conference for investigation years ago.
  In my subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, we held a hearing 
about this with a judge who served on the Judicial Conference at the 
time and could relate to us what transpired

[[Page S331]]

back then with the Crow to Thomas yacht and jet travel undisclosed 
gifts.
  That episode I would describe as a decent burial, but it is not clear 
now that, with Thomas back as a repeat offender with the same types of 
gifts from the same billionaire, that he will get the same courtesies 
from his fellow judges as he did in episode one of Crow to Thomas yacht 
and jet travel gifts. Indeed, the latest report from the Judicial 
Conference--they put out two reports a year. This is their report of 
proceedings for this past fall; i.e., this is their most recent report 
of proceedings, dated September 12 of last year. It has this rather 
Delphic sentence in it:

       The Committee was also updated on the status of the ongoing 
     review of public written allegations of errors or omissions 
     in a filer's financial disclosure reports that were referred 
     to it since the Conference's last session.

  I don't know of any other judge or Justice who has received public 
written allegations of errors or omissions in that filer's financial 
disclosure reports other than Justice Thomas. So although there is no 
name mentioned here, it looks very much like the Thomas investigation 
is alive and well in the Judicial Conference. If they should determine 
that there is a question of willfulness in his failure to file, 
particularly to the extent that it may involve similar failures in tax 
filings, it is their legal obligation to present that question to the 
Attorney General.
  So it appears that the matter remains under active review, and I 
would conclude by saying that this is to be continued.
  I yield the floor.

                                  Iran

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tensions in the Middle East have escalated 
dramatically since Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization, 
launched its war on Israel on October 7 of last year, killing innocent 
men, women, and children and taking and still holding up to 132 
hostages.
  Over the last few months, another Iranian proxy--Iran-backed 
militias--intensified their attacks throughout the region.
  There are Houthis in Yemen, there is Hezbollah in Lebanon, and, of 
course, as I mentioned, there are the attacks against Americans and 
American interests by Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria. These 
conflicts are playing out thousands of miles away from here, but we are 
not just a distant and disinterested spectator. Thousands of American 
troops are stationed in the region--not engaged in combat operations 
but in carrying out a range of security and intelligence missions and 
helping the residents and citizens of those nations defend themselves 
and

[[Page S332]]

provide a stabilizing force against what is the No. 1 state sponsor of 
terrorism, which is the Iranian regime.
  The presence of these American troops is vital to the stability of 
the region and, as I said, our own security interests. We may engage in 
wishful thinking, thinking that what happens over there doesn't affect 
us here. You would think that after 9/11--albeit it occurring some 23 
years ago now--it would have awakened us to the reality that what does 
happen in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle East. So it is 
important for us to provide stability operations and assistance, train-
and-assist operations, for our allies in the region in a very dangerous 
neighborhood.
  Since mid-October, Iranian-backed militia groups have attacked U.S. 
troops in the region more than 165 times--165 times. In less than 4 
months, U.S. troops have been targeted 165 times.
  This last weekend, the situation escalated dramatically when Iranian 
proxies targeted a U.S. military post in Jordan known as Tower 22. 
Tragically, these proxies of the Iranian regime--these militias--used a 
drone to attack the base, killing three American heroes as they slept.
  SGT William Rivers, SGT Kennedy Sanders, and SGT Breonna Moffett made 
the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country that night.
  These brave individuals were the first American servicemembers killed 
by enemy fire since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last October, but 
they are not the first Americans who have been targeted by the Iranian 
regime.
  The truth is, as you look back at the changes in Iran since the 
revolution in 1979, the Iranian regime has been in what you might call 
a low-grade war against America and American interests for the last 45 
years.
  Last month, two Navy SEALs were killed while seizing a vessel 
carrying Iranian-made arms intended for the Houthi rebels in Yemen. 
These brave SEALs and their comrades prevented the Houthis from 
receiving ballistic missiles and cruise missile components that could 
have been used to target U.S. forces or commercial traffic in the Red 
Sea or the nation of Israel.
  Today, I know our country mourns alongside of the families of each of 
those heroes, and we pray for the safety of the servicemembers who 
continue to serve our Nation providing these stability missions in the 
Middle East.
  But, as I said, the violence that we are seeing and experiencing in 
recent days is only a tragic continuation of Iran's decades-long proxy 
war against the United States. I said Iran is the No. 1 state sponsor 
of terrorism in the world. That is a fact. And the reason they operate 
through proxies is because they don't want to directly confront the 
United States because they fear American military might, as they 
should. But what they do is they will carry out terrorist attacks, 
having been equipped and trained and provided weapons by the Iranian 
regime, against innocent civilians and American servicemembers in the 
region.
  Of course, relations between the United States and Iran have been 
extremely fraught and violent since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when 
the country quickly transformed from a pro-Western democracy to an 
anti-Western theocracy. Its Supreme Leader is driven by a radical 
ideology and a deep hatred of the United States and the freedoms that 
we enjoy. He even referred to the United States as the ``Great Satan.''
  As we have witnessed over the last four-plus decades, that shift from 
a pro-democracy to an anti-American policy carried with it very serious 
consequences. Of course, many of us remember the Iranian hostage 
crisis. The movie ``Argo'' was written about getting some of the 52 
Americans out of Iran who had been held hostage for up to a year.
  Four years later, the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah in 
Lebanon bombed a Marine Corps barracks, killing 241 American 
servicemembers.
  And then, in 1996, Iran orchestrated an attack on U.S. Air Force 
personnel in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. A truck bomb was detonated next to a 
building housing American troops, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel 
and a local Saudi citizen and wounding 498 others.
  Then, during the war in Iraq, from 2003 to 2011, it became common 
knowledge that Iran was supplying the most dangerous form of 
munitions--explosively formed penetrators--that penetrate the armor of 
humvees and other up-armored vehicles that the U.S. forces were in and 
planted numerous IEDs, killing hundreds of American troops.
  And today, as our country is mourning the troops who were killed in 
Jordan last weekend at the hand of Iranian proxies, we need to be 
absolutely clear-eyed about the fact that this is not a new innovation. 
This isn't something that just happened in the last 2 days. This has 
been going on for 45 years.
  To be clear, this is not an exhaustive list of the violence Iran has 
unleashed against the United States and our interests. Sadly, this just 
scratches the surface. But it is important to look back at the history 
to understand the Iranian intentions toward the United States and our 
allies.
  Tehran has consistently waged acts of war against the United States. 
It has gone to great lengths to export terrorism around the globe, and 
it has engaged in gross human rights violations against its own people.
  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, otherwise known as IRGC, is 
the loyal henchman responsible for leading these efforts. It is a 
branch of the Iranian Armed Forces that tries to squash democracy 
movements, both at home and abroad, by pushing its extreme ideology 
beyond Iran's borders. They provide training and equipment to 
terrorists which they use to kill innocent civilians--not just in 
Israel, not just in Syria and Iraq, not just in Lebanon, but even in 
the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen.
  The IRGC wields vast power and influence, and it uses its 
capabilities to spark turmoil throughout the Middle East. As I said, it 
provides arms, training, and foot soldiers to these terrorist groups.
  As the world has seen in recent months, those attacks are quickly 
intensifying. It is a grave cause for concern in a very dangerous 
neighborhood, the sort of escalation that we are seeing by Iran via its 
proxies. But the only responsible answer is for the United States to 
take swift and decisive action to respond to these attacks, because, if 
we don't, we are sure to be met with more.
  Sadly, I don't think the Biden administration has responded to this 
attack with the sort of decisiveness that it needs. As far as we know, 
the administration hasn't taken any action to target Iran's leaders, 
the IRGC, or the Quds Force--militarily, financially, or otherwise.
  We are told that the President has decided what he is going to do, 
but he is not sharing that with us. And, I fear, as more and more time 
goes by, the Iranian regime will not connect the killing of three 
American servicemembers in Iraq by Shia militias backed by Iran with 
whatever the subsequent kinetic attack against Iran's forces are.
  We are all watching to see what the coming days may hold, but I would 
like to encourage President Biden that, when it comes to Iran, there is 
no benefit to applying anything less than maximum pressure.
  Now, we are not talking about American boots on the ground. We are 
not talking about another war. We are talking about deterrence.
  So if there is no price to be paid for these repeated attacks against 
civilians and American servicemembers, they are going to continue. This 
is not a cost-benefit analysis made by the regime; this is pursuant to 
their radical ideology where they want to destroy Israel. And they call 
America the ``Great Satan''; so you know they don't mean us well.
  Iran's leaders must learn that the attacks on U.S. servicemembers and 
American interests will be returned in kind. Regardless of who carries 
out an attack--Iran or its proxies--the Iranian regime must be brought 
to account. It is the head of the octopus, and the tentacles are the 
proxies they use to commit mayhem and terrorism around the region. The 
only way to achieve deterrence and to prevent this conflict from 
widening is to teach the Iranian regime that these sorts of unilateral 
terrorist attacks will not be tolerated.

  Given the escalating tensions between our countries, President Biden 
can't continue promoting the same

[[Page S333]]

weak policies that he has embraced over the last few years, trying to 
appease the Iranian regime because he wants to get them back in the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran nuclear deal, 
negotiated under President Obama.
  He has lifted sanctions, which have allowed Iran to supply China and 
other countries oil, which has helped bolster their economy. They have 
continued to enrich uranium, getting closer and closer to a breakout 
for a nuclear weapon. As dangerous as Iran and its proxies are now, can 
you imagine what it would be like if they had a functioning nuclear 
weapon in the region?
  What would the response be of countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and 
other Arab countries that Iran has historically fought for control--not 
just geographic control but control as the leader of the Muslim world, 
according to their own brand of Islam.
  Unfortunately, in the messages that President Biden has sent over the 
last few years, from the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan without 
even notifying our allies--just pulling the plug and having the Taliban 
march in without a shot being fired--to the attempts to appease Iran in 
order to get back to the Iran nuclear deal, to the foolish decision to 
unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets, the Biden administration has 
projected an image of weakness when it comes to foreign policy.
  These missteps have sent a message to the Supreme Leader that he can 
continue to push until we push back. The Supreme Leader will naturally 
continue to test the limits of this administration to see how far he 
can go. We know what his ultimate aims are. We know the methods by 
which they act, and we don't need--we don't want--any more dead 
Americans because Iran continues to attack Americans and American 
allies in the Middle East.
  The root and foundation of all of this violence and instability in 
the Middle East is Iran. We can talk about Hezbollah, Hamas, the 
Houthis, and the Shia militias, but it is Iran that finances, equips, 
and trains these terrorists. That is true today, and it has been true 
literally for the last 45 years. From the Iran hostage crisis to the 
regime's outright support of terrorist groups in the Middle East, to 
the latest attack that killed three U.S. troops, Iran has demonstrated 
over and over and over again its unequivocal hatred of the United 
States.
  President Biden cannot hit Iran with kid gloves or allow the attacks 
on our servicemembers to go unanswered. It is a lesson that we have to 
learn, apparently, from history, time and time again, that appeasement 
is not a viable strategy when it comes to autocrats and dictators and 
terrorists. Appeasement doesn't work, and it is time for the President 
to impose crippling consequences on the Iranian regime, and I am 
talking about on the instruments of their terrorism, which is the IRGC 
and the Quds Force, which would be a good place to start.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

tempore of the U.S. Senate.


                               Summer EBT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been fighting for over a decade to 
establish a new summer nutrition program to help end child hunger, and 
I come to the floor today to celebrate the tremendous progress we have 
made in that effort because, this year, legislation I fought to pass in 
2022 based on my Stop Child Hunger Act will go into effect, 
establishing a permanent summer nutrition benefit for struggling 
families--Summer EBT, electronic benefit transfer.
  Basically, that means millions of parents who rely on free or 
reduced-price meals to feed their kids during the school year will get 
help feeding their kids over the summer too. This has been a long time 
coming, and it is a huge deal that now this program is becoming 
permanent.
  Child hunger isn't just something I heard about from parents across 
my home State of Washington; it is personal to me. I remember what it 
was like when my family fell on hard times when I was young. Growing 
up, my parents had seven kids. It was never easy, but when my dad could 
no longer work because he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, it 
wasn't just hard, it was impossible.
  Fortunately for all of us, our country didn't just say ``tough 
luck.'' We got support. Food stamps helped put food on our table until 
my mom was able to go back to school and get a job. That was the 
difference between our family getting by or going hungry.
  I want to make sure that we are showing up for families today in the 
same way because the painful reality is that right now in this country, 
we have some 30 million kids for whom the free or reduced-price meals 
they get at school are the difference between them eating a real meal 
that day or going hungry.
  When summer comes, instead of feeling relief at getting a break from 
homework, many of these kids and their parents are worried about where 
they are going to get their next meal, until school starts again.
  It is heartbreaking, and in the richest country in the world, it is 
unacceptable. That is why back in 2010 I helped fund the first of its 
kind pilot program for summer EBT at USDA. The idea is pretty simple: 
Create a program that gives families benefits they can use at the 
grocery store to help feed their kids over the summer. One of the pilot 
sites was in Vancouver, WA. Do you know what? The program worked. Those 
benefits decreased the number of kids with very low food security by 
about a third and supported a much healthier diet because they got more 
fruits and vegetables.
  So to build off the success of that pilot program, in 2014, I 
introduced my Stop Child Summer Hunger Act. Rigorous evaluations made 
clear that benefit worked.
  Still, even if it seems like common sense and basic humanity that 
kids shouldn't go hungry, it has been a very long journey to finally 
get this idea passed into law.
  I reintroduced my bill several times with different colleagues. Then 
the pandemic struck and threw struggling families into even greater 
food insecurity. Everyone here remembers the enormous number of cars 
lined up outside food banks across the country in the early days of the 
pandemic.
  So I started working with my colleagues to establish a temporary 
nutrition program to see families through that crisis in the relief 
packages that we passed during the worst of the pandemic. In doing so, 
we were also able to show how necessary that kind of support is and how 
effective it is and establish a foundation that we then built on to 
pass a permanent summer nutrition program into law as part of our 
omnibus government funding bill at the end of 2022.
  I have to pause and really, really thank my great friend and 
colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan. She chairs the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, and she led on negotiating this big win for 
kids.
  Now that bill is going into effect, and what it means for families is 
that this summer, in participating States, like my home State of 
Washington, families whose kids qualify for free or reduced-price 
school meals during the school year will receive a preloaded nutrition 
benefits card worth about $120 per child to buy groceries over the 
summer. Unlike the pandemic-era program we passed, this program is 
permanent. Those benefits will work similar to SNAP, which means 
parents can use them to buy food at grocery stores, farmers markets, 
and more.
  In my home State alone, we are talking half a million kids who can 
benefit from this program. That is a meaningful step towards ending 
child hunger in America. But, as always, we have more work to do. No 
child should ever go hungry in the United States of America.
  While I don't think that is a controversial idea, my message to all 
my colleagues who agree is that achieving this takes more than words; 
it takes action. That means giving a hand to families like mine who 
fall on hard times. It means making sure parents who rely on school 
lunches for their kids can keep them fed in the summer months and fully 
funding WIC, which is a lifeline to so many women and infants. That is 
something I am very focused on right now, and I will not let up until 
we see that through.
  So I am here today not just to celebrate the important progress which 
I fought for years to make on fighting summer hunger but to make clear 
that I am not done fighting. I am going to keep pushing to make sure 
that no

[[Page S334]]

child goes hungry--no child--and that every family gets the same kind 
of support my family got when I was growing up.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                                 Israel

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, this is my 10th floor speech since 
the October 7 attack. Ten times I have stood here and told the 
hostages' stories. Ten times I have expressed their families' endless 
pain. But for every minute that I have stood here, the hostages and 
their families have lived lifetimes, an eternity in each moment.
  I have met so many families whose entire universe has been paralyzed. 
I have met mothers who are despondent, fathers who are desperate. They 
are living between hope and despair. They are asking themselves: Is my 
father alive? Is my daughter being raped every day? Is my husband being 
mistreated? Is my sister being fed?
  I recently met a family who says several of their loved ones were 
kidnapped by Hamas. Two escaped, and one was released, but one, 39-
year-old Carmel Gat, is still being held captive.
  She is an occupational therapist by training. Carmel had recently 
returned from a 3-month trip to India and was staying with her parents 
in Kibbutz Be'eri.
  On the morning of October 7, terrorists broke into her home. They 
took her mother to a street corner in the kibbutz and brutally murdered 
her. A few minutes later, they put Carmel into a car and drove her by 
that corner. That is how she learned her mother was killed.
  Released hostages who were with her told Carmel's family about the 
cruelty and the viciousness of the guards, but they also told them how 
brave Carmel was, defending and caring for the children being held in 
captivity, keeping them safe, teaching them how to turn within 
themselves, to meditate, to do yoga, to breathe, to give them some 
tools just to survive.
  Carmel was expected to be released on the eighth day of the November 
cease-fire, but just a few hours before it was her time to come home, 
the deal collapsed. Her family said they still haven't heard anything 
about her condition--whether she is alive, whether she is suffering, 
whether she will come home.
  Carmel is just one of the roughly 130 people still being held hostage 
by Hamas, including as many as 6 Americans. But she, like every other 
person whose life has been torn apart by this conflict, is not a 
statistic. She is a daughter. She is loved. Our hearts are with her, 
and we will not rest until she is home.
  I yield the floor.

         Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, for centuries, Native people have had 
everything stolen from them--their lands, their water, their language, 
their children.
  It wasn't that long ago it was the official policy of the U.S. 
Government to terminate--to terminate--the existence of Tribes and to 
forcibly assimilate their citizens. And a big part of that unrelenting, 
inhumane policy was that the remains of Native ancestors and culturally 
significant items were also taken from them, not with permission, but 
by force; not discovered, but stolen on battlefields and in cemeteries, 
under the cover of darkness or under guise of academic research.
  Think about that. The U.S. Government literally stole bones. Soldiers 
and agents overturned graves and took whatever they could find. And 
these were not isolated incidents. They happened all across the 
country. In my home State of Hawaii, the remains of Native Hawaiians--
or ``iwi kupuna,'' as they are called--were routinely pillaged without 
regard for the sanctity of burials or Native Hawaiian culture.
  All of it was brought to some of the most venerable institutions at 
home and abroad to be studied like biological specimens, displayed in 
museum exhibits as if they are paintings on loan or squirreled away in 
a professor's office closet never to be seen again.
  The theft of hundreds of thousands of remains and items over 
generations was unconscionable in and of itself, but the legacy of that 
cruelty continues to this very day because these museums and 
universities continue to hold onto these sacred items in violation of 
everything that is right and moral and, more importantly, in violation 
of Federal law.
  To remedy this injustice, Congress passed the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, in 1990. It required 
museums and universities to quickly return the remains and the items 
that they were holding that belonged to Native Hawaiians, Alaska 
Natives, and American Indians.
  At the time, the Congressional Budget Office anticipated that it 
would take about 5 years to complete the process of repatriation. 
Thirty-four years later, it is nowhere close to being done. In fact, 
experts recently estimated that at the current rate, it may take up to 
70 more years to complete the process. Why? Because these institutions, 
all otherwise well-respected and sought after, have done everything in 
their power to obstruct and obfuscate when confronted about their 
collections.
  They act as if this is some sort of impossible task, either 
administratively or determining the lineage or providence of an item. 
They purposefully mischaracterize items as ``culturally 
unidentifiable.'' Culturally unidentifiable.
  They engage with Native communities as little as possible. They 
``borrow'' collections from one another so they can never actually be 
held responsible for them. And maybe the most outrageous of all 
excuses, they claim that Tribes and Native groups lack the ability to 
take care of their own things--lack the ability to take care of their 
own items of cultural patrimony, bones stolen from graves.
  This smells of the worst kind of colonialism, with a thin veneer of 
progressive ideology and verbiage. University provosts and presidents 
can do all of the land acknowledgements that they want. They can post 
lengthy statements about equity on their websites and champion any 
number of progressive causes, but that rings hollow when they are at 
the same time clinging onto vast collections of stolen items because of 
a perverse, patronizing sense of ownership.
  This is not morally ambiguous. There is nothing to ponder here. The 
fact is these items do not belong in museums or universities or to 
science or academia. They belong to the Native people from which they 
came, which is why the Committee on Indian Affairs, where I am chair, 
held an oversight hearing on this issue almost 2 years ago and demanded 
explanations from the foremost offenders about their delays in 
repatriating these items.
  They are located all over the country: Ohio History Connection; the 
Illinois State Museum; Harvard University; University of California, 
Berkeley; and Indiana University. Together, these five institutions 
still hold at least 30,000 Native ancestral remains. These institutions 
have been responsive, and many have accelerated their repatriation 
efforts since.
  Earlier this month, Harvard, which has the third largest collection 
of these items in the country, pledged to cover the travel expenses of 
Native leaders to facilitate the repatriation process. Other museums, 
including the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum, 
have recently announced steps to finally comply with the Federal law. 
And yet there are still more than 70 other institutions holding almost 
58,000 ancestral remains. That is not counting the additional hundreds 
of thousands of cultural items in their collections.
  These museums and universities are everywhere: the University of 
Tennessee; the University of Kentucky; the University of Alabama; the 
University of Arizona; the University of Florida; the University of 
Missouri, Columbia; the University of Oklahoma; the Center for American 
Archaeology in Illinois; the University of Texas at Austin; the 
Milwaukee Public Museum; and so on. This is just a small sample, and I 
will enter the full list into the Record.
  But the point is this: We are not done. Our work is not over. These 
are

[[Page S335]]

supposedly liberal institutions who have no problem parroting whatever 
progressive expression is in vogue. And yet at the same time, they 
continue a colonial project against the explicit and repeated wishes of 
Native people. If you say you are for equal justice, for doing right by 
people of all backgrounds, then act like it. Return these remains and 
items to the Native people they belonged to all along.
  Some of the challenges when it comes to addressing past injustices in 
American history can seem so big as to be totally overwhelming. Where 
do you start? But this is not one of them. Returning these items 
matters, and the good news is it is imminently doable, but doable only 
if we collectively agree that getting this right is a necessary 
condition for justice to be restored.
  Doing this alone will not right past wrongs or somehow erase a long 
and brutal history of injustice. Of course, it won't. Native people 
still need money for water and electricity and healthcare. They still, 
as ever, need the unimpeded right to self-determination. But the least 
we can do--and I mean that, the least we can do--is enable them to tell 
their own stories and to define themselves, for themselves, to the rest 
of the world.
  Give the items back. Comply with Federal law. Hurry. Devote resources 
to this. Demonstrate in three dimensions that you care about the values 
that you espouse.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of institutions 
in possession of the repatriated remains be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                  Iran

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tensions in the Middle East have escalated 
dramatically since Hamas, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization, 
launched its war on Israel on October 7 of last year, killing innocent 
men, women, and children and taking and still holding up to 132 
hostages.
  Over the last few months, another Iranian proxy--Iran-backed 
militias--intensified their attacks throughout the region.
  There are Houthis in Yemen, there is Hezbollah in Lebanon, and, of 
course, as I mentioned, there are the attacks against Americans and 
American interests by Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria. These 
conflicts are playing out thousands of miles away from here, but we are 
not just a distant and disinterested spectator. Thousands of American 
troops are stationed in the region--not engaged in combat operations 
but in carrying out a range of security and intelligence missions and 
helping the residents and citizens of those nations defend themselves 
and

[[Page S332]]

provide a stabilizing force against what is the No. 1 state sponsor of 
terrorism, which is the Iranian regime.
  The presence of these American troops is vital to the stability of 
the region and, as I said, our own security interests. We may engage in 
wishful thinking, thinking that what happens over there doesn't affect 
us here. You would think that after 9/11--albeit it occurring some 23 
years ago now--it would have awakened us to the reality that what does 
happen in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle East. So it is 
important for us to provide stability operations and assistance, train-
and-assist operations, for our allies in the region in a very dangerous 
neighborhood.
  Since mid-October, Iranian-backed militia groups have attacked U.S. 
troops in the region more than 165 times--165 times. In less than 4 
months, U.S. troops have been targeted 165 times.
  This last weekend, the situation escalated dramatically when Iranian 
proxies targeted a U.S. military post in Jordan known as Tower 22. 
Tragically, these proxies of the Iranian regime--these militias--used a 
drone to attack the base, killing three American heroes as they slept.
  SGT William Rivers, SGT Kennedy Sanders, and SGT Breonna Moffett made 
the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country that night.
  These brave individuals were the first American servicemembers killed 
by enemy fire since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last October, but 
they are not the first Americans who have been targeted by the Iranian 
regime.
  The truth is, as you look back at the changes in Iran since the 
revolution in 1979, the Iranian regime has been in what you might call 
a low-grade war against America and American interests for the last 45 
years.
  Last month, two Navy SEALs were killed while seizing a vessel 
carrying Iranian-made arms intended for the Houthi rebels in Yemen. 
These brave SEALs and their comrades prevented the Houthis from 
receiving ballistic missiles and cruise missile components that could 
have been used to target U.S. forces or commercial traffic in the Red 
Sea or the nation of Israel.
  Today, I know our country mourns alongside of the families of each of 
those heroes, and we pray for the safety of the servicemembers who 
continue to serve our Nation providing these stability missions in the 
Middle East.
  But, as I said, the violence that we are seeing and experiencing in 
recent days is only a tragic continuation of Iran's decades-long proxy 
war against the United States. I said Iran is the No. 1 state sponsor 
of terrorism in the world. That is a fact. And the reason they operate 
through proxies is because they don't want to directly confront the 
United States because they fear American military might, as they 
should. But what they do is they will carry out terrorist attacks, 
having been equipped and trained and provided weapons by the Iranian 
regime, against innocent civilians and American servicemembers in the 
region.
  Of course, relations between the United States and Iran have been 
extremely fraught and violent since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when 
the country quickly transformed from a pro-Western democracy to an 
anti-Western theocracy. Its Supreme Leader is driven by a radical 
ideology and a deep hatred of the United States and the freedoms that 
we enjoy. He even referred to the United States as the ``Great Satan.''
  As we have witnessed over the last four-plus decades, that shift from 
a pro-democracy to an anti-American policy carried with it very serious 
consequences. Of course, many of us remember the Iranian hostage 
crisis. The movie ``Argo'' was written about getting some of the 52 
Americans out of Iran who had been held hostage for up to a year.
  Four years later, the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah in 
Lebanon bombed a Marine Corps barracks, killing 241 American 
servicemembers.
  And then, in 1996, Iran orchestrated an attack on U.S. Air Force 
personnel in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. A truck bomb was detonated next to a 
building housing American troops, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel 
and a local Saudi citizen and wounding 498 others.
  Then, during the war in Iraq, from 2003 to 2011, it became common 
knowledge that Iran was supplying the most dangerous form of 
munitions--explosively formed penetrators--that penetrate the armor of 
humvees and other up-armored vehicles that the U.S. forces were in and 
planted numerous IEDs, killing hundreds of American troops.
  And today, as our country is mourning the troops who were killed in 
Jordan last weekend at the hand of Iranian proxies, we need to be 
absolutely clear-eyed about the fact that this is not a new innovation. 
This isn't something that just happened in the last 2 days. This has 
been going on for 45 years.
  To be clear, this is not an exhaustive list of the violence Iran has 
unleashed against the United States and our interests. Sadly, this just 
scratches the surface. But it is important to look back at the history 
to understand the Iranian intentions toward the United States and our 
allies.
  Tehran has consistently waged acts of war against the United States. 
It has gone to great lengths to export terrorism around the globe, and 
it has engaged in gross human rights violations against its own people.
  Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, otherwise known as IRGC, is 
the loyal henchman responsible for leading these efforts. It is a 
branch of the Iranian Armed Forces that tries to squash democracy 
movements, both at home and abroad, by pushing its extreme ideology 
beyond Iran's borders. They provide training and equipment to 
terrorists which they use to kill innocent civilians--not just in 
Israel, not just in Syria and Iraq, not just in Lebanon, but even in 
the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen.
  The IRGC wields vast power and influence, and it uses its 
capabilities to spark turmoil throughout the Middle East. As I said, it 
provides arms, training, and foot soldiers to these terrorist groups.
  As the world has seen in recent months, those attacks are quickly 
intensifying. It is a grave cause for concern in a very dangerous 
neighborhood, the sort of escalation that we are seeing by Iran via its 
proxies. But the only responsible answer is for the United States to 
take swift and decisive action to respond to these attacks, because, if 
we don't, we are sure to be met with more.
  Sadly, I don't think the Biden administration has responded to this 
attack with the sort of decisiveness that it needs. As far as we know, 
the administration hasn't taken any action to target Iran's leaders, 
the IRGC, or the Quds Force--militarily, financially, or otherwise.
  We are told that the President has decided what he is going to do, 
but he is not sharing that with us. And, I fear, as more and more time 
goes by, the Iranian regime will not connect the killing of three 
American servicemembers in Iraq by Shia militias backed by Iran with 
whatever the subsequent kinetic attack against Iran's forces are.
  We are all watching to see what the coming days may hold, but I would 
like to encourage President Biden that, when it comes to Iran, there is 
no benefit to applying anything less than maximum pressure.
  Now, we are not talking about American boots on the ground. We are 
not talking about another war. We are talking about deterrence.
  So if there is no price to be paid for these repeated attacks against 
civilians and American servicemembers, they are going to continue. This 
is not a cost-benefit analysis made by the regime; this is pursuant to 
their radical ideology where they want to destroy Israel. And they call 
America the ``Great Satan''; so you know they don't mean us well.
  Iran's leaders must learn that the attacks on U.S. servicemembers and 
American interests will be returned in kind. Regardless of who carries 
out an attack--Iran or its proxies--the Iranian regime must be brought 
to account. It is the head of the octopus, and the tentacles are the 
proxies they use to commit mayhem and terrorism around the region. The 
only way to achieve deterrence and to prevent this conflict from 
widening is to teach the Iranian regime that these sorts of unilateral 
terrorist attacks will not be tolerated.

  Given the escalating tensions between our countries, President Biden 
can't continue promoting the same

[[Page S333]]

weak policies that he has embraced over the last few years, trying to 
appease the Iranian regime because he wants to get them back in the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran nuclear deal, 
negotiated under President Obama.
  He has lifted sanctions, which have allowed Iran to supply China and 
other countries oil, which has helped bolster their economy. They have 
continued to enrich uranium, getting closer and closer to a breakout 
for a nuclear weapon. As dangerous as Iran and its proxies are now, can 
you imagine what it would be like if they had a functioning nuclear 
weapon in the region?
  What would the response be of countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and 
other Arab countries that Iran has historically fought for control--not 
just geographic control but control as the leader of the Muslim world, 
according to their own brand of Islam.
  Unfortunately, in the messages that President Biden has sent over the 
last few years, from the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan without 
even notifying our allies--just pulling the plug and having the Taliban 
march in without a shot being fired--to the attempts to appease Iran in 
order to get back to the Iran nuclear deal, to the foolish decision to 
unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets, the Biden administration has 
projected an image of weakness when it comes to foreign policy.
  These missteps have sent a message to the Supreme Leader that he can 
continue to push until we push back. The Supreme Leader will naturally 
continue to test the limits of this administration to see how far he 
can go. We know what his ultimate aims are. We know the methods by 
which they act, and we don't need--we don't want--any more dead 
Americans because Iran continues to attack Americans and American 
allies in the Middle East.
  The root and foundation of all of this violence and instability in 
the Middle East is Iran. We can talk about Hezbollah, Hamas, the 
Houthis, and the Shia militias, but it is Iran that finances, equips, 
and trains these terrorists. That is true today, and it has been true 
literally for the last 45 years. From the Iran hostage crisis to the 
regime's outright support of terrorist groups in the Middle East, to 
the latest attack that killed three U.S. troops, Iran has demonstrated 
over and over and over again its unequivocal hatred of the United 
States.
  President Biden cannot hit Iran with kid gloves or allow the attacks 
on our servicemembers to go unanswered. It is a lesson that we have to 
learn, apparently, from history, time and time again, that appeasement 
is not a viable strategy when it comes to autocrats and dictators and 
terrorists. Appeasement doesn't work, and it is time for the President 
to impose crippling consequences on the Iranian regime, and I am 
talking about on the instruments of their terrorism, which is the IRGC 
and the Quds Force, which would be a good place to start.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

tempore of the U.S. Senate.


                               Summer EBT

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been fighting for over a decade to 
establish a new summer nutrition program to help end child hunger, and 
I come to the floor today to celebrate the tremendous progress we have 
made in that effort because, this year, legislation I fought to pass in 
2022 based on my Stop Child Hunger Act will go into effect, 
establishing a permanent summer nutrition benefit for struggling 
families--Summer EBT, electronic benefit transfer.
  Basically, that means millions of parents who rely on free or 
reduced-price meals to feed their kids during the school year will get 
help feeding their kids over the summer too. This has been a long time 
coming, and it is a huge deal that now this program is becoming 
permanent.
  Child hunger isn't just something I heard about from parents across 
my home State of Washington; it is personal to me. I remember what it 
was like when my family fell on hard times when I was young. Growing 
up, my parents had seven kids. It was never easy, but when my dad could 
no longer work because he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, it 
wasn't just hard, it was impossible.
  Fortunately for all of us, our country didn't just say ``tough 
luck.'' We got support. Food stamps helped put food on our table until 
my mom was able to go back to school and get a job. That was the 
difference between our family getting by or going hungry.
  I want to make sure that we are showing up for families today in the 
same way because the painful reality is that right now in this country, 
we have some 30 million kids for whom the free or reduced-price meals 
they get at school are the difference between them eating a real meal 
that day or going hungry.
  When summer comes, instead of feeling relief at getting a break from 
homework, many of these kids and their parents are worried about where 
they are going to get their next meal, until school starts again.
  It is heartbreaking, and in the richest country in the world, it is 
unacceptable. That is why back in 2010 I helped fund the first of its 
kind pilot program for summer EBT at USDA. The idea is pretty simple: 
Create a program that gives families benefits they can use at the 
grocery store to help feed their kids over the summer. One of the pilot 
sites was in Vancouver, WA. Do you know what? The program worked. Those 
benefits decreased the number of kids with very low food security by 
about a third and supported a much healthier diet because they got more 
fruits and vegetables.
  So to build off the success of that pilot program, in 2014, I 
introduced my Stop Child Summer Hunger Act. Rigorous evaluations made 
clear that benefit worked.
  Still, even if it seems like common sense and basic humanity that 
kids shouldn't go hungry, it has been a very long journey to finally 
get this idea passed into law.
  I reintroduced my bill several times with different colleagues. Then 
the pandemic struck and threw struggling families into even greater 
food insecurity. Everyone here remembers the enormous number of cars 
lined up outside food banks across the country in the early days of the 
pandemic.
  So I started working with my colleagues to establish a temporary 
nutrition program to see families through that crisis in the relief 
packages that we passed during the worst of the pandemic. In doing so, 
we were also able to show how necessary that kind of support is and how 
effective it is and establish a foundation that we then built on to 
pass a permanent summer nutrition program into law as part of our 
omnibus government funding bill at the end of 2022.
  I have to pause and really, really thank my great friend and 
colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan. She chairs the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, and she led on negotiating this big win for 
kids.
  Now that bill is going into effect, and what it means for families is 
that this summer, in participating States, like my home State of 
Washington, families whose kids qualify for free or reduced-price 
school meals during the school year will receive a preloaded nutrition 
benefits card worth about $120 per child to buy groceries over the 
summer. Unlike the pandemic-era program we passed, this program is 
permanent. Those benefits will work similar to SNAP, which means 
parents can use them to buy food at grocery stores, farmers markets, 
and more.
  In my home State alone, we are talking half a million kids who can 
benefit from this program. That is a meaningful step towards ending 
child hunger in America. But, as always, we have more work to do. No 
child should ever go hungry in the United States of America.
  While I don't think that is a controversial idea, my message to all 
my colleagues who agree is that achieving this takes more than words; 
it takes action. That means giving a hand to families like mine who 
fall on hard times. It means making sure parents who rely on school 
lunches for their kids can keep them fed in the summer months and fully 
funding WIC, which is a lifeline to so many women and infants. That is 
something I am very focused on right now, and I will not let up until 
we see that through.
  So I am here today not just to celebrate the important progress which 
I fought for years to make on fighting summer hunger but to make clear 
that I am not done fighting. I am going to keep pushing to make sure 
that no

[[Page S334]]

child goes hungry--no child--and that every family gets the same kind 
of support my family got when I was growing up.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                                 Israel

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, this is my 10th floor speech since 
the October 7 attack. Ten times I have stood here and told the 
hostages' stories. Ten times I have expressed their families' endless 
pain. But for every minute that I have stood here, the hostages and 
their families have lived lifetimes, an eternity in each moment.
  I have met so many families whose entire universe has been paralyzed. 
I have met mothers who are despondent, fathers who are desperate. They 
are living between hope and despair. They are asking themselves: Is my 
father alive? Is my daughter being raped every day? Is my husband being 
mistreated? Is my sister being fed?
  I recently met a family who says several of their loved ones were 
kidnapped by Hamas. Two escaped, and one was released, but one, 39-
year-old Carmel Gat, is still being held captive.
  She is an occupational therapist by training. Carmel had recently 
returned from a 3-month trip to India and was staying with her parents 
in Kibbutz Be'eri.
  On the morning of October 7, terrorists broke into her home. They 
took her mother to a street corner in the kibbutz and brutally murdered 
her. A few minutes later, they put Carmel into a car and drove her by 
that corner. That is how she learned her mother was killed.
  Released hostages who were with her told Carmel's family about the 
cruelty and the viciousness of the guards, but they also told them how 
brave Carmel was, defending and caring for the children being held in 
captivity, keeping them safe, teaching them how to turn within 
themselves, to meditate, to do yoga, to breathe, to give them some 
tools just to survive.
  Carmel was expected to be released on the eighth day of the November 
cease-fire, but just a few hours before it was her time to come home, 
the deal collapsed. Her family said they still haven't heard anything 
about her condition--whether she is alive, whether she is suffering, 
whether she will come home.
  Carmel is just one of the roughly 130 people still being held hostage 
by Hamas, including as many as 6 Americans. But she, like every other 
person whose life has been torn apart by this conflict, is not a 
statistic. She is a daughter. She is loved. Our hearts are with her, 
and we will not rest until she is home.
  I yield the floor.

         Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, for centuries, Native people have had 
everything stolen from them--their lands, their water, their language, 
their children.
  It wasn't that long ago it was the official policy of the U.S. 
Government to terminate--to terminate--the existence of Tribes and to 
forcibly assimilate their citizens. And a big part of that unrelenting, 
inhumane policy was that the remains of Native ancestors and culturally 
significant items were also taken from them, not with permission, but 
by force; not discovered, but stolen on battlefields and in cemeteries, 
under the cover of darkness or under guise of academic research.
  Think about that. The U.S. Government literally stole bones. Soldiers 
and agents overturned graves and took whatever they could find. And 
these were not isolated incidents. They happened all across the 
country. In my home State of Hawaii, the remains of Native Hawaiians--
or ``iwi kupuna,'' as they are called--were routinely pillaged without 
regard for the sanctity of burials or Native Hawaiian culture.
  All of it was brought to some of the most venerable institutions at 
home and abroad to be studied like biological specimens, displayed in 
museum exhibits as if they are paintings on loan or squirreled away in 
a professor's office closet never to be seen again.
  The theft of hundreds of thousands of remains and items over 
generations was unconscionable in and of itself, but the legacy of that 
cruelty continues to this very day because these museums and 
universities continue to hold onto these sacred items in violation of 
everything that is right and moral and, more importantly, in violation 
of Federal law.
  To remedy this injustice, Congress passed the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, in 1990. It required 
museums and universities to quickly return the remains and the items 
that they were holding that belonged to Native Hawaiians, Alaska 
Natives, and American Indians.
  At the time, the Congressional Budget Office anticipated that it 
would take about 5 years to complete the process of repatriation. 
Thirty-four years later, it is nowhere close to being done. In fact, 
experts recently estimated that at the current rate, it may take up to 
70 more years to complete the process. Why? Because these institutions, 
all otherwise well-respected and sought after, have done everything in 
their power to obstruct and obfuscate when confronted about their 
collections.
  They act as if this is some sort of impossible task, either 
administratively or determining the lineage or providence of an item. 
They purposefully mischaracterize items as ``culturally 
unidentifiable.'' Culturally unidentifiable.
  They engage with Native communities as little as possible. They 
``borrow'' collections from one another so they can never actually be 
held responsible for them. And maybe the most outrageous of all 
excuses, they claim that Tribes and Native groups lack the ability to 
take care of their own things--lack the ability to take care of their 
own items of cultural patrimony, bones stolen from graves.
  This smells of the worst kind of colonialism, with a thin veneer of 
progressive ideology and verbiage. University provosts and presidents 
can do all of the land acknowledgements that they want. They can post 
lengthy statements about equity on their websites and champion any 
number of progressive causes, but that rings hollow when they are at 
the same time clinging onto vast collections of stolen items because of 
a perverse, patronizing sense of ownership.
  This is not morally ambiguous. There is nothing to ponder here. The 
fact is these items do not belong in museums or universities or to 
science or academia. They belong to the Native people from which they 
came, which is why the Committee on Indian Affairs, where I am chair, 
held an oversight hearing on this issue almost 2 years ago and demanded 
explanations from the foremost offenders about their delays in 
repatriating these items.
  They are located all over the country: Ohio History Connection; the 
Illinois State Museum; Harvard University; University of California, 
Berkeley; and Indiana University. Together, these five institutions 
still hold at least 30,000 Native ancestral remains. These institutions 
have been responsive, and many have accelerated their repatriation 
efforts since.
  Earlier this month, Harvard, which has the third largest collection 
of these items in the country, pledged to cover the travel expenses of 
Native leaders to facilitate the repatriation process. Other museums, 
including the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum, 
have recently announced steps to finally comply with the Federal law. 
And yet there are still more than 70 other institutions holding almost 
58,000 ancestral remains. That is not counting the additional hundreds 
of thousands of cultural items in their collections.
  These museums and universities are everywhere: the University of 
Tennessee; the University of Kentucky; the University of Alabama; the 
University of Arizona; the University of Florida; the University of 
Missouri, Columbia; the University of Oklahoma; the Center for American 
Archaeology in Illinois; the University of Texas at Austin; the 
Milwaukee Public Museum; and so on. This is just a small sample, and I 
will enter the full list into the Record.
  But the point is this: We are not done. Our work is not over. These 
are

[[Page S335]]

supposedly liberal institutions who have no problem parroting whatever 
progressive expression is in vogue. And yet at the same time, they 
continue a colonial project against the explicit and repeated wishes of 
Native people. If you say you are for equal justice, for doing right by 
people of all backgrounds, then act like it. Return these remains and 
items to the Native people they belonged to all along.
  Some of the challenges when it comes to addressing past injustices in 
American history can seem so big as to be totally overwhelming. Where 
do you start? But this is not one of them. Returning these items 
matters, and the good news is it is imminently doable, but doable only 
if we collectively agree that getting this right is a necessary 
condition for justice to be restored.
  Doing this alone will not right past wrongs or somehow erase a long 
and brutal history of injustice. Of course, it won't. Native people 
still need money for water and electricity and healthcare. They still, 
as ever, need the unimpeded right to self-determination. But the least 
we can do--and I mean that, the least we can do--is enable them to tell 
their own stories and to define themselves, for themselves, to the rest 
of the world.
  Give the items back. Comply with Federal law. Hurry. Devote resources 
to this. Demonstrate in three dimensions that you care about the values 
that you espouse.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of institutions 
in possession of the repatriated remains be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

     representatives to Greece.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         transmittal no. 23-01

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The F-35A Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) 
     aircraft is a single seat, single engine, all-weather, 
     stealth, fifth-generation, multirole aircraft. It contains 
     sensitive technology including the low observable airframe/
     outer mold line, the Pratt and Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG-81 
     radar, an integrated core processor central computer, a 
     mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a multiple sensor 
     suite, technical data/documentation, and associated software.
       a. The Pratt and Whitney Fl35 engine is a single 40,000-lb 
     thrust class engine designed for the F-35 and assures highly 
     reliable, affordable performance. The engine is designed to 
     be utilized in all F-35 variants, providing unmatched 
     commonality and supportability throughout the worldwide base 
     of F-35 users.
       b. The AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) 
     is a high processing power/high transmission power electronic 
     array capable of detecting air and ground targets from a 
     greater distance than mechanically scanned array radars. It 
     also contains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which creates 
     high-resolution ground maps, provides weather data to the 
     pilot, and provides air and ground tracks to the mission 
     system, which uses it as a component to fuse sensor data.
       c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides 
     long-range detection and tracking as well as an infrared 
     search and track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) 
     capability for precision tracking, weapons delivery, and bomb 
     damage assessment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple separate 
     internal or podded systems typically found on legacy 
     aircraft.
       d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) 
     provides the pilot with full spherical coverage for air-to-
     air and air-to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
     enhancements, a fire control capability and precision 
     tracking of wingmen/friendly aircraft. The EODAS provides 
     data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission 
     system.
       e. The F-35 Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
     reprogrammable, integrated system that provides radar warning 
     and electronic support measures (ESM) along with a fully 
     integrated countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the 
     primary subsystem used to enhance situational awareness, 
     targeting support and self-defense through the search, 
     intercept, location, and identification of in-band emitters 
     and to automatically counter IR and RF threats.
       f. The F-35 Command, Control, Communications, Computers and 
     Intelligence/ Communications, Navigation, and Identification 
     (C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched 
     connectivity to flight members, coalition forces and the 
     battlefield. It is an integrated subsystem designed to 
     provide a broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and data 
     communications, precision radio navigation and landing 
     capability, self-identification, beyond visual range target 
     identification, and connectivity to off-board

[[Page S337]]

     sources of information. It also includes an inertial 
     navigation and global positioning system (OPS) for precise 
     location information. The functionality is tightly integrated 
     within the mission system to enhance efficiency.
       g. The F-35 C4I/CNI system includes two data links: the 
     Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The 
     MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for 
     stealthy communications among F-35s. Link-6 is an advanced 
     command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) 
     system incorporating jam-resistant, digital communication 
     links for exchange of near real-time tactical information, 
     including both data and voice, among air, ground, and sea 
     elements. It provides the warfighter key theater functions 
     such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons 
     engagement coordination, and direction for all services and 
     allied forces. Link-16 equipment allows the F-35 to 
     communicate with legacy aircraft using widely-distributed J-
     series message protocols.
       h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS) 
     provides a fully integrated logistics management solution. 
     ALGS integrates a number of functional areas, including 
     supply chain management, repair, support equipment, engine 
     support, and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a 
     state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time, 
     decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by 
     flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring 
     technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial 
     to predictive maintenance of vital components.
       i. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) 
     provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds 
     all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support 
     system. ALIS establishes the appropriate interfaces among the 
     F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system, 
     government information technology (IT) systems, and 
     supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ALIS 
     provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and 
     analysis, decision support, and action tracking.
       j. The F-35 Training System includes several training 
     devices to provide integrated training for pilots and 
     maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full 
     Mission Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission Rehearsal 
     Trainer (DMRT). The maintenance training devices include an 
     Aircraft Systems Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System 
     Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab, 
     Flexible Linear Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, Fl35 Engine 
     Module Trainer and Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT). The F-35 
     Training System can be integrated so both pilots and 
     maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center 
     (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and maintainers can train in 
     separate facilities (Pilot Training Center and Maintenance 
     Training Center).
       k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the 
     F-35's low observable air frame, Integrated Core Processor 
     (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS), 
     Pilot Life Support System (PLSS), Off-Board Mission Support 
     (OMS) System, and publications/ maintenance manuals. The HMDS 
     provides a fully sunlight readable, biocular display 
     presentation of aircraft information projected onto the 
     pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera 
     integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for separate 
     Night Vision Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of Pilot 
     Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Protection through use 
     of an On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS); and an 
     escape system that provides additional protection to the 
     pilot. OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Management System 
     (PTMS) air and enriches it by removing gases (mainly 
     nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increasing the concentration 
     of oxygen in the product gas and supplying breathable air to 
     the pilot. The OMS provides a mission planning, mission 
     briefing, and a maintenance/intelligence/tactical debriefing 
     platform for the F-35.
       2. The Electronic Warfare Reprogramming Lab is used by U.S. 
     Government engineers in the reprogramming and creation of 
     shareable Mission Data Files for foreign F-35 customers.
       3. The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader is a portable, hand-held 
     device used for securely receiving, storing, and transferring 
     data between compatible cryptographic and communications 
     equipment.
       4. The KGV-l35A is a high-speed, general purpose encryptor/
     decryptor module used for wide-band data encryption.
       5. The highest level of classification of defense articles, 
     components, and services included in this potential sale is 
     SECRET.
       6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures that 
     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the 
     development of a system with similar or advanced 
     capabilities.
       7. A determination has been made that Greece can provide 
     substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive 
     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale 
     is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
     national security objectives outlined in the Policy 
     Justification.
       8. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     Greece.

       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, 
     Greenville, SC. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any 
     offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the 
     purchaser and the contractor.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to Turkiye.
       There will be no adverse-impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         transmittal no. 23-07

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The F-16 Block 70 weapon system is a fourth generation 
     single-engine supersonic all-weather multirole fighter 
     aircraft and features advanced avionics and systems. It 
     contains the General Electric F110-129D engine, AN/APG-83 
     radar, digital flight control system, embedded internal 
     global navigation system, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems 
     (JHMCS) II or Scorpion Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker 
     (HObIT) with Night Vision Device (NVD) compatibility, 
     internal and external Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment, 
     Advanced IFF, Link-16 datalink, operational flight trainer, 
     and software and computer systems.
       a. General Electric F110-GE-129D engines are afterburning 
     turbofan jet engines that power the F-16.
       b. General Electric F110-GE-129D engine spare modules are 
     kits made up of spare engine components including the 
     following modules: inlet fan, core engine, fan drive turbine, 
     augmenter duct and nozzle, and gear box.
       c. The Modular Mission Computer (MMC) 7000AHC is the 
     central aircraft computer of the F-16. It serves as the hub 
     for all aircraft subsystems and avionics data transfer.
       d. The Improved Programmable Display Generator (iPDG) and 
     color multifunction displays utilize ruggedized commercial 
     liquid crystal display technology that is designed to 
     withstand the harsh environment found in modern fighter 
     cockpits. The display generator is the fifth generation 
     graphics processor for the F-16. Through the use of state-of-
     the-art microprocessors and graphics engines, it provided 
     orders of magnitude increases in throughput, memory, and 
     graphics capabilities.
       e. The APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) is an Active 
     Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar upgrade for the F-
     16. It includes higher processor power, higher transmission 
     power, more sensitive receiver electronics, and Synthetic 
     Aperture Radar (SAR), which creates higher-resolution ground 
     maps from a greater distance than existing mechanically 
     scanned array radars (e.g., APG-68). The upgrade features an 
     increase in detection range of air targets, increases in 
     processing speed and memory, and significant improvements in 
     all modes.
       f. The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial 
     Navigation System (GPS/INS) (EGI) with Selective Availability 
     Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)--or M-Code receiver when 
     available--and Precise Positioning Service (PPS) is a self-
     contained navigation system that provides the following: 
     acceleration, velocity, position, attitude, platform azimuth, 
     magnetic and true heading, altitude, body angular rates, time 
     tags, and coordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized time. 
     SAASM--or M-Code enables the GPS receiver access to the 
     encrypted P(Y or M) signal, providing protection against 
     active spoofing attacks.
       g. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System II (JHMCS II) or 
     Scorpion Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT) is a 
     device used in aircraft to project information to the pilot's 
     eyes and aids in tasks such as cueing weapons and aircraft 
     sensors to air and ground targets. This system projects 
     visual targeting and aircraft performance information on the 
     back of the helmet's visor, enabling the pilot to monitor 
     this information without interrupting their field of view 
     through the cockpit canopy. This provides improvement for 
     close combat targeting and engagement.
       h. The Integrated Electronic (EW) Warfare Suite provides 
     passive radar warning, wide spectrum Radio Frequency (RF) 
     jamming, and control and management of the entire EW system. 
     This system is anticipated to be internal to the aircraft, 
     although mounted pod variants are used in certain 
     circumstances.
       i. The Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) 
     Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) is a system capable 
     of transmitting and interrogating Mode V. Mode IV and Mode V 
     anti-jam performance specifications, data, software source 
     code, algorithms, and tempest plans or reports will not be 
     offered, released, discussed, or demonstrated.
       j. The Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS) 
     Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is a four-channel software 
     programmable radio for Link-16 digital voice communications 
     and datalink, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), and advanced 
     waveforms. Link-16 is a command, control, communications, and 
     intelligence (C3I) system incorporating high-capacity and 
     jam-resistant digital communication links for exchange of 
     near real-time tactical information, including both data and 
     voice, among air, ground, and sea elements.
       2. The LAU-129 Guided Missile Launcher is capable of 
     launching the AIM-9 family of missiles or AIM-120 AMRAAM. The 
     LAU-129 launcher serves as the mechanical and electrical 
     interface between missile and aircraft.
       3. The Triple Missile Launcher Adapter (TMLA) carries three 
     (3) missile launchers and missiles from a single standard 
     wing pylon.
       4. The M61 Vulcan Cannon is a six-barreled automatic 20mm 
     cannon with a cyclic rate of fire from 2,500-6,000 shots per 
     minute. This weapon is a hydraulically powered air-cooled

                    TRIBUTE TO GENERAL PAUL NAKASONE

  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the career of an exceptional public servant, GEN Paul Nakasone. General 
Nakasone is retiring from the Army after 37 years of military service, 
most recently as the Director of the National Security Agency and 
Commander of United States Cyber Command. He is a decorated combat 
veteran, and his career has been exceptional. His first operational 
tour of duty, in 1987, was at Fort Carson, CO, as an assistant 
intelligence officer. His tours since have brought him everywhere from 
Korea to Kansas, Georgia to Iraq, and to Fort Belvoir, the Pentagon, 
and Alexandria, VA.
  Over the last 6 years General Nakasone has led the women and men of 
the National Security Agency, ensuring that its unique, timely and 
accurate intelligence insights on topics of critical national security 
are delivered to warfighters, policymakers, and U.S. allies. As 
chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am a 
firsthand daily consumer of NSA's signals intelligence and analysis, 
and I cannot stress enough the importance, value, and insight it brings 
to us as policymakers.
  Under his leadership of NSA and concurrently, as Commander of U.S. 
Cyber Command, General Nakasone oversaw greater integration between 
U.S. Cyber Command and the NSA. He established several NSA 
organizations, including a Cybersecurity Directorate, a China Strategy 
Center, and the Cybersecurity Collaboration Center, to partner with 
private industry. He spearheaded the development of several successful 
joint NSA and Cyber Command teams such as the Russia Small Group on 
election security, which has been vital in securing U.S. elections 
through the last three election cycles.
  In 2018, during General Nakasone's first appearance before the 
committee as Director of the NSA, he told members that his priority 
coming into the position was the NSA workforce. He called them the core 
of the Agency and was adamant about assessing the challenges to 
retaining ``his talent'' and also recruiting more talent. He knew, as 
with any successful organization, the NSA relies on its brilliant and 
skilled workforce of intelligence professionals to accomplish its 
national security mission. Their well-being and success have been a 
priority for him throughout his tenure and during his nearly 20 
appearances before the committee. He helped to grow the next generation 
of intelligence analysts and collectors, mathematical scientists, 
linguists, and cybersecurity experts with programs such as Women in 
Cyber, cybersecurity and foreign language summer camps, codebreaker 
challenges, and with partnerships at colleges and universities across 
the country.
  In speaking of the next generation, I would be remiss in not sharing 
the incredible story of General Nakasone's father, retired Colonel 
Edwin Nakasone, known as Bud. On the morning of December 7, 1941, then 
14-year-old Bud Nakasone, now 96, was eating a bowl of corn flakes in 
his kitchen when he saw Japanese planes streaking through the skies, 
part of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. He saw the planes strafing 
the nearby barracks and saw a bomb drop on the nearby airfield. He saw 
U.S. planes, barracks, and hangars going up in flames. As one of the 
planes flew over their home, he saw on the plane ``the big red 
meatball''--what the military called the large red circle representing 
the Japanese Rising Sun--and in the cockpit, the Japanese pilot wearing 
goggles and a white scarf--and he realized we were at war.
  Bud Nakasone enlisted in the Army in 1945, and he served as an 
interpreter during the occupation of Japan. He later served both on 
Active Duty and with the Army Reserve, retiring after 41 years of 
service. He made his career as a high school teacher and college 
professor in Minnesota. General Nakasone's mother Mary was also an 
educator--a librarian at the University of Minnesota--when she met Bud. 
They were married in 1954 are still both living in Minnesota and will 
celebrate 70 years together this September.

[[Page S341]]

  General Nakasone has said that his father's career in the Army 
Reserve influenced his decision to enroll in the Army's ROTC program 
and that, when he started learning about the 442nd Infantry Regiment of 
the U.S. Army--a World War II fighting unit composed almost entirely of 
second-generation American soldiers of Japanese ancestry--and 
interviewed several of its veterans, he also became interested in 
serving.
  He has remarked that some of his most satisfying assignments included 
the privilege to command soldiers, including as a company commander 
while deployed along the demilitarized zone that separates North and 
South Korea.
  He is a big sports fan, including of the Minnesota Vikings, which 
means he knows how to keep a stiff upper lip when life brings 
disappointment or misfortune, whether in the form of a missed Gary 
Anderson field goal or a lengthy Senate hold. On General Nakasone's 
bio, it is noted that he and his wife Susan are the proud parents of 
four children, who form the nucleus of ``Team Nakasone,'' and I know 
how important their efforts and sacrifices have also been in allowing 
General Nakasone to take on assignments of increasing responsibility 
and importance to the security of the United States.
  On behalf of a grateful nation, as he transitions to future 
opportunities, I would like to publicly thank Paul for his long 
military career, his contributions to the Nation and our national 
security, and for his leadership of the intelligence professionals at 
the National Security Agency, and I want to personally thank the 
Nakasone family for their critical role in supporting him throughout 
his service to the Nation.
  Paul, thank you, and we will miss you.

                                 ______
                                 

                    TRIBUTE TO PEGGY GOLDWATER CLAY

<bullet> Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Peggy 
Goldwater Clay for her 20 years of service as the chair of the board of 
trustees of the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education 
Foundation. The Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education 
Foundation was established by Congress in 1986 to serve as a living 
memorial to honor the lifetime work of Senator Barry Goldwater, who 
served his country for 56 years as a soldier and statesman, including 
30 years in the U.S. Senate. Peggy Goldwater Clay is Senator 
Goldwater's youngest daughter.
  During Mrs. Clay's tenure, she enhanced the visibility and national 
reputation of the foundation by successfully promoting its mission and 
goals of seeking to identify, encourage, and financially support 
college sophomores and juniors who show exceptional promise of becoming 
this Nation's next generation of research leaders in the fields of 
natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics.
  As chair, Mrs. Clay promoted the foundation's modernization, 
effective communication, innovation, and collaboration with Tribal 
colleges, community colleges, 4-year universities, and other 
institutions.
  She approved, with unanimous board support, the technological 
improvements of the foundation's application process that transitioned 
it from paper to online applications and from in-person to virtual 
review. This effort greatly reduced the costs of processing the 
nominations received by the foundation from colleges and universities 
in all 50 States and U.S. Territories.
  Mrs. Clay encouraged and approved a 2014 survey of Goldwater 
Awardees, revealing that the outcomes desired when the foundation was 
established by Congress are being fulfilled; the survey showed that 
upwards of 70 percent of those who had been awarded Goldwater 
Scholarships had gone on to obtains Ph.Ds. in natural sciences, 
engineering, and mathematics and that a similar percentage had pursued 
research careers in these critical fields.
  She approved the inception of the Goldwater Scholar Faculty Mentor 
Award, a collaborative initiative between the Council on Undergraduate 
Research and the foundation that annually recognizes an outstanding 
faculty mentor of the Goldwater Scholars.
  Mrs. Clay endorsed a proposal, submitted by the foundation's 
president, that resulted in a $9 million grant from the Department of 
Defense Education Program. This grant enabled the foundation to nearly 
double the number of scholarships it awarded from 2019 to 2023.
  Also, during her tenure, Mrs. Clay helped establish the Barry 
Goldwater Educational Support fund, a scholars alumni organization 
known as the Goldwater Scholar Community, a new undergraduate research 
internship initiative, and a strategy to enhance the diversity of 
Goldwater Scholarship Awardees.
  The foundation received a direct $2 million congressional 
appropriation in 2022 to further support its scholarship awards. In 
2021, Congress reauthorized the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and 
Excellence in Education Foundation. These accomplishments would not 
have been possible without Mrs. Clay's efforts.
  I, along with the board of trustees of the Barry Goldwater 
Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation, express sincere 
gratitude and profound appreciation for Peggy Goldwater Clay's long, 
tireless, and inspired service as chair of the board of 
trustees.<bullet>

   REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING A 
 NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT POSED BY THE SITUATION IN 
THE WEST BANK, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR HIGH LEVELS OF EXTREMIST SETTLER 
  VIOLENCE, FORCED DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE AND VILLAGES, AND PROPERTY 
                           DESTRUCTION--PM 36

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), section 212(f) and section 215(a) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 8 U.S.C. 1185(a)), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report that I have 
issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to deal with 
the threat posed by the situation in the West Bank, including in 
particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced 
displacement of people and villages, and property destruction. Such 
actions constitute a serious threat to the peace, security, and 
stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle 
East region and undermine the foreign policy and national security 
objectives of the United States. I find that these actions constitute 
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, and I have declared a national 
emergency to deal with that threat.
  The order authorizes the blocking of property and interests in 
property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
  (i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or 
indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions--including 
directing, enacting, implementing, enforcing, or failing to enforce 
policies--that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West 
Bank;

[[Page S342]]

  (ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or 
indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, planning, ordering, 
otherwise directing, or participating in certain actions--including 
acts of violence or threats of violence targeting civilians, efforts to 
place civilians in reasonable fear of violence, property destruction, 
or seizure or dispossession of property by private actors--affecting 
the West Bank;
  (iii) to be or have been a leader or official of certain entities 
that have engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, such 
activities;
  (iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, any person blocked pursuant to the order; or
  (v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person blocked 
pursuant to the order.
  The order also authorizes the blocking of property and interests in 
property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to have committed or 
have attempted to commit, to pose a significant risk of committing, or 
to have participated in training to commit acts of terrorism affecting 
the West Bank. In addition, the order suspends the entry into the 
United States of any noncitizen determined to meet one or more of the 
above criteria.
  The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the 
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted 
to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes 
of the order. It directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, to implement the order as it 
applies to visas, and it directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to implement the order as it 
applies to the entry into the United States of noncitizens. All 
executive departments and agencies of the United States are directed to 
take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement the 
order.
  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, February 1, 2024.

     SENATE RESOLUTION 541--SUPPORTING THE OBSERVATION OF NATIONAL 
   TRAFFICKING AND MODERN SLAVERY PREVENTION MONTH DURING THE PERIOD 
BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2024, AND ENDING ON FEBRUARY 1, 2024, TO RAISE 
 AWARENESS OF, AND OPPOSITION TO, HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MODERN SLAVERY

  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Wyden, 
Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal, 
Mr. Brown, and Ms. Butler) submitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 541

       Whereas the United States abolished the transatlantic slave 
     trade in 1808 and abolished chattel slavery and prohibited 
     involuntary servitude in 1865;
       Whereas, because the people of the United States remain 
     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a 
     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking and modern 
     slavery, which is commonly considered to mean--
       (1) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, 
     or obtaining of an individual through the use of force, 
     fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting that 
     individual to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, 
     or slavery; or
       (2) the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, 
     or coercion, or in which the individual induced to perform 
     that act is younger than 18 years of age;
       Whereas forced labor and human trafficking generates 
     revenues of at least $150,000,000,000 annually worldwide, and 
     there are an estimated 50,000,000 victims of human 
     trafficking and modern slavery across the globe;
       Whereas victims of human trafficking are difficult to 
     identify and are subject to manipulation, force, fraud, 
     coercion, and abuse;
       Whereas children and youths experiencing homelessness are 
     vulnerable and susceptible to manipulation, making them a 
     prime target for the lucrative criminal industry of human 
     trafficking;
       Whereas the Department of Justice has reported that human 
     trafficking and modern slavery has been reported and 
     investigated in each of the 50 States and the District of 
     Columbia;
       Whereas the Department of State has reported that the top 3 
     countries of origin of federally identified human trafficking 
     victims in the United States in fiscal year 2021 were the 
     United States, Mexico, and Honduras;
       Whereas, to help businesses in the United States combat 
     child labor and forced labor in global supply chains, the 
     Department of Labor has identified 159 goods from 78 
     countries that are made by child labor and forced labor;
       Whereas, since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline 
     has identified 82,301 situations of human trafficking 
     involving 164,839 victims;
       Whereas there are known risk factors that contribute to 
     youths running away, including domestic violence, child 
     sexual abuse, and neglect, and runaway youths who experience 
     homelessness are potential targets for human trafficking;
       Whereas, in 2023, the National Center for Missing and 
     Exploited Children received over 18,400 reports of possible 
     child sex trafficking;

[[Page S349]]

       Whereas, of the more than 28,800 missing children reported 
     to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 
     2023, 1 in 6 were likely victims of child sex trafficking;
       Whereas today, the average age of child sex trafficking 
     victims reported missing to the National Center for Missing 
     and Exploited Children is only 15 years old;
       Whereas youth experiencing homelessness experience high 
     rates of human trafficking, and 1 in 5 homeless youths is a 
     victim of sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or both;
       Whereas 22 percent of youths who experience homelessness 
     were approached for paid sex on their first night of 
     homelessness;
       Whereas LGBTQ youths are disproportionally affected, 
     accounting for 33.8 percent of sex trafficking victims;
       Whereas youths facing homelessness have a lower probability 
     of being trafficked if they have a supportive adult in their 
     life;
       Whereas the Administration for Native Americans of the 
     Department of Health and Human Services reports that American 
     Indian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander women and girls 
     have a heightened risk for sex trafficking;
       Whereas the Department of Justice found that studies on the 
     topic of human trafficking of American Indians and Alaska 
     Natives suggest there are--
       (1) high rates of sexual exploitation of Native women and 
     girls;
       (2) gaps in data and research on trafficking of American 
     Indian and Alaska Native victims; and
       (3) barriers that prevent law enforcement agencies and 
     victim service providers from identifying and responding 
     appropriately to Native victims;
       Whereas, according to the Government Accountability Office, 
     from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2016, there were 
     only 14 Federal investigations and 2 Federal prosecutions of 
     human trafficking offenses in Indian country;
       Whereas, to combat human trafficking and modern slavery in 
     the United States and globally, the people of the United 
     States, the Federal Government, and State, Tribal, and local 
     governments must be--
       (1) aware of the realities of human trafficking and modern 
     slavery; and
       (2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enterprise of human 
     trafficking and modern slavery;
       Whereas the United States should hold accountable all 
     individuals, groups, organizations, governments, and 
     countries that support, advance, or commit acts of human 
     trafficking and modern slavery;
       Whereas, through education, the United States must also 
     work to end human trafficking and modern slavery in all forms 
     in the United States and around the world;
       Whereas victims of human trafficking deserve a trauma-
     informed approach that integrates the pursuit of justice and 
     provision of social services designed to help them escape, 
     and recover from, the physical, mental, emotional, and 
     spiritual trauma they endured;
       Whereas combating human trafficking requires a whole-of-
     government effort that rests on a unified and coordinated 
     response among Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies and 
     that places equal value on the prevention of trafficking, the 
     identification and stabilization of victims, and the 
     investigation and prosecution of traffickers;
       Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking 
     and to assist and protect victims of human trafficking and 
     modern slavery have been enacted in the United States, 
     including--
       (1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 
     U.S.C. 7101 et seq.);
       (2) title XII of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization 
     Act of 2013 (Public Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 136);
       (3) the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 
     (Public Law 114-22; 129 Stat. 227);
       (4) sections 910 and 914(e) of the Trade Facilitation and 
     Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-125; 130 Stat. 
     239 and 274);
       (5) section 1298 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 7114);
       (6) the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017 (Public Law 
     115-392; 132 Stat. 5250);
       (7) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017 (Public 
     Law 115-393; 132 Stat. 5265);
       (8) the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention 
     and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-
     425; 132 Stat. 5472);
       (9) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act 
     of 2017 (Public Law 115-427; 132 Stat. 5503);
       (10) the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 
     2022 (Public Law 117-103; 136 Stat. 840);
       (11) the Abolish Trafficking Reauthorization Act of 2022 
     (Public Law 117-347; 136 Stat. 6199);
       (12) the Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection 
     Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-348; 136 Stat. 
     6211); and
       (13) the End Human Trafficking in Government Contracts Act 
     of 2022 (Public Law 117-211; 136 Stat. 2248);
       Whereas the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 
     (Public Law 114-22; 129 Stat. 227) established the United 
     States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to provide a 
     formal platform for survivors of human trafficking to advise 
     and make recommendations on Federal anti-trafficking policies 
     to the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat 
     Trafficking established by the President;
       Whereas the Department of Defense, the General Services 
     Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space 
     Administration issued a final rule (80 Fed. Reg. 4967) to 
     implement Executive Order 13627, entitled ``Strengthening 
     Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal 
     Contracts'', that clarifies the policy of the United States 
     on combating trafficking in persons as outlined in the 
     Federal Acquisition Regulation by strengthening the 
     prohibition on contractors from charging employee recruitment 
     fees;
       Whereas, although such laws and regulations are currently 
     in force, it is essential to increase public awareness, 
     particularly among individuals who are most likely to come 
     into contact with victims of human trafficking and modern 
     slavery, regarding conditions and dynamics of human 
     trafficking and modern slavery, precisely because traffickers 
     use techniques that are designed to severely limit self-
     reporting and evade law enforcement;
       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date 
     of the Emancipation Proclamation;
       Whereas February 1 is--
       (1) the anniversary of the date on which President Abraham 
     Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending the 13th 
     Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to the 
     States for ratification to forever declare, ``Neither slavery 
     nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime 
     whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist 
     within the United States, or any place subject to their 
     jurisdiction''; and
       (2) a date that has long been celebrated as National 
     Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title 36, United 
     States Code; and
       Whereas, under the authority of Congress to enforce the 
     13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ``by 
     appropriate legislation'', Congress, through the Trafficking 
     Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), 
     updated the post-Civil War involuntary servitude and slavery 
     statutes and adopted an approach of victim protection, 
     vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking, 
     commonly known as the ``3P'' approach: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate supports--
       (1) observing National Trafficking and Modern Slavery 
     Prevention Month during the period beginning on January 1, 
     2024, and ending on February 1, 2024, to recognize the vital 
     role that the people of the United States have in ending 
     human trafficking and modern slavery;
       (2) marking the observation of National Trafficking and 
     Modern Slavery Prevention Month with appropriate programs and 
     activities, culminating in the observance on February 1, 
     2024, of National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of 
     title 36, United States Code;
       (3) urging continued partnerships with Federal, State, 
     Tribal, and local agencies, as well as survivors of human 
     trafficking, social service providers, and nonprofit 
     organizations to address human trafficking with a 
     collaborative, victim-centered approach; and
       (4) all other efforts to prevent, eradicate, and raise 
     awareness of, and opposition to, human trafficking and modern 
     slavery.

  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 27--RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR RESEARCH, 
   EDUCATION, AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT REGARDING HIGH-POTENCY MARIJUANA

  Mr. RICKETTS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:

                            S. Con. Res. 27

       Whereas the use of high-potency marijuana has become 
     increasingly prevalent across the United States;
       Whereas the average potency of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
     (commonly known as ``THC''), the major psychoactive component 
     in marijuana, increased by 287 percent between 1995 and 2021, 
     from 3.96 percent potency to 15.34 percent potency;
       Whereas adolescent and teen marijuana abuse increased by 
     245 percent from 2000 to 2020;
       Whereas the perceived risk of weekly marijuana use 
     decreased from 47.5 percent to 27.4 percent among adolescents 
     in the past decade;
       Whereas cannabis use disorder among teens increased by 25 
     percent after the enactment of recreational marijuana 
     legalization;
       Whereas increased potency levels correspond with greater 
     health risks, with research showing that daily use of THC 
     with a potency greater than 15 percent results in a 5 times 
     increased risk of psychosis;
       Whereas only 3 States have enacted potency caps on 
     marijuana flower or concentrates;
       Whereas the use of high-potency marijuana has been linked 
     to potential adverse health effects, including mental health 
     disorders and cognitive impairment;
       Whereas education and awareness programs are essential to 
     inform the public about the potential risks associated with 
     the use of high-potency marijuana; and
       Whereas a bipartisan effort is necessary to develop 
     evidence-based policies to address the increasing prevalence 
     of high-potency marijuana: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring),

[[Page S350]]

  


     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This concurrent resolution may be cited as the ``Randy's 
     Resolution''.

     SEC. 2. RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND 
                   POLICY DEVELOPMENT REGARDING HIGH-POTENCY 
                   MARIJUANA.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     Federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the 
     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, should conduct 
     and support research on the health effects of high-potency 
     marijuana and its impact on vulnerable populations such as 
     youth.
       (b) Resolving Matters.--Congress--
       (1) supports the development of educational programs at the 
     Federal, State, and local levels to inform the public about 
     the potential risks associated with the use of high-potency 
     marijuana, especially among youth; and
       (2) urges Federal, State, and local governments to 
     collaborate with public health organizations, medical 
     professionals, and community stakeholders to develop 
     evidence-based policies that address the public health and 
     safety concerns associated with high-potency marijuana.

                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come 
before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous 
order following the remarks of Senator Duckworth.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.


                                  Iran

  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, if you listen closely right now, you 
can hear the drums of war gain momentum. I know that sound. It is the 
same sound that led me to deploy to a dusty desert outpost in Iraq 20 
years ago, where I served alongside some of the bravest men and women 
you could ever meet. It is the same sound that, ultimately, led me to 
run for office, a decision I only made after I was shot down in Iraq, 
when I found myself searching for a new mission to serve my Nation.
  I found that mission in giving a voice to every veteran who had 
willingly sacrificed so much answering their Nation's call to serve, 
and I found it in speaking up for the Active-Duty troops still waking 
up in dusty base camps throughout the Middle East, still serving tour 
after tour, bleeding--even dying--thousands of miles away because they 
had sworn an oath to defend a country they loved, no matter what it 
cost them.
  And that sound is why, a few minutes ago, I wheeled myself to this 
desk with the same purpose that took me first to battle, then the 
campaign trail: And that is to help keep America as strong as she can 
be and to try to look out for the troops who never stop looking out for 
the rest of us.
  Today, I am here in this beautiful chamber with privilege all around 
me to beg of my colleagues one simple thing: As tensions in the Middle 
East escalate, please, from this place of safety and comfort, think of 
the sacrifices our servicemembers make every single day. Please, as the 
drums of war grow louder, honor our servicemembers by thinking of what 
we would be asking them to risk if we risk an expanded conflict with 
Iran.
  On Sunday morning, we all woke to the tragic, horrific news that 
three American soldiers were killed in an Iran-backed attack in Jordan. 
I imagine many who saw the news may not have even known that we had 
U.S. servicemembers stationed in Jordan, but I was acutely aware of it. 
In fact,

[[Page S351]]

just 24 hours earlier, I had woken up in Illinois and helped to send 
almost 300 Illinois National guardsmen off to start their mission in 
the CENTCOM area of operation, the exact AO where this attack took 
place.
  And since Sunday, I don't think I have gone a waking hour without 
thinking about the brave servicemembers who lost their lives--SGT 
William Jerome Rivers, SGT Kennedy Ladon Sanders, and SGT Breonna 
Alexsondria Moffett--and each of them was willing to sacrifice the 
unimaginable to keep our Nation safe. They are our heroes.
  During this impossible time, my thoughts are with their families, who 
will never be able to say ``I love you'' in person to them again. And 
my thoughts are with the more than 40 other servicemembers who were 
wounded in the blast, with at least three among them having severe 
enough injuries that they had to be evacuated to Germany.
  It is clear that we must forcefully and swiftly make those 
responsible pay for the devastation they have wrought and send a 
message that these attacks against our servicemembers will not be 
tolerated. But we must do this with clear eyes, a steady hand, and a 
clear, strategic end goal in mind, seeking justice and, ultimately, a 
swift end to these threats to our troops.
  I don't have all the details yet, but based on initial reports, it 
seems that President Biden's planned response will do just that. It 
looks like it will be a well-thought-out, strong rebuttal that aims to 
deter Iran from supporting further attacks on U.S. troops without 
risking boiling tensions even further, because this is a uniquely 
dangerous moment, and the message we send to Iran must make war less 
likely, not more.
  After all, after decades of forever wars in the region, the last 
thing we want is to send those who volunteer to serve our country into 
another endless, senseless conflict. And if we want to adequately honor 
the sacrifices of the three servicemembers killed last week, we must 
remain focused on preventing their brothers and sisters at arms from 
dying in a preventable war on foreign soil.
  Sadly, over the past few days, some of my Republican colleagues have 
been making reckless, irresponsible comments that risk dangerously 
escalating tensions. They have been throwing rocks, chest thumping over 
social media, beating the drums of war, demanding that the President 
ramp up the temperature, that he ``hit Iran now and hit them hard.''
  Look, I ran for Congress so that when those drums of war started 
beating, I would be in a position to make sure that our leaders in 
Washington fully consider the cost of war--not just in dollars and 
cents but in the sacrifices and blood of our troops. So I have come to 
the floor today, as those drums echo louder than they have in years, to 
keep my promise to do our troops justice, to beseech my colleagues to 
let cool heads, common sense, and sound strategy prevail over reckless 
impulses.
  And, if necessary, I will come back to this Chamber day after day 
after day, speaking from this wheelchair that I earned the last time 
Congress rashly sent our sons and daughters into another endless, 
senseless war, ensuring that, this time, we do right by our troops by 
fully, soberly, considering the consequences of these decisions on 
those who serve and their families.
  Listen, I am no dove. After all, I volunteered to fight in a war that 
I deeply disagreed with. So I am certainly not opposed to war when it 
is necessary to defend this great Nation. And I am not opposed to 
striking Iranian assets, if our approach is smart, limited, and 
strategically calibrated to end the spiral of violence that threatens 
our servicemembers.
  But I will also do everything in my power to remind those who, today, 
are so eagerly pushing us down the path to war that there are serious 
repercussions involved for the Americans who would actually be in 
harm's way, even if they may not be filled by politicians here in 
Washington.
  Under both the Federal law known as the War Powers Act and article I 
of the Constitution, only Congress has the solemn responsibility of 
deciding when and how the United States sends its troops into war.
  So if Republicans really want to risk war with Iran, then they owe it 
to our troops to bring an authorization for use of military force to 
the floor. Instead of hiding behind social media accounts and 
television interviews, bring that debate to this Chamber so we can 
actually fulfill our duty and begin the serious business of considering 
the merits and drawbacks of such a conflict.
  So that as we ask them to sacrifice so much, our troops downrange 
would at least know what their mission is, what their goals are, and 
that their leaders in Washington both have their backs and are 
following the Constitution that they are willing to die to protect and 
defend.
  Whenever Republicans are ready--if they are ever ready--I am here to 
participate in that debate. And if their arguments for war are strong 
enough, I owe it to my constituents to consider and vote on the merits 
of them.
  I, myself, would be the first to volunteer, if they could have use of 
a gimpy former Black Hawk pilot, but I will go. I can pack my ruck in 
15 minutes, if needed. But for now, with those drums pounding once 
more, I just want to ask each of my colleagues to take a moment to 
think about the true cost of war for all those servicemembers still at 
risk at dusty desert bases thousands of miles away.
  I personally cannot go a moment without forgetting them.
  I yield the floor.

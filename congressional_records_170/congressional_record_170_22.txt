        BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING ELSIE McPHERSON-BROWN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the groundbreaking service of 
a Livingston County woman who never even planned to live in the area, 
much less to make history there. Fortunately, life had its own plans 
for Elsie McPherson-Brown, and the community is so much better for it.
  Livingston County sits at the crossroads of several major highways, 
and when Elsie McPherson-Brown, was driving one of them to visit 
friends, she took a wrong turn and ended up in the northern community 
of Hartland. Elsie liked what she saw on that unexpected outing, and 
after further investigation, including meeting with the superintendent 
and school principals, she convinced her husband to relocate to 
Hartland from Detroit with their two elementary school-aged boys.
  It's worth noting that Livingston County was, and remains to this 
day, an overwhelmingly white community, but Elsie and her family were 
undeterred. From the beginning of their time in Hartland, Elsie dove 
into community service, volunteering in her kids' classrooms, 
organizing fundraisers, chairing Teacher Appreciation Day events, and 
serving on the PTO. In 2003, Elsie took her service to a new and 
historic level, when she successfully ran for the Board of Education of 
Hartland Consolidated Schools, becoming the first African-American 
woman and only the second African-American in modern history to be 
elected to public office in Livingston County.
  Her story is not without its challenges, particularly when it comes 
to race relations. She often shares how a grocery store manager 
insisted her personal check was fraudulent because he refused to 
believe that a Black woman lived in Livingston County as the address 
stated. Or the local police officers who questioned her younger son and 
refused to believe he was simply heading home for the same reason. But 
Elsie chose to rise above, and set her focus and her intentions on the 
things she loved about the community and the commonalities she shared 
with her friends and neighbors.
  Supported by the voters, Elsie served ten years on the school board 
and fulfilled her goal of having a voice in shaping the education of 
the next generation. She was known for her calm demeanor, her colorful 
outfits, and the many hats she wore about town, perhaps representative 
of the different hats she wore in life: wife, mother, advocate, and 
trailblazer. While she has stepped down from public office, today she 
continues her life of quiet service to the community in her work with 
the Livingston County Sheriffs Office.
  Elsie McPherson-Brown may have stumbled upon Hartland accidentally, 
but it's no accident that she changed the course of Hartland's history. 
Her story deserves to be told, uplifted, and forever preserved.

                          ____________________

     ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 2024 CONGRESS-BUNDESTAG/BUNDESRAT EXCHANGE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE JOHNSON

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, since 1983, the U.S. Congress 
(House and Senate) and the German Bundestag and Bundesrat have 
conducted an annual exchange program for staff members from both 
countries. The program gives professional staff the opportunity to 
observe and learn about each other's political institutions and engage 
in discussion regarding mutual interest.
  A staff delegation from the U.S. Congress will be selected to visit 
Germany from Friday, June 28-Sunday, July 7, 2024. During this 
exchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag/Bundesrat 
party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, 
business, academic and media agencies.
  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United 
States from Saturday, September 14-Sunday, September 22, 2024. They 
will attend similar meetings in Washington organized by the members of 
the U.S. delegation.
  The Congress-Bundestag/Bundesrat Exchange is highly regarded in 
Germany and the United States and is one of several exchange programs 
sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and 
Germany to foster better understanding of the politics and policies of 
both countries. This exchange is funded by the U.S. Department of 
State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
  The U.S. delegation shall consist of experienced and accomplished 
Hill staff who can contribute to the success of the exchange on both 
sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag reciprocates by sending senior 
staff professionals to the United States.
  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. 
Applicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, 
although such a background can be helpful. The composite U.S. 
delegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual 
concern to the United States and Germany such as, but not limited to, 
trade, security, the environment, economic development, health care, 
and other social policy issues. This year's delegation should be 
familiar with transatlantic relations within the context of recent 
world events.
  Please note that there is a significant time commitment aspect for 
those selected for the program. In addition, U.S. participants are 
expected to plan and implement the meetings and programs for the 
Bundestag/Bundesrat staff members when they visit the United States.
  Members of the House and Senate who would like a member of their 
staff to apply for participation in this year's program should direct 
them to submit a resume and cover letter in which they state their 
qualifications, the contributions they can make to a successful program 
and some assurances of their ability to participate during the time 
stated.
  Applications should be sent to the Office of Interparliamentary 
Affairs, HC-4, the Capitol, by 5 p.m. on Friday, March 8, 2024. Please 
submit the application and any questions to

IMPEACHING ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, 
                    FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, this extreme MAGA 
Republican stunt to impeach Secretary Mayorkas is baseless. The 
Democratic staff of the Committee on Homeland Security thoroughly 
documented the many failures of fact and law in the articles of 
impeachment contained in H. Res. 863. I include in the Record the key 
findings and introduction of the Democratic staff report. The full 
report can be found online at <a href='https://democratshomeland.house.gov/
download/homelanddemimpeachmentreportfinal'>https://democratshomeland.house.gov/
download/homelanddemimpeachmentreportfinal</a>.

                                   Committee on Homeland Security,


                                        Minority Staff Report,

                                                 January 29, 2024.


                              key findings

       Republicans are abusing Congress' impeachment power. 
     Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy under the United 
     States Constitution. It is not a tool for policy or political 
     differences, and constitutional scholars and even some 
     Republicans agree. The Framers never intended for the 
     legislative branch to wield its impeachment power to extort 
     policy changes from the executive branch, and they certainly 
     did not intend for the impeachment power to be used to 
     placate extreme factions of Congress.
       The Republicans' impeachment scheme is a sham. Republicans' 
     baseless investigation into Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is a 
     politically motivated sham to appease extreme MAGA Members 
     and partisan special interest groups. This impeachment has 
     never been about Secretary Mayorkas' record, as the effort 
     began not long after he was confirmed. In their rush to reach 
     a predetermined outcome, House Republicans have failed to 
     provide the most basic due process considerations to 
     Secretary Mayorkas.
       Secretary Mayorkas is upholding the law and honoring the 
     public trust. Secretary Mayorkas has not violated the law, 
     let alone committed ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--the 
     Constitutional standard for

[[Page E122]]

     impeachment. Secretary Mayorkas is carrying out President 
     Biden's policies in good faith within resource constraints. 
     He is following the law and has been responsive to Congress 
     and the American people.
       Republicans are sabotaging Secretary Mayorkas' efforts to 
     secure the border. The Biden administration--including 
     Secretary Mayorkas--is working to solve the challenges at our 
     border in an orderly, humane, and lawful way. Secretary 
     Mayorkas has implemented new initiatives to stop dangerous 
     drugs from entering our communities; cracked down on 
     smugglers and cartels; and increased personnel, technology, 
     and infrastructure at our borders. Unfortunately, Republicans 
     are intentionally sabotaging these efforts by voting against 
     necessary funding because they prefer a political wedge issue 
     to policy solutions.
       Republicans are perpetuating challenges at the border to 
     help re-elect Donald Trump. Republicans are using Secretary 
     Mayorkas as a scapegoat for the longstanding challenges at 
     our southern border. They are playing the political blame-
     game to deflect attention from their failure to take 
     meaningful action on border security and immigration 
     legislation and provide necessary border security funding. 
     Republicans should stop this sham effort and instead work 
     with Democrats to enact border and immigration legislation 
     and provide the Department of Homeland Security the funding 
     it needs to carry out its mission.


                            I. INTRODUCTION

       Since its formation in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 
     September 11, 2001, the Committee on Homeland Security (the 
     Committee) has distinguished itself through dedication to 
     serious legislative and oversight work under the leadership 
     of chairmen from both parties. The frantic, partisan rush to 
     consider House Resolution 863, Impeaching Alejandro Nicholas 
     Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, for high crimes and 
     misdemeanors, represents a betrayal of that hard-earned 
     legacy.
       Sadly, in the 118th Congress, the willingness of 
     Republicans to waste their credibility on political stunts 
     comes as no surprise. MAGA Republicans have wasted their 
     opportunity to make progress on immigration and border 
     security policy. The challenges at our borders are real--but 
     Republicans have failed even to engage in a conversation 
     about bipartisan legislation to address them. They have 
     failed to provide necessary funding requested by the 
     Department of Homeland Security (DHS). They have failed to 
     provide resources for officers and agents at the border, 
     failed to fund the immigration judges necessary to handle the 
     influx of asylum claims, and failed to condemn the cruel and 
     deceptive acts of State and local Republicans who look to 
     score cheap political points by treating migrants as less 
     than human.
       To distract from this abject failure and appease the most 
     extreme elements of the Republican Conference, Republican 
     leadership launched a baseless impeachment investigation into 
     Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. This 
     impeachment is without precedent, without basis in the law, 
     and a total waste of time. Among its many fatal flaws, this 
     wholly partisan impeachment effort:
       Fails to articulate any charge that might constitute 
     ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''
       Fails to provide evidence to support the charges, such as 
     they are.
       Fails to name the proper target for impeachment in a policy 
     dispute with the executive branch, if indeed a policy dispute 
     is ever grounds for impeachment.
       Fails to provide due process to Secretary Mayorkas.
       Fails to address any of the real challenges at our Nation's 
     borders.
       Perhaps this shoddy effort is what Democrats should have 
     expected months ago, when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of 
     Georgia insisted to her leadership that ``[s]omebody needs to 
     be impeached,'' without specifying any particular target or 
     reason for the impeachment.


                       REPUBLICAN ABUSE OF POWER

       Instead of working to find commonsense, bipartisan 
     solutions to address immigration reform and border security--
     which are necessarily and inextricably intertwined--
     Republicans have, from the very earliest days of Secretary 
     Mayorkas' time in office, turned to character assassination. 
     Although their inability and unwillingness to enact new 
     policy is to blame, Republicans are angry that the Biden 
     administration has implemented its own border security and 
     immigration policies to enforce the law commensurate with the 
     resources provided by Congress. Secretary Mayorkas is 
     carrying out those policies, as is his duty.
       This report documents the failed basis for this sham 
     impeachment effort and provides the facts behind the Biden 
     administration's efforts to address the challenges at the 
     southern border in an orderly and humane way, consistent with 
     the law.

              CONGRATULATIONS PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as co-founder and co-chair 
of the European Union Caucus I am grateful for the European Union last 
week voting to provide an additional $54 billion in aid to Ukraine. The 
EU has now provided more aid than any other ally and countries like 
Bulgaria and Poland have contributed more per capita GDP than even the 
United States.
  I appreciate Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary supporting the 
funding. This fulfills my lifelong affection for the courageous people 
of Hungary. As a child I was inspired by Hungarian Freedom Fighters 
valiantly standing in front of the Soviet Tanks in Budapest. Hungary 
should always be cherished as the first Soviet satellite to stand up to 
totalitarian Moscow which was cited by Senator Barry Goldwater in his 
historic book Why Not Victory? for liberation of Central and Eastern 
Europe. The Goldwater Campaign featured actor Ronald Reagan in his 
historic speech ``A Tune For Choosing'' leading to his presidency with 
Pope John Paul, II, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher achieving 
Victory.
  Viktor Orban is valiantly acting in the tradition of Hungarian 
Freedom Fighters who defied the Communist Hammer and Sickle symbol of 
mass-murdering totalitarianism. War criminal Putin has shamefully 
oppressed the talented people of Russia and has shamefully called for 
the resurrection of the evil Soviet Empire. I was shocked in June this 
year, to see the Communist Hammer and Sickle is still cruelly in place 
over the Russian Embassy in Berlin, Germany. It was so disgusting to 
see adulation of a symbol that in September 1939 was allied with the 
Nazi Swastika to conduct mass murder of 70,000 Polish patriots in the 
partition of Poland.
  European Council President Charles Michel is correct ``This locks in 
steadfast, long term, predictable funding for Ukraine.'' It was 
encouraging the correlation with Prime Minister Orban with Italian 
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and French President Emmanuel Macron.
  In America there is bi-partisan majority support for Ukraine 
understanding war criminal Putin will not stop with his invasion of 
Ukraine with direct threats on NATO Members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
and Poland. President Donald Trump tried to deter the murderous 
invasion of Ukraine by providing Javelin missiles to President 
Volodymyr Zelensky to stop Putin tanks, courageously placing American 
troops for the first time in Poland and stopping the Nord Stream Two 
Pipeline financing of war criminal Putin oppressing Russian citizens as 
Putin contrived Western European dependency on his oil. House Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, and Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Mike Turner are stalwarts for victory in Ukraine. They are backed up 
with Democrat Ranking Members Adam Smith, Greg Meeks, and Jim Himes.

                HONORING THE LIFE OF RAMON SALINAS, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. TONY GONZALES

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
admirable life of Ramon Salinas, Jr., who unexpectedly passed away on 
February 1st of this year.
  Mr. Salinas dedicated his life to public service. In total, he served 
over twenty years in law enforcement--both as a Customs Officer for the 
Department of Treasury and as a Customs and Border Protection Officer 
under the Department of Homeland Security. Over the span of his 
distinguished career, Ramon set himself apart with his outstanding work 
ethic and will forever serve as a role model for those who follow in 
his footsteps.
  Mr. Salinas was also a beloved member of his community, and his 
dedication to serving others went far beyond his time in law 
enforcement. For many years, he was a devoted soccer coach and role 
model for the youth of Eagle Pass, Texas.
  Those who know Ramon Salinas, Jr. can speak to his patriotism, 
compassion, and devotion to faith. Though he will be dearly missed, Mr. 
Salinas' legacy will live on for years to come.
  He is survived by his wife Francelia, his daughter Evelyn, his son 
Ramon III, his granddaughter Elena Joy, his siblings, and many nieces 
and nephews.
  My condolences and prayers are with the Salinas family during this 
difficult time.

            BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING MIKE GARLAND

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a basketball 
coaching legend who

[[Page E123]]

helped lead the Michigan State University Spartans men's basketball 
team to 19 NCAA tournaments, 10 Big Ten Championships, seven Final 
Fours, and a National Championship. But as impressive as those 
statistics are, former MSU Assistant Coach Mike Garland quite literally 
came back from the dead and is now using his second chance at life to 
pay this incredible gift forward.
  As much as Mike Garland loved coaching basketball, and as many great 
things as his teams accomplished on the court, he was content with his 
decision to retire from MSU in June of 2022, and looking forward to 
spending more time with his wife, children, and grandchildren. Not long 
after, however, he went into cardiac arrest while driving his car. 
Fortunately two good Samaritans were driving by at the time, saw 
Garland's car go off the road and into a tree, called 911, and 
performed CPR until paramedics and police arrived. In total, 13 people 
worked on Garland for an agonizing 18 minutes to restart his heart.
  It turned out the electrical failure in Garland's heart was the 
result of a birth defect, one that required open heart surgery to fix. 
Three months later, Garland was back up and running- quite literally- 
on the treadmill. Not long after that he honored all those who helped 
save his life with an emotional public thank you at MSU's Breslin 
Center, home to many of his great coaching moments.
  Today, the Breslin Center is also home court for his new passion: a 
foundation he launched called Champions of the Heart. Through this non-
profit, Garland works to inform the Spartan community and others on how 
to save lives during episodes of cardiac arrest.
  Attendees at these free trainings learn how to perform CPR, how to 
recognize sudden cardiac arrest, and how to use an Automatic External 
Defibrillator.
  Mike Garland is a man who has lived two lives, both defined by 
statistics. In the first, his focus was on wins, losses, and free throw 
percentages. His second life, however, is summed up in a single stark 
numerical reality: only one person in ten survives a cardiac arrest. He 
has done much to defy the odds and change the course of history for 
himself and others.

       BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING ORRIN AND LUVINA WILSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to two of the most 
beloved residents to ever call the St. Johns, Michigan, community home: 
Orrin and Luvina Wilson. Settling in Clinton County post-Civil War, the 
Wilsons were a ``power couple'' before such a term existed, but it was 
never about seeking power for themselves. Rather, the Wilsons lived 
their lives in quiet but devoted and groundbreaking service to their 
nation and to their neighbors, and forever changed the face of St. 
Johns.
  Orrin was just 16 years old in 1864 when he enlisted in Michigan's 
all-Black regiment, the 102nd United States Colored Infantry. Company 
K, out of Kalamazoo. He served until the war's end, and returned to 
Michigan where he met and married his bride. The two would soon settle 
in St. Johns, where they lived out the next 60 years of their lives.
  In addition to his military service, Orrin was a trailblazer in so 
many ways. First. he took up the trade of barbering and owned his own 
shop for nearly 50 years, serving a mostly white clientele out of the 
old Steel Hotel in downtown St. Johns. He was also a founding member of 
the local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic, a national union 
of Civil War veterans, and served as its post commander for a time. Not 
only was he the only Black member of the St. Johns Charles Grisson Post 
of the GAR, it's believed he was the only Black man in the state to 
hold such a leadership position outside of the all-Black posts in 
cities like Detroit.
  Luvina was a trailblazer in her own right, serving as president of 
the local chapter of the Women's Relief Corps, the auxiliary 
organization to the Grand Army of the Republic. The WRC not only 
supported the mission to aid Union veterans, but also assisted former 
Army nurses and promoted patriotism through education. And just like 
her husband, Luvina is believed to be the only Black woman in the state 
to have led an all-white post.
  Orrin and Luvina raised two sons together: George and Arthur, who 
continued the family barbering trade. The family was active in the St. 
Johns United Methodist Church, where Orrin served as a trustee and 
treasurer for three decades. They were married for 58 years, and linked 
in their common goal of creating a better, more just community and 
nation. And united they also were in death, leaving this world just one 
day apart in late December of 1928. The two were buried together in the 
veterans' section of Mt. Rest Cemetery, with flags flown at half-mast 
and a large funeral procession going past the family home on South 
Clinton Avenue.
  May their life story and memory be a blessing and inspiration to all 
of us.

         HONORING INDEPENDENCE TOWNSHIP SUPERVISOR JOSE ALIAGA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Independence 
Township Supervisor Jose Aliaga. Mr. Aliaga, who embodies the American 
Dream, is an immigrant from Peru who faced many challenges coming to 
the United States including the biggest challenges of not knowing 
anyone or being able to speak English.
  After immigrating to the U.S., Jose attended the University of 
Michigan, where he earned his bachelor's degree in political science 
and a master's in social science. Moreover, Mr. Aliaga worked 
tirelessly to achieve a law degree from the Universidad Las Americas in 
Peru. After his time in school, Mr. Aliaga connected Latin American and 
U.S. companies and started his own business, Aliaga Development and 
Consulting, LLC. His work eventually earned him an invitation to the 
White House and recognition from the U.S. Congress.
  Mr. Aliaga is active in business and politics and, from time to time, 
he is known for engaging at universities in Peru. He has been featured 
on Fox News and Univision as a TV commentator. Mr. Aliaga treasures his 
local community where he partakes in local initiatives and committees. 
He is also a government reform activist, seeking a positive community 
impact.
  Independence Township has seen many positive changes since Mr. Aliaga 
took office, including refurbishing and revitalizing parks and 
implementing new standards for township employees. A new pilot program 
was recently established that extended township hall hours, making it 
more convenient for residents to pass through outside their standard 
work hours, yet another welcomed change for the community. Mr. Aliaga 
is also planning to rebrand the township to attract new businesses and 
residents to the area.
  Mr. Aliaga is an ambitious member of the Independence Township 
community. He is the Township Supervisor, but also sits on five other 
committees and boards in the township government. These include the 
Downtown Development Authority, the Television Video Center 
Administrative Board, Parks, Recreation & Seniors Advisory Committee, 
Safety Path Advisory Committee, and the Sashabaw Corridor Improvement 
Authority.
  Mr. Aliaga embodies public service. He works in his community for his 
community. His motto is ``I live to serve.'' It is an honor to 
recognize Jose Aliaga and all his accomplishments.

enjoyed playing football, basketball, baseball, golf, and bowling.
  Mr. Green was a devoted man of faith and regularly attended The Bay 
Church in Runaway Bay. He was a gifted craftsman, skillfully carving 
beautiful wooden birds by hand, and was also known for his landscaping 
prowess which helped keep his lawn pristine. He enjoyed spending time 
with his family, including his many grandchildren and great-
grandchildren.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's 
Capital in recognition of Mr. Green's wonderful and adventurous life. 
He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew him.

      RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PASTOR GREGORY CHRISTOPHER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEREK KILMER

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear 
friend Pastor Gregory Christopher and to recognize his decades of 
service to Tacoma's Shiloh Baptist Church and the greater Pierce County 
community.
  Pastor Christopher was called to the Ministry in 1989 and studied 
under the Pastoral leadership of Pastor Lonnie Brown at The Body of 
Christ Christian Church in Tacoma, Washington. He began his tenure with 
Shiloh Baptist Church in Tacoma's Hilltop neighborhood in 1993. where 
he is the Senior Pastor, and will be retiring this February 2024.
  In his 23 years on the pulpit, Pastor Christopher has created a 
legacy that puts him on hallowed ground. His dedication to his 
community and his faith places him in the same breath as the legendary 
Black faith leaders of Tacoma, including the late Rev. Earnest Brazill, 
who was Pastor Christopher's mentor at Shiloh Baptist Church. In 
addition to his congregational leadership, Pastor Christopher also 
serves on the Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, and is an At-Large Board 
Member of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.
  Pastor Christopher has been a fierce and tireless leader outside the 
Church as well. He is a compassionate advocate for folks experiencing 
homelessness, a champion for racial representation, and a catalyst for 
policy solutions to improve the lives of African Americans in Tacoma 
and throughout the greater Puget Sound region. His work has been 
demonstrated through his service as the President of the Tacoma branch 
of the NAACP, his membership in the Tacoma Pierce County Black 
Collective, and his past service on the board of the Tacoma Urban 
League.
  Pastor Christopher has been at the center of efforts to promote 
racial justice and religious social services for decades, working to 
boost inclusivity through expanding partnerships with marginalized 
communities within Pierce County. His leadership and his mission to 
empower the community have shaped our community for the better.
  Mr. Speaker, beyond detailing all his many accomplishments, I'd also 
like to express my gratitude for the partner that Pastor Christopher 
has been to my office and to me personally. I'm proud to call Pastor 
Christopher a friend and have appreciated his sage advice throughout my 
career. While we will miss him at Shiloh, I am happy that he will have 
more time with his family, including his wife, Evelyn, who also is a 
leader in the community, his children, grandchildren, and great 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Pastor Gregory Christopher in 
the United States Congress.

                          ____________________

          BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING THE CANADY FAMILY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a legendary Lansing 
family that has broken barriers across generations, and continues to 
make history today.
  The story begins in 1927 when the family matriarch, Ms. Hortense 
Canady was born in Chicago. While she didn't grow up in Michigan, she 
came to Michigan State University to pursue graduate studies after 
attending Fisk University, where she met her husband, Clinton. In the 
Lansing area, Hortense and Clinton, a World War II veteran and member 
of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, settled, put down roots, and left an 
indelible mark on the community.
  Clinton became a well-known and well-loved dentist, while Hortense 
put her passion for education and civil rights into action, becoming 
the first African American elected to the Lansing School District Board 
of Education in 1968. Four years later, she and several other board 
members were recalled for advocating for desegregation, but Hortense 
did not let that deter her from working toward her core belief that 
everyone deserves access to quality education.
  She sat on the state's Women's Commission, served as the first 
executive director of the Lansing Community College Foundation, and 
helped found a debutante club in Lansing to fill in a void for young 
Black women who, at the time, were not permitted to share in this 
tradition.
  Hortense founded the Lansing alumnae chapter of her sorority, Delta 
Sigma Theta, and served as its national president from 1983 to 1988. 
She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2002 and was 
named as one of Ebony magazine's Most Influential People. Hortense 
Canady died in 2010 at age 83.
  Not only was Hortense Canady impressive in her own right, but her 
children have continued to blaze their own trails. Her daughter, Alexa 
Canady, is the first African American woman in the nation to become a 
neurosurgeon, and served as chief of neurosurgery at the Children's 
Hospital of Michigan from 1987 until her retirement in June 2001. She 
devoted her brilliant mind and her numerous talents to the healing and 
welfare of thousands of young patients over the course of her career, 
and, like her mother, is an inductee in the Michigan Women's Hall of 
Fame. She was also named a Michigander of the Year by the Detroit News 
in 2002.
  All three of Hortense Canady's sons became attorneys, including the 
Honorable Judge Clinton Canady III. Before ascending to the bench, 
Canady practiced law for 37 years. He was a founder of the Lansing 
Black Lawyers' Association, director of the Ingham County Bar 
Association, a commissioner for the Lansing Board of Water and Light, a 
member of the NAACP, and served on the board of the Lansing Symphony 
Association, Central Michigan Legal Aid, and many other organizations. 
Elected to the Ingham County Circuit Court in 2010, Judge Canady served 
through his retirement in 2022, but returned on assignment to help 
address the backlog of cases from the pandemic.
  He and his wife, Rita, have two children who are continuing the 
Canady tradition of service, one as an administrative law judge in 
California, and the other with the United States Department of State.
  The Canady family is part of the very fabric of the Lansing 
community, a fabric stitched with their incredible work ethic, 
commitment to breaking new ground, and to clearing a path for others to 
follow.

 HONORING THE BERKOSKI FAMILY'S SUCCESS AT THE 108TH PENNSYLVANIA FARM 
                                  SHOW

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Debra 
Martin Berkoski and her husband, Steven Berkoski, for their combined 
successes at the 108th Pennsylvania Farm Show.
  The week contains a multitude of meanings for her, including her 
birthday. Debra began attending the Farm Show at 10 years old, showing 
sheep. This year, as she turned 57 years old, she and Steven won a 
combined 89 ribbons out of the 100 competitions they entered, 22 of 
them being first place prizes.
  Most notably, Debra took home first prize in Pennsylvania's Greatest 
Whoopie Pie contest with her pumpkin whoopie pie. Anyone from our 
Commonwealth knows that whoopies pies are essential desserts at any 
Pennsylvanian event.
  Throughout the week, the Berkoskis commuted over 500 miles between 
the Harrisburg Expo Center and their home. In order to

[[Page E125]]

produce all of their entries, they used a total of 360 eggs, 60 pounds 
of sugar, 55 pounds of flour, and 25 pounds of butter.
  Mr. Speaker, it is the dedication of people like the Berkoskis that 
honor Pennsylvania's rich agricultural traditions. In addition to being 
active participants in the Farm Show, the Berkoskis operate a 200-year-
old family farm in Conestoga.
  I want to congratulate the Berkoskis on their success at this year's 
Farm Show and thank them for their tireless dedication to honoring our 
community's rich agricultural heritage and sharing their skills and 
passion with the thousands of individuals who attend the Farm Show each 
year.

     REMEMBERING THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF AZERBAIJAN'S BLACK JANUARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL A. GOSAR

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 34th 
anniversary of Azerbaijan's Black January, During this horrific January 
1990 event. Soviet troops marched into Baku, Azerbaijan to suppress the 
freedom and the sovereignty of the Azeri people. This condemnable 
action by the Soviet Union during Black January contributed to the 
deaths of 147 civilians and the injuring of 744 more.
  The desires of the Azeri people were fair and reasonable, but to 
Soviet ]eaders, these desires were unacceptable and had to be crushed. 
Despite the savage Soviet opposition on Black January, the Azeri people 
remained steadfast in their strong dedication to freedom and self-
determination. This dedication contributed to Azerbaijan ultimately 
gaining its independence in 1991.
  Black January is a striking reminder of communism's horrors. The 
death and despair caused by the Soviet Union is shocking example of 
this destructive ideology's violent response to dissent and free 
thought. Such a reminder is important not only for America, but the 
whole world. We can never let the odious forces of communism prevail 
against the honorable ideals of liberty and individualism.
  Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan is a key ally of the United States, 
Azerbaijan's economic and security partnership advances American 
interests in Eurasia. It is in the best interest of the United States 
and Azerbaijan to maintain close bilateral ties with each other. 
Because of this, I hope the friendship between our two countries will 
flourish for years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in somber remembrance of 
Black January and the lives tragically lost during this saddening 
event. I also urge my colleagues to join me in strong condemnation of 
the evils of communism, as well as in recognition of the stalwart 
friendship between the United States and the Republic of Azerbaijan.

                         POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. BARBARA LEE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to address the ongoing 
challenges that too many families in America face coping with poverty 
and income inequality. I thank my dear friend, Congressman DeSaulnier, 
for hosing this Special Order hour, and for his tireless work on these 
issues.
  In the richest country in the world, poverty is a policy choice. In 
early 2023, the poverty rate in California rose to 13.2 percent, and 
the child poverty rate to 13.8 percent.
  You cannot disentangle poverty and inequality from systemic racism. 
Latinos remained disproportionately poor. Latinos comprise about half 
of poor Californians, but only around 40 percent of all Californians. 
Additionally, about 13.6 percent of African Americans and 11.5 percent 
of Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders lived in poverty in California at 
the beginning of 2023 compared to 10.2 percent of white residents. That 
is why I reintroduced legislation calling for the establishment of the 
first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation. 
This Commission will examine the effects of slavery, institutional 
racism, and discrimination against people of color, and how our history 
impacts laws and policies today.
  But while poverty has a disproportionate impact on people of color, 
poverty afflicts millions of people in America of all racial and ethnic 
backgrounds. That is why I have worked with the Poor People's Campaign 
to introduce a resolution calling for a Third Reconstruction to fully 
address poverty from the bottom up. A Third Reconstruction would 
prioritize the needs and demands of the 140 million people in America 
who are poor or one emergency away from economic desperation, with 
policies focused on healthcare, welfare, water, public education, and 
housing.
  Across the country, rents and home prices continue to rise much 
faster than income, exacerbating housing instability during an 
affordable housing supply crisis. A staggering 78 percent of extremely 
low income renters in California are severely cost burdened. meaning 
they spend more than half of their income on housing and utilities. 
This is unacceptable when we have the power and tools to eliminate 
poverty entirely.
  Access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of income, is a 
human right. I am proud to sponsor the DEPOSIT Act, which would provide 
security deposit assistance to low-income renters.
  As Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Poverty Task Force. I won't 
stop fighting until we pass comprehensive legislation to eradicate 
poverty, economic inequality, and racial injustice. There is a strong 
correlation between U.S. poverty reduction initiatives and declining 
poverty rates. We must work to ensure that the Child Tax Credit is 
restored to American Rescue Plan levels, which cut child poverty in 
half.
  We must ensure the House remains focused on combating poverty in all 
forms and creating economic opportunity for all Americans. Together, we 
can work to reduce disparities and secure justice for those struggling 
to put food on the table.

       BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING REV. LILLIAN ARCHIBALD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a woman who defied not only 
the odds but her own family's wishes to become a pioneer in the pulpit 
at a landmark Black church in Livingston County, Michigan.
  Though her father was a devout Baptist preacher in the early part of 
the 20th century, Lillian Archibald was taught from a young age that 
ministry was strictly for men. The fourth of five children, Lillian's 
father was clear in his message to his daughters: love the Lord, but 
find another calling for work.
  Skeptical but obedient, Lillian attended a business college in her 
hometown of Memphis and spent time as a missionary before starting a 
family of her own. Tragically, the youngest of her four children was 
killed in 1977 in a crash between a car and a train. Despite her 
profound grief, Lillian took solace in her unshakeable faith, and made 
the decision that it was time to answer the call that had been placed 
upon her heart.
  Lillian enrolled at Payne Theological Seminary, and entered the 
ministry at age 50. She spent some time as an itinerant elder before 
being ordained as a full minister in 1985. And of course, she broke the 
news to her father, who she says grew quiet before finally giving her 
his blessing.
  She brought that blessing to Michigan, first serving six years 
assisting the pastor at a church in Jackson, before being assigned to 
pastor St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church in Brighton--the 
only African American church in predominantly white Livingston County--
in 1990.
  With her melodic voice and charismatic style, Reverend Archibald is 
credited with breathing new life and hope into the congregation, where 
she stayed for four years. During her tenure, the church grew in size 
and in spirit, and began reaching out to the community and joining with 
other churches with a sense of common purpose and passion.
  Though her time in Livingston County was brief, her impact was 
profound. She received numerous recognitions for her commitment to the 
community, including her work with victims of domestic violence at the 
Women's Resource Center in Howell, and her efforts to shelter the 
unhoused through Habitat for Humanity.
  Perhaps one of her greatest gifts was the mentorship she offered to 
other women contemplating the call to ministry. Reverend Archibald is 
still warmly remembered today by many of them as a compassionate guide 
and a listening ear. Her courageous ministry and her golden voice still 
guide the work of St. James AME Church.

     BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING DR. SAMUEL EDWARD HOLLOWAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor a man who was a trailblazer 
in athletics and

[[Page E126]]

education, and used his talents to break barriers and change the lives 
of generations of young people. Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway lived to 
serve others: his nation, his community, and his family. It is fitting 
that as we mark Black History Month, we shine a light on his place in 
the history of Michigan's 7th District and the many doors he opened for 
others to pass through.
  But before he was Dr. Holloway, he was simply ``Sam,'' a young man 
who came to Michigan with his father, who had left the deep South as 
part of the Great Migration. After spending his childhood in various 
parts of the Midwest, Sam and his family settled in Michigan in the 
1940s, where he would eventually join the Ann Arbor High School class 
of 1951. Sam's athletic abilities were evident from a young age, as he 
was crowned state champion in his wrestling class during his high 
school years. Also clear was his desire to use his life for the greater 
good, as he enlisted in the United States Army upon graduation, and was 
honorably discharged in 1953.
  It was then that Sam began embarking on what would become his life's 
calling: public education. He received his Bachelor's and Master's 
degrees from Eastern Michigan University, during which time he also 
began his teaching career. And so it was, at the height of the civil 
rights movement in 1963, when Samuel Edward Holloway became the first 
Black faculty member in the history of South Lyon Public Schools. 
During his tenure there, he is also credited with becoming the first 
Black person to serve as head wrestling coach for a high school team in 
the state of Michigan.
  Eventually Holloway earned his PhD in education, and went on to serve 
in numerous districts, including Ypsilanti Public Schools and Romulus 
Public Schools. In the late 1970s he became a building administrator at 
Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, a full circle moment for the man who 
had graduated from that very district. He held that post until his 
retirement in 1990, a retirement that he and his wife Janet enjoyed to 
the fullest. Still an athlete at heart and in practice, Holloway 
competed each year in the Arizona Senior Olympics, and rode his 
motorcycle across the United States and Europe.
  Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway passed away in 2022, leaving behind his 
devoted wife, his four children, a large and loving extended family, 
and an incredible legacy. Dr. Holloway didn't set out to be a pioneer; 
he simply wanted to do the things he loved in the service of others. I 
now ask that the People's House reflect his groundbreaking 
contributions and the gratitude of the institutions forever changed by 
his presence.

                         HONORING CINDY MACHADO

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cindy 
Machado upon her retirement from the Marin Humane Society (Marin 
Humane) after 40 years of extraordinary public service.
  A longtime Northern California resident, Cindy has been fighting for 
the rights and welfare of animals with Marin Humane since 1984. At that 
time, the animal service officer role was dominated by men, but Cindy's 
knowledge of animal science, equines and livestock made her an 
effective enforcer of animal control and cruelty laws. She was quickly 
promoted to Field Services Sergeant in 1985 and assumed the role of 
Animal Services Director in 1996, a position she held until her 
retirement.
  Cindy's impeccable leadership was critical to establishing Marin 
Humane as a highly respected organization locally, and at the regional, 
national, and international levels. She was instrumental in creating 
the Animal Law Enforcement Academy, a program hosted by Marin Humane 
through Santa Rosa Junior College, in partnership with the California 
Animal Welfare Association (Cal Animals). She also served the Academy 
as an instructor on issues including animal cruelty investigations, 
animal hoarding, and inspections, and managed an annual Advanced 
Academy program for almost two decades.
  From pet shops and cock fighting rings to circuses and amusement 
parks, Cindy has worked tirelessly to end animal cruelty. She has led 
investigations, testified in court, and participated in many 
legislative hearings. Her influence has been far reaching as an 
advocate and educator, leading trainings and workshops on behalf of 
Marin Humane across the world, including at the Brazilian Animal 
Welfare Congress in 2000, in Taiwan with the Humane Society of the 
United States in 2001, and in Mexico with Compassion Without Borders in 
2005.
  Cindy has also been an animal advocate in preparation and response to 
natural disasters. She co-founded the Marin Horse Council's Equine 
Evacuation Committee in 2006, represented Marin Humane with Marin's 
Emergency Operations Center since 1996, and spearheaded a Marin County 
Veterinary Medical Association and Marin Humane joint committee to 
educate the community on impacts on animals. When a disaster hit, Cindy 
was always quick to act. She deployed to Houston during Hurricane 
Katrina to assist with animal evacuations, the 2009 Cosco Busan oil 
spill in San Francisco Bay, and nearly every wildfire in the region.
  Among her numerous commitments, Cindy is a member and former chair of 
the Marin Humane Advocacy Committee, member and trainer of the 
CalAnimals Training Committee, Advisory Member of the Big Cat Sanctuary 
Alliance, and co-founder of the Marin County Hoarding Alliance 
Taskforce. Cindy was also pivotal in creating a non-lethal predator 
control model in collaboration with Marin's Agricultural Commission and 
Project Coyote, which remains in use today.
  Mr. Speaker, I have personally witnessed Cindy in action and can 
attest to her knowledge, skills, and commitment to animal welfare. As 
Cindy Machado retires after 40 years of service, she leaves an 
indelible legacy of good deeds for animals in Marin County and the 
extended region. I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
heartfelt gratitude to Cindy for her generosity of spirit, innumerable

           HONORING MR. HOWARD MAUTNER ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KAT CAMMACK

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's Third Congressional 
District, we wish Mr. Howard Alan Mautner a very happy 100th birthday.
  Howard was born in Rockford, Illinois, on April 28, 1924. When Howard 
was eight years old, his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin. He lived 
there until he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in October 1942 at 
age 18.
  Howard was inducted into the military at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, and 
went to recruit training at what is now known as Keesler Air Force Base 
in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was then assigned to radio school in what is 
now Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois. He learned Morse code 
and radio training. After schooling, he served several months at 
Marshall Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Riley, Kansas. He then 
reported into an overseas duty staging area at Seymour Johnson Air 
Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina. In September 1943, Howard 
headed to Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, where he boarded a Liberty ship 
for the port of Casablanca (Morocco).
  Howard served in Naples, Italy between September 1943 and December 
1944 before heading onto Venice, Italy from December 1944 to May 1945. 
By August 1945, the war was over, but Howard was sent to Vienna, 
Austria, as part of the occupational force. Howard was especially 
grateful to have visited Vienna, as that was his father's birthplace in 
the late 1880s. In December 1945, he was transported back to America 
aboard the USS Randolph, landing at Fort Dix in New Jersey, where he 
was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant.
  For the last several decades, Howard has lived in Ocala, Florida, and 
has been a treasured member of the Marion County veterans' community. 
We are honored to wish him a happy 100th birthday and to thank him for 
his dutiful service to our Nation. Congratulations to Howard on this 
milestone. We are elated to celebrate with him.

                          ____________________

            BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING XAVIER DAVIS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to shine a light on the 
incredible accomplishments of a member of the Michigan State University 
jazz community: Associate Professor of Jazz Piano, Xavier Davis.
  It was 1994 and Xavier Davis, then a college student from Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, was performing with a small ensemble at a convention 
in Boston when his tunes caught the ear of the legendary jazz vocalist 
Betty Carter, a native of Flint. Carter scooped him up and brought him 
to New York, hiring him to work exclusively as the pianist for her jazz 
trio.
  Davis spent many years in New York, cultivating his talent, learning 
from and playing with some of the greatest names in jazz, including 
Carl Allen, James Williams, Billy Hart,

[[Page E127]]

Regina Carter, and Wynton Marsalis. He served as musical director for 
the Boy's Choir of Harlem during its 1999-2000 season, played keyboard 
for the television series ``Cosby,'' and has been featured on more than 
50 albums, including a Grammy-winning collaboration with Christian 
McBride in 2012.
  We're so fortunate that after six years of teaching at the famed 
Juilliard School, Davis brought his talents back home and has been 
teaching jazz piano at Michigan State University since 2014.
  In addition to the many students who have benefited from his 
instruction, Davis has also dedicated himself to uplifting his adopted 
hometown of Detroit through his music.
  Supported by a grant from Michigan State University's Humanities and 
Arts Research Program, Davis began composing music about Detroit, which 
eventually became a powerful album titled ``Rise Up Detroit.'' Through 
his music, Davis focuses on the role Detroit has played on the lives of 
African-Americans and on the world at large, highlighting the 
Underground Railroad, the Great Migration, and the boom days of the 
auto industry.
  Professor Davis is a gifted composer, arranger, and producer of 
music, and widely recognized as one of the most accomplished jazz 
pianists in the world. He is also a proud Michigander, continually 
giving back to the community and the state that put the music in his 
soul.
  While he is the recording artist, it is my distinct pleasure to 
record his accomplishments and convey my gratitude for his 
contributions here.

           BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING RODNEY WHITAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a member of the 
Michigan State University faculty who has contributed to the rich 
artistic landscape of our great state and helped shape the next 
generation of musical talents, all set to a distinctive jazz beat.
  As a young recording artist in Detroit, Rodney Whitaker likely never 
imagined he would one day build and lead one of the most distinguished 
jazz degree programs and performing faculties in the world. But the 
legendary bassist, known for his distinctive ``bear-sized'' tones, 
today serves as Director of Jazz Studies at MSU, a program he has 
transformed into a world class training ground whose students have gone 
on to perform alongside some of the top jazz artists in the world.
  It's a case of those who CAN do, teach, as Whitaker himself spent 
seven years as bassist with Wynton Marsalis' Septet and the Lincoln 
Center Jazz Orchestra, followed by a quarter-century touring around the 
world, collaborating and performing with ]egendary jazz artists from 
Dizzy Gillespie to Diana Krall. And he continues to teach master 
classes at universities around the world, all while serving as artistic 
director of the Michigan State University Professors of Jazz, the East 
Lansing Summer Solstice Jazz Festival, the Dr. Phillips Center Jazz 
Orchestra in Orlando, Florida, and the Gathering Orchestra in Detroit, 
to name a few of his many involvements.
  He has earned one of the highest distinctions in academia, the title 
of University Distinguished Professor, and he is proud to serve as a 
special assistant to the dean's office, directing the College of 
Music's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging efforts. In 2006, he 
was nominated for the Juno Award, Canada's equivalent to the Grammy, 
and in 2011, he received an Emmy nomination. Just last year he was 
named 2023 Detroit Jazz Hero by the Jazz Journalists Association.
  But strip away all the titles, all the awards, and Whitaker is simply 
a man who understands the power of the gift he has been given, and the 
necessity to pass it on. In his own words, Dr. Rodney Whitaker said, 
quote:
  ``That is my truth. I love passing on the knowledge of the history of 
music, and it's life-changing to see that lightbulb go off in someone. 
It certainly changed my life.''
  For all the lives he has enriched, changed, and set to music, I ask 
that his contributions forever be remembered.

                          ____________________

                          HONORING JIM KENNEDY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MARK DeSAULNIER

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of 
Jim Kennedy as we celebrate the dedication of the Jim Kennedy Village 
Green at the Contra Costa Centre--Pleasant Hill BART Transit Village.
  Jim was born in Montana and grew up in North Dakota before moving to 
Davis, CA in the 1960s. He received his bachelor's and a master's 
degree in Economics/Environmental Economics from San Diego State 
University. Jim served as Contra Costa County's Redevelopment Director 
for 35 years where he spearheaded efforts to improve traffic congestion 
and quality of life throughout the region until his retirement in 2011.
  Jim has worked tirelessly to implement transit-oriented development 
at the Pleasant Hill BART Station Area. Jim led efforts to develop 
office spaces, high density residential spaces, and initiate 
improvements to greenspaces and trails. This effort supports many 
quality jobs and features affordable housing units and convenient 
retail shops along the 680 Corridor. The high-quality housing in 
proximity to recreation and transit also attracts workers from San 
Francisco and other job centers along the BART line. Jim played a vital 
role in overseeing this project and helping to achieve this goal.
  Jim is an active member of the community, having formerly served as 
President, Executive Director, and Board Member of the California 
Redevelopment Association. He also served on the board of the Kennedy-
King Memorial Scholarship Fund from 1987 to 2023 and currently serves 
on the Eden Housing Board of Directors (2013-Present). He is also a 
founding Co-Executive Director of the Pleasant Hill BART Leasing 
Authority.
  The Village Green--the connection between the Iron Horse Trail and 
the Town Square/Fare gates of the BART station--will be named the ``Jim 
Kennedy Village Green'' in honor of Jim's critical work. This is a 
fitting tribute to his vision and hard work.
  Please join me in recognizing Jim for his many contributions to our 
community and devoted service to Contra Costa County.

                  WATER CRISIS TORMENTING SOUTH TEXAS

  (Ms. DE LA CRUZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. DE LA CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an urgent 
matter, the water crisis tormenting south Texas farmers and residents.
  Our communities, bound by the Rio Grande, suffer as the Mexican 
Government delays the treaty-mandated water deliveries. This isn't 
merely an inconvenience. It is a threat to our livelihood and is a 
national food security issue.
  As planting season looms, our farmers face halved yields. Without 
immediate action, the ripple effects will be felt nationwide, meaning 
less produce on the shelves, soaring food prices, and heightened 
foreign dependence.
  The House has already passed my bipartisan House resolution urging 
the Mexican Government to provide consistent, annual water deliveries 
as per our 1944 treaty. I ask the Biden administration to firmly 
advocate on behalf of our farmers and secure a reliable water future.

  Hear us, O Lord, and answer us. Hear the prayers of the hostages in

loss of their loved ones.
  Hear our prayers, Lord. Listen to our cries for mercy for the 
countless men and women, wherever they find themselves, who call to You 
this day in distress. Answer them. For You, Lord, are a compassionate 
and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in love and faithfulness.
  Turn to Your people throughout the world whose relentless foes attack 
them from all sides. Condemn the ruthless people whose weapons are 
torment and injustice, whose only goals are pain and death.
  Turn to all those who are broken by misery and overwhelmed by fear 
wherever they find themselves this day and have mercy on them. Show 
Your strength on behalf of those who call upon Your name, who cling 
with faith to the promise of Your salvation.
  Give them a sign of Your goodness that their enemies may see it and 
be put to shame.
  In You alone do they find help and hope and comfort. Hear us, O Lord, 
and answer us, for we pray in Your sovereign name.
  Amen.

                      ABORTION CARE IS HEALTHCARE

  (Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last month marked 51 years 
since Roe v. Wade was decided, holding a women's fundamental right to 
privacy in their medical decisions. Women had the right to abortion 
because abortion care is healthcare.
  Legal abortions have saved countless women's lives. Yet, after 
rightwing extremists spent 50 years pushing misinformation on abortion, 
our Supreme Court did their bidding and stripped away the rights and 
freedoms of women nationwide.
  The far-right Court claimed the Dobbs decision would simply send the 
choice back to the States. Instead, it sent our Nation into chaos--
doctors unsure if they can help their patients, assault survivors 
unsure if they can go to the police, and women crossing State lines to 
save their own lives.
  Like many of you, I am exhausted by politicians who claim to support 
women, support life, and then work to strip away access to 
contraception, fertility care, and gynecological health.
  I am exhausted by the fact that my daughters-in-law and 
granddaughters

[[Page H508]]

have fewer rights than I did. I am exhausted that Roe is gone.
  Yet, we must not tire. No matter how long the fight, whether in this 
Congress or the next, we must restore a woman's right to legal 
abortion.

         RECOGNIZING 114TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is the 114th 
anniversary of the Boys Scouts of America, the Nation's foremost youth 
program of character development and values-based leadership training.
  On February 8, 1910, Chicago businessman William D. Boyce, who grew 
up in western Pennsylvania, incorporated the Boy Scouts of America. It 
later went on to be chartered by the U.S. Congress.
  Since then, millions of young men and women have joined the Scouts 
and learned the values of patriotism, courage, and self-reliance.
  I have been involved in Scouting for more than 50 years, including 
serving as a Scoutmaster and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout in 1977. 
Scouting helped me discover my life purpose: helping others.
  I take the lessons learned throughout my own Scouting career and 
apply them in every aspect of my life today, including in my job as a 
U.S. Congressman.
  As co-chair of the Congressional Scouting Caucus, I am proud to 
introduce a resolution, alongside my fellow Eagle Scout from Georgia 
(Mr. Bishop), designating tomorrow, February 8, as Boy Scouts of 
America Day, to honor the tireless service of Scout volunteers and 
participants in our communities.
  In challenging times like now, I think we could all learn a lesson 
from the Scout slogan: ``Do a Good Turn Daily.''

                       RECOGNIZING AMIRAM COOPER

  (Ms. BALINT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to share the story of 
Amiram Cooper.
  Amiram is 85, a husband, a father, a grandfather of nine, a composer, 
and a poet. His love for the arts and writing inspires everyone around 
him.
  On October 7, he was 1 of more than 240 men, women, children, and 
elderly who were kidnapped by Hamas.
  Amiram was one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the sites of 
this horrible attack. This tight-knit community was left devastated by 
the brutality of that day.
  Amiram and 135 others are still held captive in Gaza today. Their 
families continue to live a nightmare--devastated, not knowing what 
conditions their loved ones are in. It has been 123 days.
  We must demand that medical and aid organizations be able to treat 
the hostages and negotiate on their behalf.
  We must continue to do everything in our power to keep these hostages 
and their families in our hearts and to keep telling their stories.
  We must bring every single hostage home and end this violence.

           CELEBRATING 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF CALVO'S INSURANCE

  (Mr. MOYLAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 85th 
anniversary of Calvo's Insurance, a company that has been a pillar of 
support for thousands in my island community.
  In 1938, Eduardo T. Calvo began selling fire and typhoon insurance 
out of his home. What began as a small part-time job has grown into the 
largest and oldest insurance provider on Guam.
  This success is a true testament to Calvo's Insurance's unwavering 
commitment to serving the people of Guam. Their ability to provide 
comprehensive and affordable insurance has significantly benefited our 
community, and their growth over the decades has infused Guam's economy 
while creating new jobs.
  As they celebrate this momentous occasion, I want to wish Calvo's 
Insurance continued success and prosperity in the years to come. May 
they continue to serve as a shining example of excellence in the 
insurance industry.

 RECOGNIZING MICHELLE O'NEILL'S ELECTION AS FIRST MINISTER OF NORTHERN 
                                IRELAND

  (Mr. NEAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Michelle O'Neill 
on her election to serve as First Minister of Northern Ireland, the 
first Irish nationalist leader in history to hold the seat, and also 
for the tone she set by pledging to be a leader for all the people of 
Northern Ireland.
  After 2 years of delays and two successive elections in which the 
people made their voices heard, parties will once again sit in 
government and resume the difficult work of legislating.
  The democratic institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement 
have been critical in sustaining peace and prosperity on the island of 
Ireland. As a guarantor of that agreement, the United States has the 
indispensable role of continuing to uphold these principles of self-
government, ensuring that progress made over the last years will 
continue into the future.
  I have no doubt that the people of Ireland should be proud of these 
institutions, and I look forward to the realization of renewed 
stability with the return of a power-sharing government.

                        PREPARE NOW FOR ATTACKS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago, I issued a 
heartfelt warning for all families in America. This is bipartisan in 
that the terrorists consider all Americans as targets.
  I had been excusing the irresponsible open borders as recruiting 
millions of low-information voters to perpetuate Democrat elitist 
power. Sadly, well-respected Members of Congress, last weekend, 
clarified open borders is purposeful insanity, putting American 
families at risk everywhere of murderous attacks.
  With terrorists and millions of illegal aliens, more 9/11 attacks 
will lead to growth of government for elitist power. The ``ends 
justifies the means'' concentrates power in their worship of government 
run by elitists.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge that all American families, having full gas 
tanks, should prepare now with an attack rally point when 
communications are cut. Families should have a pre-chosen refuge of 
safety to face the terrorists that are facing our country.
  Most at risk of mass murder and starvation are the homebound and 
disabled elderly. There should be plans for their recovery.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, who have protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues moving from the 
Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders for 
terrorists. It is sadly clear that there will be more 9/11 attacks 
across America, as the FBI has indicated.

                   CONDEMNING BIDEN'S ENERGY POLICIES

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn Biden's 
disastrous energy policies that have hurt consumers with skyrocketing 
costs and jeopardized national security.
  On day one, he launched a war on American energy by killing the 
Keystone pipeline. Most recently, he announced a pause on all pending 
natural gas permits and that he would no longer hold court-ordered 
offshore gas lease sales. These shortsighted decisions embolden 
adversaries in their aggression toward American allies who rely on U.S. 
energy.
  Mr. Speaker, we must support commonsense measures, like those 
contained in the Lower Energy Costs Act, to restore American energy 
dominance,

[[Page H509]]

lower costs for consumers, and protect our national security.

          PROTECTING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS ACT OF 2023


                             General Leave

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 
485.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 996 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 485.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) to 
preside over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  0915


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 485) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to prohibit the 
use of quality-adjusted life years and similar measures in coverage and 
payment determinations under Federal health care programs, with Mr. 
Meuser in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and amendments specified 
in this section and shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce or their respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers) and the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.
  The chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 485, my Protecting 
Health Care for All Patients Act, which affirms every person's life has 
value by banning the use of quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs, and 
similar discriminatory measures from all Federal healthcare programs.
  As many of you know, my son Cole was born with an extra 21st 
chromosome. Most of you know it as Down syndrome.
  When Cole was born, the doctors gave us a long list of challenges and 
chances for heartache. It was difficult, but I could have never 
imagined just how positively he would impact my life, my family's life, 
and the world.
  Today, Cole is a fun-loving 16-year-old with big dreams. He wants to 
be a football player, a pastor, and a race car driver. He is on the 
basketball team. He plays the drums. For Cole, the sky is the limit.
  Cole and others with disabilities deserve every opportunity to 
succeed. We shouldn't be discounting their potential or prejudging the 
quality of their life just because of their disabilities.
  Unfortunately, several tools frequently used in our healthcare system 
do just that. QALYs, and other similar discriminatory measures, assign 
a dollar value on the life of a patient to decide if a certain 
treatment is cost effective, oftentimes discounting an individual's 
worth and the need for care solely because of their disability or 
chronic illness.
  It means a bureaucracy coldly determines the value of someone's life 
and could deny necessary healthcare due to that calculation.
  Measurements like QALYs remove the consideration of unique 
circumstances and health conditions of a patient and their doctor's 
judgment from deciding what is best for the patient.
  I am not alone in opposing the use of these measures.
  Democrats acknowledged this when they passed the Affordable Care Act, 
and they banned the use of QALYs in Medicare.
  In 2020, the Democratic National Committee platform stated that: 
``Democrats will ensure that people with disabilities are never denied 
coverage based on the use of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
indexes.''
  The nonpartisan National Council on Disabilities wrote a report in 
2019 titled: ``Quality-Adjusted Life Years and the Devaluation of Life 
with a Disability'' that condemned the usage of QALYs and they have 
continued to write additional letters to Congress urging us to ban 
their use.
  Additionally, we have heard from nearly 200 advocacy groups spanning 
the political spectrum who are calling on Congress to prohibit the use 
of QALYs and other discriminatory measures.
  This legislation, the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, 
bans Federal payers, like Medicaid and VA healthcare, from using QALYs 
or other discriminatory measures that devalue the lives of people with 
disabilities and chronic or rare diseases, and it does it by simply 
applying the current ban on QALYs and other similar measures that exist 
in Medicare today to all Federal payers.
  In passing this bill, it will mean that healthcare bureaucracies can 
no longer discriminate against the weakest and most vulnerable 
patients, and it will help ensure that people can get the healthcare 
that they need and that their doctors think is best.
  This would be a big deal.
  Medicaid is the largest payer for people with disabilities, and we 
are letting it use measures that discriminate against the very people 
it was designed to support.
  That is nothing to say of the millions of injured or disabled 
veterans who rely on the VA for their healthcare, which is also allowed 
to use these types of measures.
  However, let me be clear in this: H.R. 485 does not prohibit 
healthcare programs from rewarding value or finding other ways to hold 
down costs.

  For example, if a treatment does not work or shouldn't be covered or 
it is more appropriate to start with other more cost-effective 
treatments first, nothing in this bill will preclude the Federal payers 
from continuing to make these kinds of coverage decisions.
  In fact, the National Council on Disability has already identified 
alternative ways to measure value that do not devalue the life of 
someone with a disability or chronic illness.
  Because of Cole, I have spent my time in Congress as an ability 
advocate, encouraging people to focus on every individual's God-given 
talent and potential.
  Millions of Americans like Cole need their voices to be heard. 
Whenever I meet someone with a disability or chronic illness, or with 
their family, I hear the same thing over and over: They want the same 
chances to succeed in life as everyone else.
  You know what? We are all just one car accident or one diagnosis away 
from having a disability ourselves.
  I hope that banning the use of discriminatory measures by Federal 
payers against people with disabilities and chronic illness and 
affirming every person's life has value is something that we can agree 
on. Let's give people with disabilities, rare diseases, or chronic 
diseases hope.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this important legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 485, 
the so-called Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, a bill that, 
unfortunately, does not live up to its name.
  This legislation is not about protecting healthcare for patients. 
Instead, it is a Trojan horse intended to undermine the progress that 
President Biden and Democrats have made in lowering prescription drug 
costs for American families.
  My Republican colleagues say this bill is intended to prevent the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services from using a measure called 
``quality-adjusted life years,'' or QALYs, which could be 
discriminatory against Americans living with disabilities, but Federal 
law, including the Inflation Reduction Act, already prohibits Medicare 
from using QALYs in its coverage determination, and State Medicaid 
programs are required by law to cover all drugs.

[[Page H510]]

  Instead, H.R. 485 goes further than current law and opens a back door 
that will be used to bar the use of any value measures by the Federal 
Government. These measures are used by Federal agencies such as the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, and by States to negotiate fair prices for prescription drugs.
  When this bill came before the Energy and Commerce Committee, I 
sought to clarify its intent through an amendment during markup. My 
amendment would have ensured the legislation could not be construed to 
undermine Federal agencies or the Biden administration's ongoing work 
to lower prescription drug prices for Americans, but that amendment was 
rejected on a party-line vote.
  I still do not understand why the Republican majority would be 
opposed to clarifying that the bill before us today is not intended to 
undermine the Federal Government's efforts to determine fair prices for 
prescription drugs.
  Now, I respect the chairman of our committee a great deal, but she 
keeps talking about how she is banning similar discriminatory measures. 
Well, the fact of the matter is that the bill doesn't say ``similar 
discriminatory measures.''
  If she had said during the markup that she was willing to ban things 
that were discriminatory, it might have been a different situation. We 
might have had a consensus, but that is not what is going on here. This 
says ``QALYs or similar measures,'' not similar discriminatory 
measures.
  Some may say: Well, what is the difference?
  The difference is the word ``discriminatory'' is not in the language 
of the bill.
  We have no problem banning things that are discriminatory, like QALYs 
or similar discriminatory measures, but that is not in there.
  So the problem is that this will be used by pharma to raise prices. 
The vagueness of the language opens up the door to pharma and the drug 
companies to sue and say that negotiated prices and efforts to try to 
reduce costs are not acceptable.
  I am not suggesting that that is what the Republicans have in mind 
necessarily, but that is the reality of it. This is backed by pharma, 
by the pharmaceutical industry because they want to use it to undermine 
every effort the Democrats have made to try to bring down costs for 
prescription drugs in the Medicare market, in the Medicaid market, in 
Veterans Affairs, and on down the list.
  I am deeply concerned that the ambiguity in the bill text would be a 
prime target for litigation by the pharmaceutical industry, an industry 
that has already shown a willingness to sue to keep outrageously high 
prescription drug prices in place.
  We know that Big Pharma is already using similar tactics to try to 
fight the implementation of the Medicare drug price negotiation program 
enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill could give them yet 
another point of entry to undermine Medicare's ongoing work to 
negotiate prescription drug prices.
  Now, in addition, the Congressional Budget Office agreed that this 
legislation will hinder the ability of our Federal health programs to 
lower costs. CBO estimates that this bill will increase spending for 
prescription drugs in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health 
programs, including the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs' 
health programs by $1.1 billion in the next 10 years, and potentially 
tens of billions in the years that follow.
  So because of the fact that this bill raises prices for the Federal 
Government, increases costs for prescription drugs, the Republicans had 
to put a pay-for in the bill.

  The Republican bill before us today would gut the Affordable Care 
Act's Prevention and Public Health Fund in order to pay this $1.1 
billion for the legislation. It has long been the goal of Republicans 
to decimate the ACA's essential funding stream to lower healthcare 
costs through prevention. This funding in the prevention fund goes to 
our State and local partners to improve public health and prevent 
chronic diseases.
  The prevention fund encourages smoking cessation, prevents childhood 
lead poisoning, and enhances infectious disease control.
  This fund plays a critical role in our efforts to help the American 
people live healthier lives. House Republicans' decision to cut the 
prevention fund in order to throw more money at their Big Pharma 
friends makes it clear that they are not interested in reaching 
consensus or finding a bipartisan solution.
  Instead, they would rather jam through a partisan bill that would 
hurt the very communities that they claim to be helping.
  Mr. Chair, this bill is nothing more than a giveaway to Big Pharma at 
the expense of the American people and our Nation's public health. I 
strongly oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to oppose it, as well.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume.
  The reasons that the ranking member says to oppose the bill, they do 
not match what the bill actually says.
  Current law already prohibits the use of QALYs and other similar 
measures in Medicare. Current law reads: ``The Secretary shall not 
utilize such an adjusted life year or (such a similar measure) as a 
threshold to determine coverage. . . . ''
  I am not sure why all of a sudden we have this concern about other 
measures. All the bill would do is apply current Medicare law to other 
Federal payers, and if people are insistent that other measures are not 
discriminatory, then they should have no problem in using them.
  I will also point out to anyone who may be listening, according to 
CBO's cost estimate: ``CBO does not expect that enacting H.R. 485 would 
affect the prices that result from negotiations between the Secretary 
and drug manufacturers.''
  I don't support this capping or government price fixing of drugs. I 
don't support it. I would like to see us work together to reduce the 
cost of drugs, but this bill, according to CBO, does not expect that 
H.R. 485 would affect the prices that result from negotiations between 
the Secretary and drug manufacturers.
  Don't get distracted from the underlying bill here.
  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
Guthrie).

                              {time}  0930

  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 485, the 
Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act led by Energy and Commerce 
Committee Chair Rodgers. This bill would permanently ban the use of 
quality-adjusted life years or similar measures under any Federal 
healthcare program.
  Quality-adjusted life years. Think of that term. Should an academic 
or Washington bureaucrat be able to say some people are more valuable 
than others, that vulnerable populations like those with disabilities 
don't deserve the same access to treatment as others?
  Individuals with disabilities, chronic conditions, and others to whom 
quality-adjusted life years or similar measures may discriminate 
against, deserve the chance to choose which treatments they access 
without a Washington bureaucrat or an academic with no clinical 
experience making the decision for them.
  I support this legislation. I appreciate the chair for bringing it 
forward and sharing her personal story of why this is important. We all 
know and love Cole. I didn't know he wanted to be a race car driver. I 
think I did at 16, as well. He is a wonderful young man, and he 
represents a great group of people who don't deserve to be 
discriminated against.
  Mr. Chair, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do 
so.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Eshoo), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee.
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise, sadly, in opposition to this bill, H.R. 
485.
  I support, and everyone here supports, banning quality-adjusted life 
years, also known as QALYs. It is a discriminatory metric that should 
not be used, and Democrats are the ones who recognized this in 2010 
when we banned Medicare's use of QALYs in the Affordable Care Act.

[[Page H511]]

  If this bill simply banned QALYs, it would pass the House, the 
Senate, and become law. It would become law quickly. However, the 
problem is that the legislation bans QALYs and ``similar measures.'' I 
have repeatedly said that this vague ``similar measures'' phrase is a 
problem, including during the hearing and the markup of the bill.
  This overly broad ``similar measures'' phrase weakens the Federal 
Government's ability to negotiate drug prices by ruling out any type of 
comparative effectiveness. Without this analysis, CBO found that States 
and the Federal Government would have less leverage for drug discounts.
  The CBO estimates that this ``similar measures'' phrase will raise 
Federal costs in Medicaid by nearly half a billion dollars--that is 
with a b--and by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in TRICARE and 
the VA. It also means out-of-pocket costs will rise for veterans and 
Federal workers, and State budgets will be hit by higher Medicaid 
spending.
  Mr. Chair, I have tried everything I could to fix this legislation. I 
voted ``present'' in the markup to continue bipartisan negotiations and 
met with the chairwoman about changing the language, but the bill 
before us today is the same bill that passed out of committee. It adds 
insult to injury because the Republicans are using the Affordable Care 
Act Public Health Prevention Fund to pay for it. Over 170 patient and 
public health groups oppose using this fund as an offset.
  My Republican colleagues have said they wish the legislation could be 
bipartisan, but their actions say otherwise. This bill has only five 
cosponsors, all Republicans, no Democrats. It has a poisonous pay-for, 
and the Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services Committees never heard the 
bill despite its major impact on the VA and TRICARE.
  This is, in my view, a partisan bill that needlessly cuts public 
health to increase drug spending, and that is why I urge my colleagues 
to vote against it.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this bill should be 
bipartisan. This legislation before us today takes the language that 
the Democrats put into the Affordable Care Act, and again I will quote 
it: ``The Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or 
such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage. . . .'' 
We take that language from Medicare inserted by the Democrats in the 
Affordable Care Act, and we apply it to all Federal payers. It should 
be bipartisan.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Bilirakis).
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 485, the 
Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, which would ban the use of 
the quality-adjusted life years metric in our Federal health programs.
  I thank Chair Rodgers for her leadership on this issue and her 
staunch advocacy for American patients, no matter their background. The 
use of QALYs when determining coverage and payment policies in 
healthcare at its core devalues the lives of patients with disabilities 
and chronic conditions.
  As co-chair of the Rare Disease Caucus, I am concerned about how the 
use of QALY metric impacts payment decisions for chronic rare disorder 
patients, potentially making it more difficult for them to get access 
to lifesaving treatments. We can't have that.
  I am also concerned about how this metric could be used by 
bureaucrats to make decisions that discriminate against our Nation's 
disabled veterans, our heroes. These lives have value and should not be 
discriminated against when determining the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments, plain and simple.
  Pricing measurements and discriminatory methodologies such as QALYs 
have been condemned by the National Council on Disability. Even the 
Affordable Care Act contained a narrow ban of this metric, and I guess 
into Medicare, and I am disappointed that the Democrats have decided to 
turn their back on individuals with preexisting conditions like they 
have here today.
  Let's ban this metric and support H.R. 485, which has been endorsed 
by the National Down Syndrome Society. Disability Rights Education & 
Defense Fund, and more than 100 other disability and patient advocacy 
groups. That speaks volumes, as far as I am concerned. I thank the 
chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee for putting this forward, 
and let's pass it today.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 485, 
the so-called Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2023.
  I have to say that it is a bit rich to hear my colleague talk about 
preexisting conditions and their party's concern for it when he has 
been part of the party that has been completely opposed to protecting 
people with preexisting conditions because they have repeatedly, over 
and over, tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  The bill before us today does almost nothing to protect healthcare 
for patients and, instead, would likely increase healthcare costs 
across the board.
  As the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am 
especially alarmed at the impact this bill would potentially have on 
our veterans' care, and I have to say I wonder why this bill was not 
referred also to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, given its impact on 
this jurisdiction.
  Under current law, multiple Federal programs like VA's have special 
pricing arrangements for prescription drugs that rely on up-front 
discounts and rebates. It is a win-win system for both taxpayers and 
veterans.
  The VA keeps costs lower and is able to make sure veterans get access 
to the drugs they need. In fact, I would daresay the Department of 
Veterans Affairs has the most robust negotiations over the drugs on its 
formulary. However, this bill would upend this proven system and 
instead inject uncertainty into drug pricing.
  That chaos has a very real cost for VA and DOD: $240 million for the 
2023-2033 time period, according to the CBO. ``Other similar measures'' 
simply does seem to have a measurable effect for CBO, those words, 
``other similar measures.'' This will diminish VA's ability to deliver 
care to veterans and force the Department to make cuts to services 
elsewhere.
  Consequently, that begs the question, who benefits from this 
disarray? Big Pharma does. They reap the rewards and push up their 
profits. I have to say, their lobbyists will really have earned their 
outrageously large paycheck if this bill passes because it is so 
clearly a rip-off. Taxpayers and veterans lose, while Big Pharma wins? 
Give me a break.
  However, House Democrats are opposed to this blatant rip-off and will 
fight it tooth and nail. Instead of doing Big Pharma's bidding, we are 
focused on lowering drug prices for Americans. House Democrats are 
proud to have worked with the Biden administration to deliver on 
capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for seniors, finally 
allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, and 
requiring drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise 
prices faster than inflation.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Luttrell). The time of the gentleman has 
expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California.
  Mr. TAKANO. Let me add, Democrats have also locked in $800 per year 
in health insurance savings for 15 million Americans.
  Members should ask themselves who has more credibility on protecting 
Americans' healthcare and saving them money and lowering costs. I would 
submit the Democrats do.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. It will cost 
taxpayers money, it will cost the VA more money, and just give more 
profits to Big Pharma.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, if you go to the VA's website, they 
have an entire page devoted to QALYs where they say outright, to date 
the quality-adjusted life year is the preferred metric for estimating 
health effects. There is a perfect example of what we are talking about 
right there on the VA website.
  Mr. Chairman, I had surgery December 28, and I have been on this 
scooter ever since. It really does give you a different perspective for 
people with disabilities. For me, it is temporary, but

[[Page H512]]

it has made me realize that people with disabilities, people with 
certain health challenges, it is not temporary for them. They deal with 
this all the time.
  Are they any less of a person than I am or than you are? No.
  That is what we are trying to say here. They deserve the same 
treatment as anyone else does.
  I am in strong support of this Protecting Health Care for All 
Patients Act because it will expand access to lifesaving treatments and 
prevent discrimination against Americans with disabilities.
  The way that we come up from the Rayburn Building up to the second 
floor, to the House Chamber, well, you know those escalators are broken 
right now. The other day, I am coming up, trying to make it to a vote. 
Both escalators are broken. I tried to get on the elevator, and someone 
has changed the elevator to where you have to have a badge to get on 
it. If there had not been someone who came by with a badge, I would 
still be sitting there right now.

                              {time}  0945

  This is serious. This is what we are talking about. These are real 
people. This is good legislation, and I thank the gentlewoman for 
bringing this. I support this, and I hope you will, too.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. Fletcher), a member of our Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 485, the so-
called Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2023.
  This legislation harms the very people it says it protects, increases 
prescription drug costs, and decimates funding for essential public 
health programs.
  Last Congress, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, landmark 
legislation that gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the 
power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare. This critical step is 
estimated to lower drug prices by at least 25 percent, saving seniors 
and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and ensuring that people with 
Medicare get better, fairer prices for prescription drugs.
  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that this 
provision in the IRA alone will save the government $100 billion over 
the next 10 years. In contrast, the CBO estimates that the bill before 
us today would not only increase drug prices across Federal health 
programs, but it would also increase Federal spending by $1.1 billion 
over the next 10 years by eliminating important tools to manage drug 
prices. Without effective tools to determine the value of a drug, the 
government is at a disadvantage, and the taxpayers pay the higher 
price.
  We know that 8 in 10 adults in the United States today say that the 
cost of prescription drugs is too high, and we know that 3 in 10 say 
that they don't take all of their prescriptions as prescribed because 
they can't afford them. It is simply unacceptable.
  It is unacceptable that Americans struggle so much to pay for the 
lifesaving and critical drugs that they need to ensure their quality of 
life.
  Just last week, the Biden administration announced that it had sent 
initial offers to participating drug companies for the first 10 drugs 
selected for price negotiation, a milestone in implementing the IRA. 
These 10 drugs alone cost seniors $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas.
  Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chair, let me repeat that: These 10 drugs alone 
cost seniors $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2022.
  While Democrats and President Biden are fighting for lower drug 
costs, House Republicans want to stop negotiations altogether.
  Democrats are delivering, and we will continue to work to lower 
prescription drug prices for seniors and families across our country, 
but this bill does not do that.
  For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to 
recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I 
would have offered this motion with an important amendment to the bill 
to prevent this bill from taking effect until the Secretaries of HHS, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management, certify that it will not result in an increase in 
prescription drug prices or an increase in patient costs in the United 
States.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.

       Mrs. Fletcher moves to recommit the bill H.R. 485 to the 
     Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report 
     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following 
     amendment:
       Add at the end the following new section:

     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

       The amendments made by this Act shall not take effect until 
     the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense, and 
     Veterans Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Personnel 
     Management certify that such amendments will not result in an 
     increase in prescription drug prices or an increase in 
     patient costs in the United States.

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, if this legislation harms 
people who we are intending to help, why do we have support letters 
from nearly 200 disability patient advocate groups across the political 
spectrum? Down Syndrome Society, Autism Speaks, Disability Law Center, 
and ARC all support this bill.
  If the Democrats want to suggest that they are committed to lowering 
the cost of prescription drugs and that the reason to oppose this bill 
is because it is going to increase costs, the only reason this bill 
would increase costs is if you are denying care to people who have 
disabilities. That is the only reason. You are discriminating against 
people. That is the only reason this bill would cost any money.
  CBO already estimates that this bill is going to cost $1.1 billion. 
Why is that? Why would this legislation cost $1.1 billion? Because CBO 
is forecasting that there are going to be discriminatory measures used 
against individuals, and we are going to ban that. We are going to make 
sure that doesn't happen.
  Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I specifically thank Chair McMorris Rodgers for her 
incredible work on this vital legislation.
  As America continues to lead the way in research, development, and 
innovation of new therapies and medical devices, it is vital that these 
cures are available to the Americans who need them the most.
  That is why today we are taking action to expand healthcare options 
to more patients than ever before by banning the use of quality-
adjusted life years in all Federal programs.
  More than 55,000 veterans live in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional 
District, many of whom were injured or disabled while serving in 
uniform for our country. For years, I cared for patients at the Van 
Zandt VA Medical Center in Blair County. This legislation will provide 
more protection for disabled veterans.
  By passing the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, we can 
ensure that institutions like the VA will never again use QALY formulas 
to determine if a disabled veteran should receive the treatment that 
they need, should receive the treatment that they deserve.
  It is time to ensure that patients are protected and receiving the 
best quality care. All Americans, all patients, deserve that.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Republicans are pointing to the Congressional Budget Office's score 
of their bill as proof that healthcare programs are already using the 
QALY to discriminate against people, but that is simply not what the 
CBO score says.
  It is ironic Republicans would point to CBO's analysis, given it 
highlights my exact concern that this bill's reference to other 
``similar measures'' is ambiguous and undermines drug price 
negotiations.
  It is precisely this uncertainty that would result in a chilling 
effect on States and Federal agencies being willing to look at the cost 
of prescription drugs.
  Again, I take no issue with banning QALYs, and I offered an amendment 
in committee to ban QALYs when this

[[Page H513]]

bill was marked up, but that is not what this is about.
  This is an effort by the Republicans to back up pharma and make sure 
that we don't look at cost measures; that we don't negotiate prices, 
which they oppose in Medicare; and that we simply let the 
pharmaceutical companies charge whatever they want.
  Imagine what it would be like if the pharmaceutical companies could 
charge whatever they want. Not only would it cost another $1.1 billion, 
which is what the CBO says, but it could undermine any efforts to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs throughout any Federal and State 
programs.
  What does that mean? What does that mean for people? How would we 
continue to fund programs for seniors, for the disabled, for anyone if 
we cannot adjust the cost issue and keep costs down for prescription 
drugs?
  There is no effort here on the Democrats' part to continue with 
QALYs. We are opposed to them, but you have to continue to be able to 
look at costs in a nondiscriminatory way.
  That is what is not going to happen if this bill becomes law. There 
will not be any way or any effective way for any Federal, State, or 
local agencies to look at cost measures, and costs will continue to 
skyrocket, exactly what pharma wants.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).
  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for yielding time.
  I am proud to support the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act 
championed by my good friend and a true leader, Chairwoman Rodgers.
  We need to recognize and affirm that every life is precious and a 
gift from God. It is unconscionable that healthcare payers use quality-
adjusted life years as a measurement to determine if treatment options 
for patients are cost-effective.
  Federal healthcare programs should provide patients with the best 
care available, regardless of preexisting conditions and those 
suffering with disabilities.
  It is important we find fiscally and ethically responsible solutions 
to reduce healthcare costs in this country without devaluing the 
sanctity of life.
  Mr. Chair, I urge support for final passage.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger).
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of Chair 
Rodgers' Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, which addresses 
the Federal Government's discriminatory practices toward disabled and 
chronically ill patients through the use of quality-adjusted life 
years.

  Quality-adjusted life years are used by bureaucrats and healthcare 
administrators to assign a numerical value to an individual's life, 
which is then used to make coverage decisions for medical treatments 
and services.
  Current law already largely prevents the Department of Health and 
Human Services from using this metric in Medicare ``in a manner that 
treats extending the life of an elderly, disabled, or terminally ill 
individual as of lower value.'' This discriminatory metric has even 
been proposed to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services.
  The bottom line is this: The Federal Government should not play a 
role in determining the value of a patient's life.
  As a pharmacist for over 30 years, I understand that ensuring 
patients with disabilities and chronic illnesses have continued access 
to quality care is of utmost performance.
  The Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act will ban the use of 
quality-adjusted life years in Federal healthcare programs, expanding 
access to healthcare for Americans and protecting patients across the 
country.
  As a healthcare provider, we take an oath to first do no harm. Mr. 
Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this landmark legislation led by 
Chair McMorris Rodgers and put the interests of patients first.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks)
  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 485, 
the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act.
  Quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs, are a metric used to assign a 
dollar value on someone's life and ration healthcare treatments 
accordingly, often discriminating against those with disabilities.
  This isn't the first time we have heard this. I remember a former 
President, in advocating for the Affordable Care Act, said if someone 
has a broken hip, and they are elderly, they are just going to have to 
deal with it.
  Current law prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from 
using QALYs in Medicare specifically in a manner that treats extending 
the life of an elderly, disabled, or terminally ill individual as of 
lower value.
  This legislation simply extends the QALYs prohibition to other 
Federal healthcare programs not included under current law.
  As a doctor, it is outrageous for government bureaucrats to determine 
whether a person's life is worth saving.
  It is interesting to hear the other side of the aisle concerned about 
cost after advancing the Affordable Care Act when they knew it would 
lead to increased costs, increased premiums, which it has done, and 
patients losing their doctors and their healthcare plans.
  If my colleagues are concerned about veterans' affairs, I happen to 
be the chair of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs. We can introduce this there, as well.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

                              {time}  1000

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).
  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend and colleague, 
Representative McMorris Rodgers for yielding.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 485, the Protecting Health 
Care for all Patients Act. This bill, led by Chairwoman Rodgers, would 
prohibit all Federal healthcare programs from using quality-adjusted 
life years, or as you may hear them called, QALYs, as criteria to 
determine coverage for often life-altering treatments for patients. 
Quality-adjusted life years are measures that discount the value of a 
life based on disability, age, or terminal illness, and are currently 
used by all Federal healthcare payers, except for Medicare.
  Put plainly, programs like Medicaid and the Department of Veterans 
Affairs allow unelected, nameless, faceless bureaucrats to put a dollar 
value on the life of a patient to determine whether the treatment is 
cost-effective or not. In doing so, these programs and agencies 
discount an individual's worth and need for medical care based upon 
their disability status and whether they have a chronic illness.
  Ultimately, the use of QALYs amounts to discrimination, something 
that is all too common in our healthcare system. Patients with 
disabilities, for instance, are often denied the ability to receive 
lifesaving organ transplants.
  As the sponsor of the Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant 
Discrimination Prevention Act, I personally and firmly believe that 
patients with disabilities and other chronic conditions should receive 
equal treatment, whether it is for an organ transplant or coverage of 
essential medicines.
  I applaud Chairwoman Rodgers' efforts to protect the lives of all 
patients, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  No bureaucrat should be able to coldly determine the life and value 
of a patient.
  This bill that we have an opportunity to vote on today is a huge step 
forward in fighting discrimination within our healthcare system.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.

[[Page H514]]

  

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how 
much time is remaining on each side.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington has 8 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 13 minutes remaining.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio, (Mr. Wenstrup).
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I rise here today in support of H.R. 485, 
the Protecting Health Care for all Patients Act, and I thank Chairwoman 
McMorris Rodgers for bringing this important legislation forward.
  I am a physician who is proud to join my colleagues in leading this 
bill that bans the use of quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, as it is 
called, in all Federal programs.
  As a physician I took an oath, determined to treat each patient as a 
human being first and foremost. Quality metrics intentionally devalue 
treatments for disabled and chronically ill patients in determining 
whether a treatment is cost-effective. In other words, telling the 
patient, you are not worth it.
  The bottom line is this: These cost measurements put an artificial 
dollar value on a person's life, valuing the lives of Americans 
differently.
  In doing so, QALYs interferes with the sacred duty of a physician to 
care for all patients equally. Treating all patients equally and with a 
personal touch is something that I have always taken great pride in.
  Our healthcare system must value all lives and ensure every person is 
treated with dignity. Our government should never deny healthcare to 
all Americans based on how much a life is perceived to be worth. This 
is a check on our morality. This is a check on our values. We should 
value human life and work towards healthier human lives, not devalue 
human life nor indignify one another.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to join me in blocking government 
bureaucrats from putting an arbitrary price tag on the life of every 
American--bureaucrats that will never meet you or take responsibility 
for your care.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt that the pharmaceutical industry 
would like to see the gains we have made to lower drug prices through 
the Inflation Reduction Act halted or reversed. That is why they have 
brought numerous Federal lawsuits against the law in courts throughout 
the country, even as the Department of Health and Human Services just 
announced opening offers for the first 10 drugs selected for 
negotiation to bring down costs.
  This bill would simply provide a new avenue for the pharmaceutical 
industry to pursue litigation intended to hamper the IRA and the 
negotiation program overall, and it doesn't stop there. It could strip 
States of one of the only tools that they have to negotiate Medicaid 
drug rebates.
  Now, while proponents of this legislation would have you believe that 
this bill just extends current law, unfortunately, that is not the 
case. It expands and changes current law. It applies the language from 
the Inflation Reduction Act in a new context and broadens its 
applicability to ban the use of other similar measures across the 
Federal Government, and that means limiting the ability to look at 
costs. If we don't have the ability to compare drugs and see which ones 
are effective and which ones cost more, then we won't have the ability 
to lower costs. What that means is we allow pharma to charge whatever 
they want.

  The CBO says this is going to cost another $1.1 billion, which is why 
the Republicans seek to cut the Prevention and Public Health Fund to 
pay for it. But this is going to lead us down the path of saying that 
we can't look at cost at all. That means that costs will balloon for 
Medicare, for Medicaid, and for prescription drugs. The consequence of 
that is you can't pay for other programs that help seniors, that help 
poor people, that help veterans, that help those in the military with 
their health and the quality of their health.
  This is a very dangerous piece of legislation, and Democrats are 
speaking out against it because of the consequences and our ability to 
fund health programs around the country at every level.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Protecting 
Health Care for all Patients Act of 2023 led by Chairwoman Rodgers.
  I rise today not only as a Congressman, Mr. Chair, but as a father to 
a 21-year-old man with Down syndrome, a young man who has never been 
defined by his disability, but rather, his ability. The use of quality-
adjusted life years is disgusting.
  Mr. Chair, it is disgusting. Using a cost benefit analysis to 
determine if someone deserves healthcare, if their life has value, is 
just plain wrong, Mr. Chair.
  This is the result of socialized healthcare medicine, the future that 
the Democrats want. It is a future where a doctor will turn you away 
because your treatment just doesn't make economic sense.
  This is called rationalized healthcare, Mr. Chair, meaning the 
government will determine if your life is worth living. The bureaucrats 
in Washington, D.C., will determine if the lives of senior citizens in 
northern Minnesota should be saved and healthcare provided to them.
  I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for introducing this bill, which prevents 
the Federal healthcare programs from deciding the future of not only my 
son but all the children in this country that have a disability--from 
deciding if their life is valuable in comparison to others.
  This bill is a beacon of hope for families like mine and the hundreds 
of thousands across this great Nation who are blessed to have children 
living with Down syndrome and other disabilities that enrich our 
communities. It is a promise that we will not stand idly by while our 
most vulnerable citizens are viewed as less than in a broken healthcare 
system.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Perry). The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Minnesota.
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair, this bill ensures that individuals with 
disabilities, the elderly, our veterans, and the terminally ill are 
protected from discrimination and have access to affordable, 
comprehensive healthcare.
  Let me tell you something. I am a spouse of an Iraq war veteran, and 
if you look on the Department of Veterans Affairs' site, Mr. Chair, 
they have quality-adjusted life years for our veterans. Since when do 
we determine the life of a veteran who signed up to give his or her 
life for this Nation, Mr. Chair?
  The Democrats want to take it away, quality-adjusted life years. It 
is sad.
  We are fighting for our elderly, the veterans, and our disabled 
community. For the bureaucrats to tell me or tell any of us whether a 
life is worth living or not is unconscionable, and we will not stand 
for it.
  Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this bill to the 
floor, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, the Republicans' decision to offset this bill by 
raiding the Prevention and Public Health Fund underscores the real 
intentions. They are not seeking to improve the lives of those with 
disabilities or end the use of discriminatory measures, but to push 
forward with a partisan bill that will raise prices and cut critical 
funding used to improve public health.
  The Prevention and Public Health Fund was established in the 
Affordable Care Act to provide for expanded and sustained national 
investment in health prevention and restrain the rate of growth in 
healthcare costs. Republicans have consistently sought to undermine, 
slash, and redirect these essential funds for unintended purposes.
  Cutting the Prevention and Public Health Fund decimates our ability 
to effectively prepare for the next pandemic, respond to ongoing public 
health threats, and puts our States and local healthcare partners at a 
disadvantage moving forward.

[[Page H515]]

  Nearly 200 public health organizations sent a letter earlier this 
week expressing strong concerns with the manager's amendment, noting 
how detrimental cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund would be.
  It is the height of irony that Republicans claim this bill would 
reduce discrimination for those with disabilities, while also cutting 
Federal investment in programs that improve the lives of those with 
disabilities.
  The American people deserve better.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Chairman, I feel very strongly about why we need to oppose this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
  Democrats, and, hopefully, some Republicans, too, have spent a lot of 
time trying to reduce the cost of prescription drugs--and the States, 
as well. The bottom line is that we know that prescription drugs 
now are, if not the majority, a significant portion of healthcare 
costs.

  If the Federal Government or the State government, or any government, 
is going to continue to provide quality care in this country, we must 
rein in the cost of prescription drugs, not only the cost but also have 
our agencies determine what drugs are effective and what drugs are not. 
We have no problem as Democrats in banning QALYs.
  I have said that over and over again today, and I will keep repeating 
it. The bottom line is the way the language of this bill is 
constructed, it could easily lead to a situation where no Federal, 
State or government agency could effectively look at whether or not a 
drug is effective and what the cost is or make any decisions to pay for 
it based on the actual costs.
  Now, sure, we could live in a world where the government pays 
unlimited amounts of money for everything--and I am sure pharma would 
love that because they like to charge whatever they want to increase 
their profits--but that is not a real situation. If you don't rein in 
the cost of prescription drugs, it not only is going to cost more for 
individuals out of their pocket, but it also means that the government 
can't provide services to people with disabilities or to seniors or to 
veterans.
  That is why the CBO was saying that this bill is going to cost 
another $1.1 billion, at a minimum, and possibly even more in the 
future, if you read what the CBO has actually said.
  Republicans have a pay-for rule, so they say that if it is going to 
cost more, they have to pay for it in some way.
  Well, how do they pay for it?
  They cut the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the very fund that is 
used to prevent worse diseases, worse outbreaks, fund local public 
health programs so they can deal with public health in an effective 
way.
  How is that beneficial to people with disabilities or anyone? It 
certainly isn't.
  That is why there is so much opposition by various public health 
agencies to cutting this prevention fund to pay for this bill.

                              {time}  1015

  There is no justification for this bill. There was an opportunity in 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. I submitted language that would say 
not only would we ban QALYs, but we would ban any kind of 
discriminatory measures being used. The Republicans wouldn't accept 
that. This is what we are left with, a bill that is very dangerous, 
that is just a giveaway to pharma.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose what I consider rather 
dangerous legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.
  We have worked together on important legislation to lower costs, 
provide more transparency, bipartisan legislation from the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. I am quite disappointed today that my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle have refused to come to the table on 
this one.
  We just heard that there is no justification for this legislation. 
The ranking member actually said it is dangerous. Let me just point out 
again, nearly 200 advocacy groups, spanning the political spectrum, are 
calling on Congress to prohibit the use of QALYs and other 
discriminatory measures, perhaps because they see the VA's website 
today. Go to the VA's website and you will read, to date, the quality-
adjusted life year, QALY, is the preferred metric for estimating health 
effect.
  We have also heard that this bill is a big giveaway, a blank check, 
to pharma. Republicans agree, we must lower the cost of prescription 
drugs, and we have worked on it. Discriminatory action, discriminatory 
metrics against people with disabilities and chronic illnesses is not 
the way to do it.
  We have heard today that the offset is a partisan pill. Let me just 
highlight that Senator Sanders is using the prevention fund. Senator 
Sanders is proposing right now to use the prevention fund to offset 
increased funding for community health centers. The Senate passed this 
provision 90-6. It is disappointing that now this is an issue of 
offsetting costs of no longer discriminating against those with 
disabilities.
  Yes, we have to offset the cost of no longer discriminating against 
those with disabilities. That is why there is even a CBO score on this 
bill.
  I also note that ``similar measures,'' which seems to be an issue 
today with my colleagues across the aisle, are current law for 
Medicare. We are simply expanding that same language in Medicare to 
other Federal health programs. Why have different standards?
  Mr. Chair, this should be the law of the land. This legislation is 
important. Those with disabilities and the advocacy groups are asking 
for Congress to take action. We have addressed the issues in the 
underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I urge support. I hope today that we can come together, 
Republicans and Democrats, as Americans, to protect the healthcare and 
the access to healthcare for every individual with disabilities and 
chronic illnesses. As I mentioned, we are all just one car accident or 
diagnosis away from being that person. Vote ``yes.''
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 485, the so-
called Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act.
  The truth is this bill fails to protect health care for all patients. 
Instead, this bill undermines the Affordable Care Act by stripping 
funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, our nation's first 
mandatory funding system dedicated to improving our nation's public 
health system and lowering public health care costs. This critical 
funding has helped the Centers for Disease Control reduce the leading 
causes of death and disability nationwide and support early detection 
of and response to public health threats.
  This legislation is a step in the wrong direction. If passed, this 
bill would make it more difficult to improve the affordability of 
prescription drugs. House Republicans claim that this bill will help 
prevent discriminatory policies because it prohibits Medicaid, Medicare 
Advantage (MA) plans, Medicare Part D Plans (PDPs), the VA, and the 
Defense Health Agency from using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). 
The truth is federal law already prohibits Medicare from using QALYs in 
its coverage determinations, and state Medicare plans are required by 
law to cover all drugs.
  If House Republicans were serious about ensuring all Americans have 
access to affordable, comprehensive health care treatments, they would 
have supported clarifying amendments to this bill that would ban 
discriminatory practices. Instead, we are presented with another bill 
that does not address the problem and does not put the interests of 
patients and taxpayers first.
  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, modified by the 
amendment printed in part A of House Report 118-374, shall be 
considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the 
original bill for the purpose of further amendment and shall be 
considered as read.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Molinaro

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part B of House Report 118-374.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following new section:

     SEC. 3. REPORT.

       Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act, and annually thereafter, the Comptroller General of 
     the United States shall submit to Congress a report on how 
     quality-adjusted life years negatively impacts individuals 
     with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their 
     access to care.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Molinaro) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chair, I begin first by expressing my support for 
the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act and my appreciation to 
the leadership of Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers.
  This bill seeks to address a longstanding concern for the disability 
community, a community that I have spent the better part of the last 20 
years working in and among. It bans the use of quality-adjusted life 
years, QALYs, measures from being used in Federal healthcare programs.
  As we know, QALY measures have devalued the lives of disabled and 
chronically ill patients when it comes to deciding if a certain 
treatment is cost effective, putting a dollar sign on their lives and 
barriers to accessing proper treatment.
  You heard a moment ago my colleague across the aisle refer to the 
bill in chief as dangerous. As the parent of a child living with 
epilepsy and on the autism spectrum, I can tell you what is dangerous 
is the way in which the healthcare system too often treats children and 
adults like her. It is neither progressive nor compassionate to put a 
dollar sign on the lives of those who need such life-affirming care.
  The use of QALYs has put those with chronic illnesses and 
disabilities, like epilepsy, ALS, and Down syndrome, at the back of the 
line for treatment, too often denying them access and creating barriers 
to the support they need. It undermines our commitment to life-
affirming care for our most vulnerable. No matter how it is expressed, 
no matter how it is denied, this practice devalues the lives of 
American citizens and loved ones like my own child.
  My amendment seeks to provide additional oversight into the negative 
impact QALYs have on those with intellectual, developmental, and 
physical disabilities.
  The amendment is simple. It directs the Comptroller General to submit 
a report to Congress to thoroughly assess the damage QALYs have on our 
IDD community and how this measure adversely affects their access to 
lifesaving treatments and medical care. It is simple and meant to 
provide additional oversight.
  As noted, as the father of four children, one who lives on the autism 
spectrum with a seizure disorder, and a staunch advocate for our 
disability community, I again applaud Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers' work 
on crafting the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act to ensure 
our most vulnerable populations have access to the medical treatments 
and services to manage their conditions and lead longer, healthier, and 
freer lives.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I appreciate and respect the views of the 
disability community and their strongly held belief that the use of 
QALYs in Federal health programs is discriminatory. That is why I do 
not oppose this amendment.
  However, the amendment does not cure the problem with the underlying 
bill. This bill is a Trojan horse that purports to ban discriminatory 
measures like QALYs but in reality does a

[[Page H517]]

lot more. This bill has the potential to ban a broad swath of cost 
containment measures that are not discriminatory and could harm the 
very communities that this bill is purported to help.
  Those with disabilities need access to lower drug prices and 
healthcare services, and the Federal Government's and States' ability 
to use nondiscriminatory health measures is essential to bringing down 
costs. Otherwise, without leverage to get a better deal, we are stuck 
paying whatever pharma wants. The CBO agrees. That is why they estimate 
this bill will increase Federal spending by over a billion dollars in 
the next 10 years and potentially tens of billions of dollars more in 
the years ahead.
  For this reason, I do not oppose the amendment, but, unfortunately, 
it does not resolve my concerns with the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's support of the 
amendment. I will close with addressing the ``yes, but'' argument.
  Those who live with intellectual, physical, and developmental 
disabilities and those who love them are quite familiar with the ``yes, 
but'' argument. Yes, we care about you, but others face struggles, too. 
Yes, we want you to have access, but others may have obstacles, too. 
Yes, we care about your lives, but we care about others more.
  That is the basis of the argument against this bill, ``yes, but.'' My 
daughter has heard it every day of her life. I have experienced it 
every day. Yes, we hope to educate her, but we don't have time for it. 
Yes, we want to give you access to vaccines and care, but you are not 
our priority. Yes, during COVID we wanted to ensure every life was 
protected, but we didn't have the time to work it out for you.
  This bill is not perfect. The chairwoman doesn't expect it to be, nor 
do I. QALYs devalue the lives of Americans who have far too many 
obstacles in their place.
  My argument in response to the argument against this bill is ``yes, 
but.'' Yes, kids like mine deserve access to quality care; yes, those 
with disabilities deserve to have life-affirming services; and, yes, 
those with disabilities face far too many obstacles to living and 
pursuing a life of happiness; but we can take this one step.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman for 
yielding.
  We want to rise and help all of the families, particularly those 
families who every day are dealing with children and family members 
with disabilities.

  This is an instance where I say can we all get together and can we 
try to find a resolution toward making sure that we have good 
healthcare for these families and for these persons?
  What I would offer is that presently this legislation undermines the 
Affordable Care Act by stripping dollars from the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund and undermining its critical investments in health and 
well-being. It makes it very difficult to help those who need help. It 
would stop funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which 
supports critical investments to help prevent disease.
  At the same time, this legislation opens the possibility of limiting 
the use of any value metrics when determining a drug price.
  Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office determined that this 
bill would raise drug costs for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Department 
of Defense. The CBO also estimates that this legislation would increase 
costs for Veterans Affairs health programs, raising Federal spending on 
prescription drugs by $1.115 billion over 10 years and billions more in 
the following decades.
  Americans are looking for answers, and they are looking for answers 
for all persons who need healthcare. To pay for these increased costs, 
there are plans to cut from the Prevention and Public Health Fund and 
cutting programs to improve public health and to prevent chronic 
diseases such as childhood lead poisoning and improving immunization 
rates.
  Democrats in Congress, along with the Biden-Harris administration, 
are working to ensure all Americans have access to affordable care and 
effective healthcare treatments. This bill claims to protect people 
from discrimination. It would, in fact, result in harm to patients if 
enacted into law.

                              {time}  1030

  I believe that people with disabilities deserve equality, inclusion, 
and access to all aspects of American life.
  Instead of prioritizing legislation that could lower prices for them, 
access value, and improve health, Republicans are attempting to pass 
legislation that undermines the work that we have done over a 10-year 
period to really include the disabled community.
  If this bill is enacted, then the language referring to similar 
measures in the current version of the bill would introduce ambiguity 
across the health sector. It could invite lengthy lawsuits from an 
industry eager to stop any efforts to constrain its ability to set 
prices as high as it wants.
  I simply want to say, as I started, can we all work together?
  All aspects of our community need access to good healthcare--
certainly, our disabled community--and this does more to undermine 
their access than to expand their access.
  Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to send this back to the committee so 
that we can find common ground and really serve the disabled community 
and many others and not allow those who seek profit to overcome those 
who seek good healthcare, including our seniors, our veterans, and many 
aspects of our community that have chronic diseases.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to discuss the issue concerning H.R. 485, the 
Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act.
  The Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2023 does not 
protect health care for patients, but rather undermines our progress in 
lowering prescription drug costs for American families.
  This bill claims to prevent the federal government from using a 
measure called the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY).
  This is a red herring, as the Inflation Reduction Act already 
explicitly prohibits the use of QALYs.
  The legislation goes further by banning the use of the QALY ``or such 
a similar measure,'' across all federal health care programs, without 
defining what such a similar measure could include.
  A long-standing criticism of QALY has been that it would:
  Discriminate against people in poor health.
  Extending the lives of individuals with underlying health conditions 
gains fewer QALYs than extending the lives of `healthier' individuals.
  This blanket prohibition on the use of ``similar measures'' applied 
across the federal government.
  This legislation opens the possibility of limiting the use of any 
value metrics when determining a drug's price.
  Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office determined that this 
bill would raise drug costs in Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of 
Defense (DoD).
  CBO also estimates that this legislation would increase costs for 
Veterans Affairs health programs, raising federal spending on 
prescription drugs by $1.115 billion over 10 years and billions more in 
the proceeding decades.
  Americans are looking for Congress to lower drug prices further, not 
increase them.
  To pay for these increased costs, there are plans to cut from the 
Prevention and Public Health Fund and cutting programs to improve 
public health and prevent chronic diseases, such as childhood lead 
poisoning, and improving immunization rates.
  Democrats in Congress along with the Biden Harris Administration are 
working to ensure all Americans have access to affordable and effective 
health care treatments.
  This bill claims to protect people from discrimination but would in 
fact result in harm to patients if enacted into law.
  I believe that people with disabilities deserve equality, inclusion, 
and access in all aspects of American life.
  Instead of prioritizing legislation that could lower prices, assess 
value, and improve health Republicans are attempting to pass 
legislation that undermines the work of Congress and the Biden 
Administration.
  If this bill is enacted the language referring to ``similar 
measures'' in the current version of the bill would introduce ambiguity 
across the health sector.
  It could invite lengthy lawsuits from an industry eager to stop any 
efforts to constrain its ability to set prices as high as it wants for 
any drug--regardless of the drug's value.

[[Page H518]]

  In closing, it is imperative that health care be made affordable for 
those with disabilities.
  Disabled patients in this country deserve a reliable health care 
system.
  We need to consider real legislation that will address prescription 
drug pricing at its core.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, due to a family emergency, I was unable 
to be present for votes today. Had I been present, I would have voted 
``no'' on rollcall No. 39 and ``aye'' on rollcall No. 40.


                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I mistakenly voted ``nay'' on 
Motion to Recommit H.R. 485, rollcall Vote 39. I intended to vote 
``yea.'' Additionally, I regrettably missed recording my vote On 
Passage of H.R. 485, rollcall Vote 40. Had I recorded my vote, I would 
have voted ``no.''

                    PROTECTING AMERICANS' HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting Health 
Care for All Patients Act of 2023. This important legislation aims to 
prevent discrimination against Americans with disabilities and expand 
access to lifesaving cures.
  It would end the use of quality-adjusted life years in all Federal 
programs. Quality-adjusted life years are factors used to rank whether 
a patient is worth the expense of a particular treatment. This rubric 
intentionally devalues treatment for those who have disabilities and 
those with chronic illnesses. This practice has been widely 
investigated by various nonpartisan groups, and yet QALYs are only 
prohibited to Medicare in a limited fashion.
  We know of countries using these metrics much more aggressively to 
decide which treatments they will fund. We must stand against that in 
the United States. The government shouldn't decide which lives are 
valuable enough for care.

                          ____________________

rules and pass the bill.

  (Ms. STANSBURY asked and was given permission to address the House

for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to wish everybody who is 
celebrating in New Mexico and across the world a very happy Lunar New 
Year.
  This Saturday, we will begin the Year of the Dragon, a symbol of 
strength, wisdom, and success.
  Across New Mexico and the world, many will be celebrating with family 
and community traditions and joyful feasts. This holiday is a chance to 
reset and reconnect and is part of our history and culture as New 
Mexicans and the beautiful multicultural fabric that makes New Mexico 
who we are.
  I hope all who are celebrating have a wonderful Lunar New Year full 
of celebrations and, of course, lots of delicious food. I wish everyone 
a happy, healthy, and prosperous Year of the Dragon.

                       CELEBRATING LUNAR NEW YEAR

  (Mrs. KIM of California asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate Lunar New 
Year, Seollal, and Tet Festival as we ring in the new Year of the 
Dragon, symbolizing strength, power, and good fortune.
  I wish success, opportunities, happiness, and good changes for you 
and your family this new year.
  In Congress, I will embody the fighting spirit of the dragon to keep 
breaking through the partisan gridlock and delivering results to keep 
our communities safe and prosperous, make life more affordable, and 
expand opportunities for Americans to achieve their dreams.
  Please allow me to offer best wishes to everyone in different Asian 
languages:
  Korean: ``saehae bok mani badeuseyo''

  Vietnamese: ``Chuc Mung Nam Moi''.
  Happy new year.

                    STRONGER AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS

  (Ms. McCLELLAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCLELLAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the 
Environmental Protection Agency on finalizing a stronger air pollution 
standard that will protect communities and achieve better outcomes 
across our Nation.
  Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris administration, the EPA 
strengthened the national air ambient quality standard for soot, from 
12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9. Today's final rule is a major step 
toward addressing one of the most dangerous environmental health risks 
in the country.
  As is too often the case, low-income communities and communities of 
color are disproportionately impacted by soot pollution and experience 
worse health outcomes as a result, including higher rates of 
respiratory illnesses, particularly asthma, heart attacks, cancer, and 
infant mortality.
  Strengthening these standards will prevent 4,500 premature deaths, 
avoid 290,000 lost workdays, and result in as much as $46 billion in 
public health benefits.
  Shortly after being sworn in, I called on the EPA to curb soot 
pollution and finalize a strong rule, and I am grateful for the 
administration's action which will begin to address historic inequities 
in our marginalized communities across the Nation.

                          ____________________

                RECLAIM CONGRESS' POLICYMAKING AUTHORITY

  (Mr. KILEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KILEY. Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's Department of 
Labor has announced a new independent contractor rule that is a full-
fledged assault on the right to earn a living in America.
  It is estimated that this new rule will cost between 3.2 and 3.6 
million American jobs, and this is not a matter of speculation. We have 
seen the devastating impact of the law that this rule was based upon, 
AB5 in California. A new study shows that this law in California led to 
a 10 percent decline in self-employment and a 4 percent decline in 
overall employment.
  These are just numbers, though. What is really important to 
understand is the stories of folks who have lost everything because of 
AB5 in California.
  This is from Daniel who said: I am a chiropractor in California. I 
was just terminated from my wonderful independent contract, 10-hour-
per-week job. The company cited AB5. I have had this job for 10 years. 
The job allowed me flexibility to take care of my three special-needs 
kids. Now, it is gone.
  To prevent millions of Americans from suffering the same fate as 
Daniel, I am sponsoring legislation under the Congressional Review Act 
to nullify this new rule from the Department of Labor, and I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reclaim the policymaking 
authority of Congress in this area.

             CHAMPION OF THE WEEK DETECTIVE LARRY RHODABACK

  (Mrs. SYKES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. SYKES. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Akron Police 
Detective Larry Rhodaback as the Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th 
Congressional District.
  Detective Rhodaback has worked for the Akron Police Department for 22 
years and was working a secondary job in an apartment building when a 
23-month-old girl went unconscious.
  Detective Rhodaback immediately jumped into action and instructed the 
child's father to put the toddler on the table so he could perform CPR 
while the child's father called 911 for help. His lifesaving rescue 
efforts continued until emergency medical services crews arrived at the 
scene and the young girl was able to be transported to Akron Children's 
Hospital.
  Detective Rhodaback reacted without hesitation to provide the 
necessary care the child needed to stay alive until more help could 
arrive. I thank Detective Larry Rhodaback for his heroic service to our 
community and his dedication to keeping members of our community safe.

  Mr. JAMES. Madam Speaker, while we often recognize noteworthy and 
acclaimed personalities, we have so many other great, unsung heroes and 
amazing souls who do a ton of heavy lifting with little to no 
recognition. Yet, if truth be told, they serve as the glue, sturdiness, 
strength, and all that is good about America. They go about their jobs 
quietly, without having the expectation of recognition. In fact, they 
do what they do because it is God's work, it is the right thing to do.
  I am privileged to be in a position where I can acknowledge one such 
unsung hero who happens to be the grand matriarch of my family. Born 
February 14, 1929, to William E. and Lillie Mae Ward, she is my 
grandmother, Ms. Annie Ruth Nicks. In a few days, we are blessed to 
celebrate her 95th birthday.
  I am standing here on the shoulders of giants, her shoulders, four 
generations removed from slavery, because my grandmother has always 
covered me in prayer, has always had my back when I needed her the 
most, and because she didn't kill me as a child when I put a hole in 
her wall, flung applesauce on her ceiling, and played with matches too 
close to the house in the Mississippi summertime. I thank my Grandma 
and wish her a happy birthday.

                         HONORING JOHN HAYWARD

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize John Hayward, a 
lifelong

[[Page H521]]

resident, family man, community leader, and dear friend who passed 
January 27 at age 86.
  After attending the Old West End's Rosary Cathedral and then 
graduating from Central Catholic High School, where he was senior class 
president, John later graduated from the University of Notre Dame. He 
was then commissioned for duty as a naval navigator aboard the USS 
Independence.
  Later, after graduating from Georgetown Law School, John returned to 
Toledo to practice law with his father and to serve as assistant Lucas 
County prosecutor. He became special counsel on the Kent State 
University cases and then a founding partner in the firm Hayward, 
Cooper, Straub, Walinski & Cramer. In 1981, he joined Shumaker, Loop & 
Kendrick to specialize in healthcare law.
  At 67, John so-called retired from law to become president of Mercy 
College in Toledo.
  John chaired the board of the Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, as 
well as the Toledo and Ohio State Bar Associations.
  After the death of his wife, Mary Beth, he found love again and 
married Jeanie Hayward in 2005.
  To Jeanie and their precious blended family, we extend heartfelt 
condolences and gratitude for the life of John Franklin Hayward. May 
his spirit continue to inspire a new generation of leaders in all walks 
of life.
  Madam Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record the names of 
John's family members, and I thank America for his beautiful life.

       Also surviving are his sisters, Kristi Brewer of Columbus, 
     and Sally (Charles) Marlowe of Toledo; brother, Richard 
     (Patricia) of Toronto, Ontario; children, John P. Hayward 
     (Patricia McCormick) of Perrysburg, Thomas Hayward (Tom 
     Wright) of Lexington, Kentucky, Bridget (John) Kahle of 
     Columbus, and Ethan (Melinda) Hayward of Waterford, Michigan; 
     stepchildren, Michael Bugert (Angie) of Toledo, Kristi 
     DelVerne (James) of Toledo, Gretchen Williams (Ryan) of Prior 
     Lake, Minnesota, and Jennifer Norman (Chad) of Mt. Pleasant, 
     South Carolina; grandchildren, Benjamin (Ashley), and Ian 
     Bonifas, Emma, Grant, and Cecily Hayward, Anna, Elizabeth, 
     and Caroline Kahle, Megan and Amelia Hayward; great

               CALLING FOR BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION REFORM

  (Ms. LEE of Nevada asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speaker, we can all agree in this House that 
our immigration system is broken, and we need a real bipartisan 
solution to protect our border and create a pathway to citizenship, 
solutions like the bipartisan Dignity Act and the bipartisan 
legislation that was negotiated in the Senate.
  Business leaders all around this country are asking for this because 
it will help build the workforce our economy needs, address worker 
shortages, strengthen supply chains, and boost our competitiveness. It 
is a win-win for businesses of all sizes and for families.
  Many of my Republican colleagues, I believe, agree with that. 
However, when they finally had the chance to do something about it, too 
many changed their mind because of none other than Donald Trump. The 
far right would rather campaign on a broken immigration system than 
actually fix a broken immigration system.
  I came to Washington to solve problems, not exploit them for cheap 
political points, and I hope my colleagues have the courage to do the 
same so we can keep people safe, boost our economy, and preserve the 
American Dream.

                  ANOTHER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FAILURE

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, roughly 18 million students fill out the 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, each year. Yet, this 
week, the Department of Education celebrated 3.6 million forms being 
submitted. That is 20 percent, a failing grade in any classroom, yet 
the Biden administration considers this success?
  Countless students and families are being negatively impacted by this 
administration's outrageously incompetent implementation of a 
bipartisan law passed more than 3 years ago.
  The Department had plenty of time to prepare for the FAFSA rollout. 
Instead, it zealously and recklessly pursued an illegal student loan 
scheme. The Department's actions have had real consequences. Students 
are hurting, especially low-income students who are most dependent on 
taxpayer aid from the Federal Government.
  The Department promises that colleges will receive financial aid 
information in mid-March. Given this Department's empty promises and 
missed deadlines throughout the past year, I won't hold my breath.

                 WISHING ALL A HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL TET

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, ``Please pray for peace,'' ``Xin kinh chao 
quy vi.'' ``Happy new year,'' ``Chuc mung nam moi.'' ``I am Lou 
Correa,'' ``Tui la Lou Correa.''
  Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize this Saturday, February 10, 
as Tet, or the Vietnamese new year.
  Orange County, my home, is also the home to the largest Vietnamese 
community outside of Vietnam. This year, Tet marks the beginning of the 
Year of the Dragon.
  This annual celebration brings families together. They cook, decorate 
their houses, and come together to celebrate Tet across Orange County. 
Orange County's Vietnamese community is an essential part of our 
county. They are entrepreneurs, teachers, soldiers, generals, and local 
leaders.
  That is why I was honored to host U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Marc 
Knapper for the first visit he has ever made to Orange County earlier 
this year.
  Madam Speaker, I wish everybody at home a happy and successful Tet.
  ``Chuc mung nam moi,'' ``Happy new year.''

                     HONORING WALTER WARREN PARKER

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of 
Walter Parker, who passed away last year at the age of 88 in 
Bloomingdale, Georgia.
  Walter was a Georgia native. He attended Savannah High School, where 
he graduated in 1954 before pursuing higher education in Virginia.
  Walter served in the U.S. Army Security Agency in Germany. After 
completing service to his country, he became a civilian employee with 
the Department of Defense. Later on, he returned to Tybee Island, where 
he owned several businesses, including The Corner, The Ice Cream Cone, 
Bill's Grill, and Reynolds Apartments.
  He also served as police commissioner for Tybee Island, and in 1985, 
he was elected mayor, where he led the city for 16 years.
  I had the honor and privilege of serving as mayor of another city and 
serving alongside Walter. He did an outstanding job.
  Walter loved many things, including playing the piano, classical 
music, and being a member of the chancel choir.
  Walter Parker was a devoted public servant who served his country 
well.

             CELEBRATING DR. ELDRED CAUSEY'S 100TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. CLYDE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
individual in Georgia's Ninth District, Dr. Eldred Causey.
  On February 11, Dr. Causey, a distinguished World War II veteran and 
the oldest living veteran in Rabun County, will celebrate his 100th 
birthday.

[[Page H522]]

  Dr. Causey's life is nothing short of extraordinary. Following the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, young Eldred knew he wanted to answer the call 
of duty. As a naval aviator, Lieutenant Junior Grade Causey 
courageously served our Nation, patrolling the Pacific Northwest 
throughout the war while stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.
  After his military service, Mr. Causey returned to the Peach State to 
attend the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia. 
He then opened his own veterinary practice in Athens and later returned 
to the university as a professor, leaving a remarkable impact on his 
students and the University of Georgia community.
  Dr. Causey's life represents a century of bravery, sacrifice, and 
dedication. As the Rabun County community celebrates Dr. Causey's major 
milestone birthday next week, I know I speak for the Ninth District in 
thanking Eldred for his honorable service and wishing him a wonderful 
100th birthday.

               REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF BURTON MILES BUNDY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I sadly rise today to acknowledge the 
loss of a friend, Burt Bundy. Burton Miles Bundy, age 82, passed 
peacefully at home in Los Molinos, California, on January 25, and will 
take a seat at the poker table with his buddies in heaven who are 
waiting for him.
  Burt was born in Santa Maria, California. In 1946, his family moved 
to a ranch in Los Molinos, California, Tehama County, where he lived 
until his last day. He was a graduate of Los Molinos High School, class 
of 1959, before attending UC Davis.
  Burt enlisted in the Air Force in 1960, and specialized as a jet 
aircraft mechanic on such planes as the F-102, F-105, and F-106. He was 
stationed at a base in Tacoma, Washington, where he met and married his 
lovely wife, Joyce McGinn, in 1962, and was then deployed to Thule, 
Greenland, before being discharged in 1963.
  In 1968, Burt and Joyce opened their feed store, Los Molinos Feed and 
Supply. They ran that business together until he was elected to the 
Tehama County Board of Supervisors in 1981.
  Burt was a leader on water, land, agriculture, and fish issues 
throughout the north State, serving as county supervisor for five 
terms. He also served as a board member on the California Farm Bureau, 
Tehama County Farm Bureau, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Regional 
Council for Rural Counties, and many others.
  Burt was a husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and friend 
to so many. He and his wife, Joyce, went to almost every Tehama County 
event--certainly every one I ever went to--and have always been willing 
to volunteer and lend a helping hand with anybody.
  He coached Little League and was an avid hunter. His special place 
was a cabin located on Mill Creek. I would frequently run into him at 
car shows where they were showing off their really nicely done 1957 
Chevy.
  Burt was a big fan of the San Francisco Giants, and we hated the 
Dodgers together. He loved to fix cars and raise cattle his whole life.
  Burt not only traveled with Joyce, but was also a graduate of the 
1998 Ag Leadership Class 29, traveling around the world talking about 
California agriculture to everybody.
  Burt spent 61 years with his wife, Joyce, and is survived by his 
sons, Lance and Justin, and five grandchildren. May God bless him and 
his family.

                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, this is African-American History 
Month, Black History Month, and we find that much of the history of 
Texas is intertwined with African-American history.
  A slave woman was called the Yellow Rose of Texas, and we realize 
that it was President Lincoln who insisted on sending General Granger 
to Texas to show the Western States that slavery was over after they 
rebuffed and refused to free the slaves west of the Mississippi.
  General Granger came on June 19, 1865, to declare that the slaves be 
made free and that States like Texas stop defying Federal law.
  It is interesting that out of that, we have been able to establish 
the first Federal holiday in 38 years, and that is Juneteenth, which 
equals freedom. Now, across the Nation, there will be States, 50 of 
them, celebrating Juneteenth on June 19.
  We have outstanding pastors that I honor today: Reverend William A. 
Lawson, Reverend F.N. Williams, Reverend Samuel Smith, and Reverend 
S.J. Gilbert.
  Of course, we honor our community colleges that are enormously 
diverse and educate mountains and many African American students.
  Texas and African-American history is better because African-American 
history is part of the history of Texas.

                FIGHTING BIDEN'S WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY

  (Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, since President Biden's first day in 
office, he has waged an unprecedented war on American energy. The cost, 
of course, is ultimately passed down to Americans.
  Let's break down a few critical missteps from the White House on 
energy policy.
  This administration has crippled U.S. energy independence, as seen by 
the administration's most recent decision to halt approvals for new 
natural gas export terminals.
  This administration has also made our country more dependent on 
foreign energy, propping up our adversaries, as seen by his decision to 
shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, which impacted many hardworking 
Wisconsinites.
  The latest push from the administration seems to be a political 
agenda against gas vehicles, which, of course, will levy even higher 
costs on Americans who cannot afford an electric vehicle.
  House Republicans, on the other hand, have remained committed to 
making energy more affordable and putting American energy first.
  We passed the Lower Energy Costs Act, which received bipartisan 
support and will put the country on a path to responsibly power our 
future.

                    INVESTING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, community colleges are 
the lifeline for eastern North Carolina, rural America, and beyond.
  North Carolina's First Congressional District is the home to 11 
community colleges that are committed to building a stronger future for 
families across the East.
  Recently, I was glad to speak with Pitt Community College President 
Dr. Lawrence Rouse at a legislative breakfast in D.C., Edgecombe 
Community College President Dr. Greg McLeod here in D.C., Halifax 
Community College President Dr. Patrena Benton Elliott on her campus, 
and College of Albemarle President Dr. Jack Bagwell in my D.C. office.
  I met with these dynamic presidents, members of the board of 
trustees, faculty, and students to learn more about how they are 
working to address industry's needs. We must invest in our community 
colleges to economically empower rural communities across America.
  Madam Speaker, I am also glad to share a special congratulations for 
Dr. Rouse on his dedicated service and retirement.

        CONGRATULATING PASQUALE T. DEON, SR., ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H523]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 
retirement of a remarkable constituent from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 
Pasquale T. Deon, Sr., who retired from the board of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority on January 25, 2024.
  Pat is the longest tenured chairman and board member in SEPTA 
history, serving the residents of greater Philadelphia since 1995. 
During his tenure at SEPTA, Chairman Deon was committed to securing 
budgetary stability for the transportation authority through the use of 
innovative financial mechanisms.
  Chairman Deon revitalized the transit authority and contributed to 22 
years of balanced budgets and the growth of SEPTA into the fifth-
largest public transportation system in the Nation.
  Moreover, Chairman Deon boasts an impressive record of bipartisan 
success for SEPTA, having worked with six Governors, five Philadelphia 
mayors, numerous county commissioners and councilmembers to secure the 
resources integral to SEPTA's continued operation and success.
  Under his leadership, Chairman Deon advocated for the development and 
implementation of new technologies that put SEPTA on the cutting edge 
of efficient public transportation, including the introduction of the 
SEPTA Key, the integration of the SEPTA control center, a centralized 
command station, and the implementation of the Positive Train Control, 
a system designed to advance and improve rail safety technologies.
  Moreover, Chairman Deon oversaw numerous technological advancements 
dedicated to making SEPTA a more sustainable system, including the 
introduction of hybrid buses into the fleet.
  SEPTA is now a committed partner of the MACH2 hydrogen hub proposal, 
a project aimed to use existing technologies to generate clean hydrogen 
energy with the goal of transitioning the SEPTA fleet to zero-emission 
by 2040.
  Madam Speaker, we congratulate Chairman Deon on his retirement and 
wish him the best in the future.

                    IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING AMERICA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Houchin). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special 
Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Utah?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, with no shortage of topics to 
discuss and cover today, the House of Representatives just recently 
passed the Protecting Health Care for all Patients Act, a crucially 
important bill. I commend the leadership of Chairwoman Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers from the Committee on Energy and Commerce to get it done today.
  I appreciate my colleagues joining me today to share their messages 
regarding the ongoing turmoil and unnecessary strain on our border due 
to President Biden's inability to get that under control, as well as 
other topics, from women's sports and beyond.
  They have come to share their messages and speak to not only America 
but their own district.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bean), a 
good colleague and friend representing the Fourth District.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman Moore for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, as I stand before you, America is being invaded.
  Right this minute, criminals, human traffickers, drug lords, and 
kingpins are taking advantage of our porous border. If that thought 
wasn't terrifying enough, hundreds of individuals on the U.S. terror 
watch list are entering our country as if we don't even have a border.
  Secretary Mayorkas is welcoming our enemies into our great Nation and 
doing it deliberately.
  Madam Speaker, I have visited our southern border twice now, and I 
can say without a shadow of a doubt it is a turnstile for crime, 
cartels, and drugs.
  Secretary Mayorkas has allowed this to happen at the direction of the 
Biden administration. He has unilaterally disarmed the border by 
refusing to enforce the existing laws and blatantly disregarding his 
oath of office, but that is not all. We know that Secretary Mayorkas 
has issued guidance stating that an illegal immigrant's presence alone 
is not grounds for deportation. Not even criminal charges or 
convictions or gang membership are enough for deportation.
  Only in crazy town can you break the law and be rewarded.
  Madam Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas doesn't want to end the mayhem at 
the border. Rather, he blatantly supports and is forcibly pushing for 
this madness. That is why there has been over--here are the numbers:
  8.3 million illegal crossings nationwide;
  Over 7 million illegal crossings at the southern border;
  1.7 million known got-aways; and
  169 terrorists caught trying to cross the border, which is an all-
time record.
  Do we know who is coming in, and do they wish to do us harm?
  That is the point, Madam Speaker. We don't know.
  What we do know is that Secretary Mayorkas has failed us all, and it 
is not just bad in Texas. From California to the free State of Florida, 
States across the country are now feeling the consequences of the 
border crisis.
  In recent days, Border Patrol's Miami sector arrested an illegal 
resident with an Interpol red notice for homicide in Nassau, Bahamas;
  An illegal immigrant convicted of attempted indecent liberties with a 
minor; and
  An illegal immigrant with over five DUI convictions.
  It is out of control, Madam Speaker.
  Florida is located more than 1,000 miles from the southern border, 
but my constituents bear the brunt of this disaster, from strains on 
our schools and healthcare systems to fentanyl on our streets and 
strains on our law enforcement.
  Planeloads of illegal immigrants are being off-loaded in our 
communities during the middle of the night at taxpayers' expense.
  Madam Speaker, the border is a fight, but it is a fight worth having. 
When it comes to the border crisis, Americans are looking for 
leadership, not denials, distractions, or deflections. It is time to 
impeach.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I can't overemphasize the point 
about fentanyl enough, and I am glad the gentleman made it again.
  That was something that was top of mind, as I just had constituent 
meetings in Utah, particularly with law enforcement, in trying to 
squelch this overabundant invasion of fentanyl. It is catching people 
in situations that they would have otherwise not gotten into. It is 
overtaking our communities, and we need to communicate about it and 
have it addressed.
  Fentanyl becomes more and more the clear topic that we need to get 
out ahead of, and I think that is something that is motivating the 
Republican Conference more than anything to address this border issue.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah, Vice Chairman 
Moore, for yielding and for claiming the time this morning to discuss 
these important issues facing our Nation.
  Madam Speaker, let me be clear. The President has the existing 
authority to close the southern border today. No act of Congress is 
necessary, no new law is needed.
  Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the 
President to, ``suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of 
aliens,'' whose entry he finds ``would be detrimental to the interests 
of the United States.''

  This is authority that has been used in the past successfully by 
previous Presidents to gain control of the border when it has lost 
control.
  His refusal to do so signals his unwillingness to secure our border, 
despite Customs and Border Protection

[[Page H524]]

reporting more than 8 million illegal encounters nationwide, including 
361 on the terror watch list since President Biden took office, in just 
3 short years.
  Let's be honest with the American people, Madam Speaker. If the 
President seriously thought an act by Congress was necessary to secure 
the border, and if he was actually willing to do so, why didn't he do 
it when Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate?
  The answer is simple. It would go against the White House's policy 
and the President's policy and desire to keep our borders open and let 
into this country millions of people illegally.
  As a candidate, President Biden made this clear. He said it multiple 
times on the campaign trail. So this isn't a policy failure. It is the 
policy of President Biden.
  Now that it is an election year and the majority of Americans believe 
the situation at the southern border is a crisis, according to at least 
recent CBS News Polls and others, President Biden is attempting to put 
a Band-Aid on what is, in my opinion, a bullet wound, and worse yet, a 
self-inflicted bullet wound.
  Except, attached to that Band-Aid, are multiple, unnecessary, and 
costly items that will only make matters at our borders worse.
  The Senate border bill isn't a border bill, it is an immigration bill 
that legitimizes President Biden's open-border policies and steals 
money from our grandchildren and great-grandchildren and relatives far 
into the future.
  On behalf of all sensible Tennesseans whom I represent, I could not 
in good faith vote for this bill in its current form. Rather, we must 
enact serious and stringent border security reforms, like the ones 
passed by the House almost 1 year ago in H.R. 2, the Secure the Border 
Act.
  New law is not needed in order to empower the President to deal with 
the problem at our southern border, but rather, to force the President 
to deal with the problem at our southern border.
  Throwing money at the problem won't solve it. Passing new laws won't 
solve it, unless the President is either forced or develops a 
willingness to enforce the laws of this country and stop the flow of 
illegal immigrants and illicit drugs into this country, his proposals 
will only make matters worse.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any 
legislation that will only memorialize or place into law the policies 
of this administration to allow illegals to flow into the country.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Rose) for his willingness to always show up and share 
his message. His constituents and Americans alike appreciate it.
  Madam Speaker, I am from Utah's First, and I call it the best 
district. I believe California is also the First District, so we will 
also call it the best district.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LaMalfa), the first best district.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Utah for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, we come to this microphone day after day, especially 
the last 2\1/2\ to 3 years, recounting the difficulty that we--``we,'' 
this collective body, the House and Senate, and the government in 
general--we are putting the people of this country through, this 
unnecessary pain, unnecessary crisis, just one after another.

                              {time}  1200

  This isn't made by weather or nature or even foreign enemies, per se. 
We are causing it by the actions either from this administration 
directly or their bureaucracy. It is one thing after another. In my 
home State of California, we echo that in spades there as well.
  One of them right now is the condition that we are treating women and 
girls in this country. Now, the usual saw might be about abortion or 
something. No, look what is happening. For girls and women in their 
sports, in their opportunities, you have men masquerading as women 
because they can't cut it on a men's team in sports, for example, so 
they switch over and just start competing on a women's team or girls' 
team in school.
  How are we even at this point of entertaining this as a legitimate 
and wise way of doing things?
  I keep asking, where are the feminist groups on this? Are they so 
locked into politics and being unified with the left that they are 
willing to sacrifice the futures of girls and young women in college 
with scholarships? Plus, the camaraderie of sports anyway, the goodness 
that comes from working as a team or those individual efforts you have 
in individual sports of excelling and finding that just dashed because 
there are a couple of biological males competing in that same sport 
with some of the built-in physical advantage they have in many sports, 
maybe not all but a lot of them.
  We see them losing opportunities for scholarships at the college 
level or winning the gold medal in whatever sport it is.
  I am glad to stand with the female athletes as they continue what has 
been a long fight to have that opportunity in sports. We have title IX 
coming along. We had some fits and starts getting there, but they 
deserve to have the same opportunities as men do.
  It is a different fight these days. What we see is the left actually 
intentionally erasing women. Their opportunities are being taken. As I 
have said, the spaces on sports teams, filling out the rosters, with 
biological males on there, they lose scholarships, or on the podium, as 
they win their medals, being replaced with biological men.
  Americans in these sports across the country are rightly outraged at 
what has happened and what is happening to women's and girls' sports. I 
have signed on to several initiatives at the congressional level to 
protect women and girls, such as the Protection of Women and Girls in 
Sports Act that keeps men from taking scholarships, roster spots, and 
championship titles from women athletes.
  Indeed, it is a point of insanity where we are with this. It is 
really unfair that they would have to even fight for this opportunity 
to compete on a stage, on a field, or what have you, with biological 
men; be pitted against them in contact sports, possibly physically 
harmed due to the physical advantages that are frequent, or the 
indignity of having to share a locker room space the way you are 
raised, with modesty, with the obvious separation of the sexes--up 
until this recent phenomena that seems to be having so much momentum 
amongst the left, amongst people who it seems like have really lost 
their sensibilities.
  This is an effective silencing of the voices of female athletes, with 
the expectation to conform, all because of a gender identity ideology 
that is running amuck right now. Indeed, we are kind of a laughingstock 
as a country from some of the countries that are still developing their 
own sports and contemplating what the heck is it they are doing over 
there.
  Women are being directly hurt by this, as I mentioned, with the 
physical harm, concussions, skull fractures, other injuries, and being 
pushed out of their opportunities by this intrusion of males.
  It is imperative for the next generation of girls that they be able 
to grow up and know that they are cared about, that they are loved, 
that they matter, instead of just being erased from these 
opportunities. It is just unbelievable we have to talk about this.
  Indeed, under this Biden era and others, my home State of California 
and several other States that are doing this, it is one crisis after 
another.
  I want to talk about energy for a minute, too, because that is 
another unneeded crisis that is being inflicted upon the people of this 
country due to the cost.
  Now, energy is the basis for so much of our economy and the cost of 
our economy. In my real life, I am a farmer. Before the 2022 crop, we 
saw the price of fuel double and the price of fertilizer triple. In 
2023 it came back down a little bit. In my home State of California, it 
is still often normal to see $5 fuel out on the roadway there. It is 
all because the day President Biden came in, he started having an anti-
American energy policy, which is harming our ability to develop and 
transport natural gas, which is very important, for example, in 
fertilizer production, but also in warming grain storage around the 
country, putting warm air on the grain so it will dry out and stay 
preserved, and so many other forms of use of natural gas, heating homes 
and operating power plants.

[[Page H525]]

  With the miracle of hydraulic fracturing developed not that long ago, 
America came from being an energy user to the ability to be a major 
energy exporter. The prices came down so much that other countries were 
actually looking at locating more and more factories here because the 
cost of energy was going to be so low.
  We have the Biden administration doing everything it can to cut off 
more development and usage of natural gas at the pass. Why is that? 
Natural gas burns cleanly. It is one of the good transition fuels as we 
move from other forms to that, but we still need all of them. We need 
all of them.
  Hydroelectric power is clean, CO<inf>2</inf>-free electricity, yet it 
is being pushed out as more and more dams--in my own district in 
northern California, four dams on the Klamath River are being attacked 
right now. One of them has already been taken down. Ostensibly, the 
idea is to save fish there, even though the fish historically really 
haven't traveled up the river the way it is claimed. They aren't true 
spawning grounds in a lake that is warm, Klamath Lake, and not ideal 
for this type of fish. Science doesn't seem to matter on that, because 
it is a political situation that is being hustled on us.

  We are going to lose this hydroelectric at the same time that many 
are mandating by the year 2035 or 2045, or whatever they want to make 
up at the time, that we have to have X amount of electric cars or 
electric stoves or electric leaf blowers and lawnmowers. Heaven knows, 
we will be moving into trucks and trains and even airplanes.
  They are taking away the ability to generate electricity, clean, 
CO<inf>2</inf>-free, baseload power such as hydroelectric and really 
clean fossil fuel but still a very clean and efficient natural gas.
  I have been attending a lot of seminars on nuclear energy as well. 
There is another CO<inf>2</inf>-free power source that is baseload, 
that is dependable, that is 24/7. And we are having such difficulty 
procuring and permitting new nuclear plants. The technology has 
continued to improve and get better. For these smaller plants, it would 
be more ideal locating near cities where the technology, the safety is 
there, but we can't hardly talk about that. We have to have a 
breakthrough on that so we can be energy independent with low cost and 
what would appear to be renewable energy.
  Renewable isn't just windmills and solar panels, which are really 
unreliable. We have the opportunity to have baseload power that would 
be low priced and available 24/7 with these technologies. We have 
roadblocks time and time again. They want to tear down dams. They want 
to get rid of natural gas. They are hesitant on nuclear energy. There 
just doesn't seem to be a solution for the left, because everything is 
``no.'' It isn't all going to be served by solar panels and windmills, 
because those are a tiny percent of our overall grid.
  The rest of the world is going ahead with oil and gas development and 
usage. The curve is going way up around the rest of the world. It is 
only us and a couple other western countries that are hamstringing our 
ability to be energy independent, develop the energy we need, and have 
an economy here. Instead, we are going to export our economy to China 
and Asia.
  We are harming ourselves by having this administration in charge with 
their wrong-headed, backward policies on this. We need energy 
independence. We can do it. We can do it cleanly and responsibly.
  I mentioned CO<inf>2</inf> a couple times, CO<inf>2</inf> meaning 
climate change and the fear factor that is causing around the country. 
I remind you; CO<inf>2</inf> is only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere. 
When asked, the average person on the street who is busy with their 
lives doing what they do, they will typically guess, from all the hype, 
somewhere between 20 and 50 percent. No, it is 0.04 percent.
  With the U.S. and a couple other western countries actually 
flattening their CO<inf>2</inf> production, even dipping down a little 
bit, it is certainly not us that would be the so-called problem. It is 
the continued export of jobs, export of economy, and export of 
manufacturing to places like China and the Pacific rim where they don't 
have nearly the protections.
  As we keep talking about a carbon-free life and going zero carbon, it 
is actually not necessary. Because so little of the atmosphere is 
carbon dioxide anyway, it is not a threat. It is one that is used by 
government, by organizations, by international organizations, to try 
and control more and more of our economy and of our lives; taking away 
our vehicles, taking away our mobility, telling us we need to live in 
stacked communities instead of the way we live; running people off the 
rural areas like in my district and the western States, running people 
out of the cattle business and such by introducing wolves, decimating 
the deer and elk populations, as well as livestock; basically pushing 
people out that are productive people that serve all of those folks 
that make these policies that live in the cities.
  I guess maybe they need to go to the end of the food line when they 
are talking about what they are doing to devastate agriculture, as well 
as these other industries that provide the minerals, electricity, 
energy, and everything they need.
  There are so many crises that are unneeded in this country, I could 
go all day long, but I shouldn't. I hope people will take heart on this 
and look at what the policies are that are being made by the Biden 
administration, by Democrats in the Senate, and the majority in my home 
State of California, 3-1 Democrat majority with Governor Newsom, and 
the havoc that is being wreaked on the people of California with these 
wrongheaded policies. Certainly, I would invite the rest of the country 
not to emulate what California does.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I served on the Natural Resources 
Committee with the gentleman from California. The point that we 
continually tried to make is that American innovation and American 
leadership need to be invested in.
  The policies that are playing out and the rhetoric and all of 
hyperbole, it moves us away from improving the situation on anything 
related to energy. It is fascinating. He and I had a chance to spend a 
lot of time on that.
  To further emphasize and discuss the bill we just recently passed, 
the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, is an incredibly 
important voice within our conference, from Pennsylvania's 13th 
District, and a physician himself. I look forward to hearing his 
thoughts.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership and for holding this Special Order today.
  Mr. Speaker, it was here in the U.S. Capitol, just a few hundred feet 
from where we are standing, that President Abraham Lincoln called on 
all of us ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle.''
  Today, the House voted on legislation which will help us to carry on 
President Lincoln's promise. By passing the Protecting Health Care for 
All Patients Act, the House voted to ensure that any patient using a 
Federal health program can never be turned away on the basis of using 
the quality-adjusted life years formulas.
  Known as QALYs, these formulas have been used to determine if 
patients should receive certain medical treatments. In essence, this is 
rationing of medical care.
  As a doctor, I treated patients at the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical 
Center in Blair County, Pennsylvania. Eliminating the use of these 
formulas for all Federal programs will ensure that our veterans will be 
able to receive the care and the treatment that they need and that they 
deserve, continuing the promise of Abraham Lincoln.

                              {time}  1215

  Further, this legislation will help to protect Americans with 
disabilities and those with chronic diseases as well as children who 
receive their healthcare through Federal programs like CHIP.
  Today, I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation that protects 
patients' access to the latest medical technologies and to the latest 
innovations.
  Proudly, I can say that this legislation passed the House, and 
proudly I can say that we have voted to protect American patients.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I thank the doctor from 
Pennsylvania for his remarks. I appreciate his support on the bill and 
communicating the importance of the bill.

[[Page H526]]

  Madam Speaker, I welcome the gentleman from the Sixth District of 
Virginia to share his remarks.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the nearby State of 
Virginia (Mr. Cline).
  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this 
Special Order and for his leadership.
  Madam Speaker, I want to talk about a subject that is in the news 
right now: the crisis that has been created by this administration on 
the border and the intentional encouragement of millions of migrants to 
make a dangerous journey from across the globe to the United States. 
Crossing the border illegally, often seeking a better life, but 
declaring asylum when they have crossed the border illegally is not the 
solution.
  Yesterday, we had a vote to impeach Secretary Mayorkas. That vote 
failed by a single vote. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in 
switching his vote to be with the prevailing side, so that he can 
perform the parliamentary maneuver and bring it back for a vote when we 
do have all of the supporters of impeachment in the House Chamber ready 
to vote. Hopefully, we will see that next week.
  Madam Speaker, for over 2 years, the Biden administration has stood 
by their policies and watched as the worst border crisis in history 
continues to worsen. The results of these open-border policies speak 
for themselves. There have been over 1 million illegal migrant 
encounters since October, including 302,000 in December alone and 19 
individuals on the terrorist watch list.
  These policies have fueled a national fentanyl epidemic, put more 
money in the hands of cartels and human traffickers, opened the border 
to national security threats, and prevented ICE from deporting most of 
those here illegally, even convicted violent criminals and gang 
members.
  What is extremely tragic about this crisis that we find ourselves in 
today is that most of this could have been prevented. The Biden 
administration assumed office with strong border security policies in 
place, and, yet, instead of taking responsibility and maintaining sound 
policies that would fix these issues and enforce our immigration laws, 
President Biden and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro 
Mayorkas, dismantled our border security.
  We have given this administration all the tools that they need to do 
their job and secure the border. There are laws on the books that 
basically spell out exactly how to secure the border, how to detain 
those coming across the border illegally, and how to prevent those from 
coming across the border illegally, but this administration has 
actively worked to find every loophole and do just the opposite.
  We, all 435 Members of this body, swore to defend the Constitution, 
yet the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, who took a similar 
oath, has the audacity to come before Congress, the Judiciary Committee 
on which I am proud to serve, and lie under oath saying that we have 
operational control of the border. Secretary Mayorkas has the audacity 
to neglect his oath to safeguard the American people and our community, 
and this body must hold him accountable.
  It is our duty to hold those accountable who neglect their duty, 
regardless of their position. Secretary Mayorkas has purposely and 
knowingly disregarded the rights and security of this country's 
citizens and failed in his responsibility to protect our homeland.
  The American people rightfully deserve action. It is imperative that 
we, as Representatives of the people, ensure that those in positions of 
power are held to the highest standards of accountability. That is why 
I will continue to fight on behalf of my constituents, whom I am proud 
to serve every day, to continue to ensure their safety and hold 
Alejandro Mayorkas accountable for his dereliction of duty.
  It is long past time we restore our Nation's rule of law and 
sovereignty. We must impeach Secretary Mayorkas, and it is my hope that 
we do so next week. The American people deserve better.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia 
for sharing his perspective from his district just west of here. I 
think that is the point. A lot of folks come up and use this time to 
share a message in speaking to their constituents, but across the 
country this impacts everywhere. We use the terminology that every 
State is a border State, but it does impact everywhere.
  Madam Speaker, again, we passed a very important healthcare bill 
today. Healthcare policy is oftentimes misunderstood and difficult to 
really communicate. That has continued on for decades.
  I want to highlight some of the aspects of this bill that we just 
recently passed out of the House of Representatives. Before doing so, I 
wanted to use this moment to also highlight something that I have done 
from this podium before on why this moment, when we talk about all the 
crises that are going on--we have major turmoil going on in the Middle 
East, we have a border crisis, and we have inflation running rampant--
in all of these different areas, I want the American people to know my 
perspective.
  I want my constituents to know that right now the political reality 
is that we have what is called split government. We have a White House 
with a Democratic President and a Democratic Party. We have a 
Senate controlled by the Democratic Party, and we have a House of 
Representatives controlled by the Republican Party.

  What the Republicans in the House of Representatives have been trying 
to do for just over the year that we have had as the majority--for a 
time we were in the minority--is to just highlight several different 
things.
  Let me speak very plainly. The American Rescue Plan was passed 
several weeks after President Biden was inaugurated. What took place 
then was everything switched in Washington. When we have a split 
government like we do now, we usually, hopefully, get outcomes like we 
did with the tax package last week where Republicans and Democrats on 
committee sat down, looked through the entire Tax Code and realized 
that certain provisions had expired. They tried to uncover what the 
important aspects were of what we needed to accomplish.
  We came to an amazing tax package that I have celebrated. I have 
celebrated along with my committee members; I have celebrated along 
with the entire House of Representatives and back home. I am so proud 
of the work that we did there. Oftentimes that is what creates a lot of 
really good results.
  Returning to the American Rescue Plan, it was a $1.9 trillion bill 
that within months created some of the worst inflation our Nation has 
seen in four decades. It is simple. When we add that much monetary 
supply and we have too much money chasing too few goods, then there is 
only one equation, and it is inflation.
  When the Republicans took over the House of Representatives this last 
cycle, it is being reported all the time now that inflation is sort of 
squashed. These are simple equations. Republicans are putting the 
clamps on what President Biden tried to massively spend during his time 
when he had the White House, the House, and the Senate, because in that 
scenario, Madam Speaker, you don't have to even dialogue with the other 
party. I am proud of the work that Republicans have done in that 
scenario.
  So I use that as an example. That is a simple equation. It is basic 
economic fundamentals. If we don't load up the monetary supply so much 
then you won't create this type of inflation, and we have been doing 
that. Prices are still high because a lot of these prices are here to 
stay, unfortunately. After a massive inflationary period, those prices 
stay high, but inflation is down. I am thrilled to have been a part of 
it and to be able to put the clamps on the Biden administration's 
spending appetite and get this back to a reasonable level.
  The point that I am trying to draw a correlation on is we have been 
hitting this border issue for 3 years now, and we are going to continue 
to do this. It is now clear from all of the data and all of the 
polling--colleagues of mine from the Democratic side recognize that 
this isn't just a post-pandemic issue where we are overloaded on the 
border--we have a fundamental issue.
  The thing that I am appreciative of on my side is just highlighting 
very specific and simple things that could be done to fix this. I wish 
we could do it legislatively, but they don't even need to be done 
legislatively. They are

[[Page H527]]

simple things like re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols or the 
remain in Mexico policy. This is the strongest signal to the cartels 
that says: You can't overrun our borders because through this asylum 
process, you will get put in the system, you will get a spot and you 
will get your case heard, but you are not allowed to be released.
  It is the most simple and basic policy. If President Biden wanted to 
truly effect positive change at the border, then he would just re-
implement things like the catch and release program. There are simple 
fixes to that, and I have highlighted it over and over again. I will 
continue to do that and to call this out. Hopefully, we can.
  Even going forward, it is a tumultuous time in the House of 
Representatives and in the Senate right now about figuring out where to 
land on some of these negotiations. We cannot give up just because 
things seem difficult or overwhelming. We have got to be willing to 
find a way to massively improve our situation at the southern border.
  Again, back to the legislation that we covered today and that we 
recently passed. This is another step to improve our healthcare system 
and ensure all patients get access to the best treatments and care that 
they need.
  Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers' Protecting Health Care for All 
Patients Act will help ensure the value of lifesaving cures and 
treatments for people with disabilities is not discounted.
  The bill will provide all Federal healthcare programs, including the 
VA and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as well as federally 
funded State healthcare programs like Medicaid, from using prices that 
are based on quality-adjusted life years or similar measures. Quality-
adjusted life years are intended to measure the value of medical 
interventions relative to someone's condition and how it will impact 
the patient's longevity.
  Nonetheless, this can devalue certain patients' lives and lead to 
picking winners and losers, ultimately taking the decision out of the 
hands of patients and their healthcare provider. A ban on quality-
adjusted life years currently only applies in Medicare, so by extending 
this prohibition to all Federal payers, we show people with 
disabilities and chronic illnesses that we value and cherish their 
lives and their ability to get the care they need.
  This is particularly important in Medicaid and the VA. Medicaid 
serves a large population of people with disabilities, and the VA, as 
we know, cares for injured veterans and those with service-related 
disabilities like the brave men and women who serve at Hill Air Force 
Base in Utah's First Congressional District.
  This policy also protects the ability of payers to use utilization 
management tools and other measures to determine cost effectiveness to 
keep our healthcare costs down, so long as those measures are not 
discriminatory.
  The Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act is widely supported 
by leading advocacy organizations that support vulnerable patients with 
chronic diseases or people with disabilities ranging from The ALS 
Association, to Autism Speaks, to the National Down Syndrome Society 
among many, many others.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Rodgers for her passion for these 
issues. I urge the Senate to take this up and to seriously consider it, 
not to look on party lines, and pass this legislation. There is merit 
to this, and it will go and serve vulnerable populations.
  Again, Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for being willing to come 
and share their message. I appreciate their willingness to always come 
and do this and be a part of our Special Order.
  I will end with just saying there are simple fixes to a lot of this, 
and we cannot continue to make it so difficult.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                      BLACK HISTORY MONTH OVERVIEW

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Michigan?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, each year in February, we have the 
opportunity to study the past and use it as a learning tool to move 
closer to a future of social equity for all. As we are now in the midst 
of Black History Month, it is both fitting and necessary that we look 
inward to our own communities and the legacy of the pioneers who paved 
the way.
  From the foundations of our great State to the present time, 
Michigan's Seventh District, which I am proud to represent, has been 
home to many pioneering Black men, women, and organizations who have 
made significant contributions to every aspect of life in our State.

                              {time}  1230

  The great State of Michigan stood tall as an anti-slavery State in 
the Civil War and played an important role in aiding Freedom Seekers on 
their path via the Underground Railroad.
  Today, Michigan is a hub of arts, culture, athletics, and innovation, 
thanks to the contributions of our diverse citizenry who call it home.
  It is my profound honor, for the fourth time annually, to highlight 
stories of Black Michiganders, past and present, from the Seventh 
District and to read their stories into the archives of this great 
Chamber.


                       Honoring the Canady Family

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to a legendary 
Lansing family that has broken barriers across generations and 
continues to make history to this very day.
  The story begins in 1927 when the family matriarch, Ms. Hortense 
Canady, was born in Chicago. While she didn't grow up in Michigan, she 
came to Michigan State University to pursue her graduate studies after 
attending Fisk University, where she met her husband, Clinton.
  In the Lansing area, Hortense and Clinton, a World War II veteran and 
member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, settled, put down roots, and left 
an indelible mark on our community.
  Clinton became a well-known and well-loved dentist, while Hortense 
put her passion for education and civil rights into action, becoming 
the first African American elected to the Lansing School Board of 
Education in 1968. Four years later, she and several other board 
members were recalled for advocating for desegregation, but Hortense 
did not let that deter her from working toward her core belief that 
everyone deserves access to quality education.
  She sat on the State's Women's Commission, served as the first 
executive director of the Lansing Community College Foundation, and 
helped fund a debutante club in Lansing to fill a void for young Black 
women, who at the time were not permitted to share in this tradition.
  Hortense founded the Lansing alumnae chapter of her sorority, Delta 
Sigma Theta, and served as its national president from 1983 to 1988. 
She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2002 and was 
named one of Ebony magazine's Most Influential People. Hortense Canady 
died in 2010 at the age of 83.
  Not only was Hortense Canady impressive in her own right, but her 
children have continued to blaze their own trails.
  Her daughter, Alexa Canady, is the first African-American woman in 
the Nation to be a neurosurgeon and served as the chief of neurosurgery 
at the Children's Hospital of Michigan from 1987 until her retirement 
in 2001. She devoted her brilliant mind and numerous talents to healing 
and welfare for thousands of young patients over the course of her 
career. Like her mother, she was inducted into the Michigan Women's 
Hall of Fame. She was also named a Michigander of the Year by the 
Detroit News in 2002.
  All three of Hortense Canady's sons became attorneys, including the 
Honorable Judge Clinton Canady III. Before ascending to the bench, 
Canady

[[Page H528]]

practiced law for 37 years. He was a founder of the Lansing Black 
Lawyers' Association, director of the Ingham County Bar Association, a 
commissioner for the Lansing Board of Water and Light, a member of the 
NAACP, and served on the board of the Lansing Symphony Association, 
Central Michigan Legal Aid, and so many other organizations.
  Elected to the Ingham County Circuit Court in 2010, Judge Canady 
served through his retirement in 2022 but returned on assignment to 
help address the backlog of cases during the COVID pandemic.
  He and his wife, Rita, have two children who are continuing the 
Canady tradition of service, one as an administrative law judge in 
California and the other at the United States Department of State.
  The Canady family is part of the very fabric of the Lansing 
community, a fabric stitched with their incredible work ethic and 
commitment to breaking new ground and to clearing a path for others to 
follow.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that their accomplishments be forever enshrined 
in the permanent Record of the United States House of Representatives.


                     honoring elsie mcpherson-brown

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I honor the groundbreaking service 
of a Livingston County woman who never even planned to live in the 
area, much less to make history there. Fortunately, life had its own 
plans for Elsie McPherson-Brown, and the community is so much better 
for it.
  Livingston County sits at the crossroads of several major highways, 
and when Elsie McPherson-Brown was driving one of them to go visit 
family and friends, she took a wrong turn and ended up in the northern 
community of Hartland, Michigan.
  Elsie liked what she saw on that unexpected outing. After further 
investigation, including meeting with the superintendent and school 
principals, she convinced her husband to relocate to Hartland from 
Detroit with their two elementary school-aged boys.
  It is worth noting that Livingston County was and is to this day an 
overwhelmingly White community, but Elsie and her family were 
undeterred. From the beginning of their time in Hartland, Elsie dove 
into community service, volunteering in her kids' classrooms, chairing 
teacher appreciation day events, and serving on the PTO.
  In 2003, Elsie took her service to a new and historic level when she 
successfully ran for the Board of Education of Hartland Consolidated 
Schools, becoming the first African-American woman and only the second 
African American in modern history to be elected to public office in 
Livingston County.
  Her story is not without challenges, particularly when it comes to 
race relations. She often shares how a grocery store manager insisted 
her personal check was fraudulent because he refused to believe that a 
Black woman was living in Livingston County at the address that was 
stated. There were local police officers who questioned her youngest 
son and refused to believe he was heading home for the same reason.
  Elsie chose to rise above and set her focus and her intention on the 
things that she loved about the community and the commonalities she 
shared with her friends and neighbors.
  Supported by the voters, Elsie served 10 years on the school board 
and fulfilled her goal of having a voice and shaping the education of 
the next generation.
  She was known for her calm demeanor, her colorful outfits, and the 
many hats she wore about town, perhaps representative of the different 
hats she wore in life: wife, mother, advocate, trailblazer.
  While she has stepped down from public office, today she continues 
her life of quiet service to the community in her work in the 
Livingston County Sheriff's Office.
  Elsie McPherson-Brown may have stumbled upon Hartland accidentally, 
but it is no accident that she changed the course of Hartland's 
history.
  Madam Speaker, her story deserves to be told, uplifted, and forever 
preserved here in the permanent Record of the people's House.


                  honoring dr. samuel edward holloway

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I honor a man who was a trailblazer 
in athletics and education and used his talents to break barriers and 
change the lives of generations of young people.
  Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway lived to serve others: his Nation, his 
community, and his family. It is fitting that as we mark Black History 
Month, we shine a light on his place in the history of Michigan's 
Seventh District and the many doors he opened for others to pass 
through.
  Before he was Dr. Holloway, he was simply Sam. He was a young man who 
came to Michigan with his father and left the Deep South as part of the 
Great Migration north.
  After spending his childhood in various parts of the Midwest, Sam and 
his family settled in Michigan in the 1940s, where he would eventually 
join the Ann Arbor High School class of 1951.
  Sam's athletic abilities were evident from a very young age. He was 
crowned State champion in his wrestling class during his high school 
years. Also clear was his desire to use his life for the greater good 
as he enlisted in the United States Army upon graduation and was 
honorably discharged in 1953.
  It was then that Sam began embarking on what would become his 
lifelong calling: public education. He received his bachelor's and 
master's degrees from Eastern Michigan University, during which time he 
also began his teaching career.
  So it was, at the height of the civil rights movement in 1963, when 
Samuel Edward Holloway became the first Black faculty member in the 
history of South Lyon Public Schools. During his tenure there, he was 
credited with becoming the first Black person to serve as head 
wrestling coach for any high school team in the State of Michigan.
  Eventually, Sam earned his Ph.D. in education and went on to serve in 
numerous districts, including Ypsilanti Public Schools and Romulus 
Public Schools.
  In the late 1970s, he became a building administrator at Pioneer High 
School in Ann Arbor, a full-circle moment for a man who had graduated 
from that very district.
  He held that post until his retirement in 1990, a retirement that he 
and his wife, Janet, enjoyed to the fullest. Still an athlete at heart 
and in practice, Holloway competed each year in the Arizona Senior 
Olympics and rode his motorcycle across the United States and Europe.
  Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway passed away in 2022, leaving behind his 
devoted wife, his four children, a large and loving extended family, 
and an incredible legacy.
  Dr. Holloway didn't set out to be a pioneer. He simply wanted to do 
the things he loved in service to others.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that the permanent Record of the people's House 
reflect his groundbreaking contributions and the gratitude of the 
institutions forever changed by his presence.


                    Honoring Orrin and Luvina Wilson

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to two of the most 
beloved residents to ever call the St. Johns, Michigan, community home: 
Orrin and Luvina Wilson.
  Settling in Clinton County post-Civil War, the Wilsons were a ``power 
couple'' before the term existed, but it was never about seeking power 
for themselves. Rather, the Wilsons lived their lives in quiet but 
devoted and groundbreaking service to their Nation and to their 
neighbors, and forever changed the face of St. Johns.
  Orrin was just 16 years old in 1864 when he enlisted in Michigan's 
all-Black regiment, the 102nd United States Colored Infantry, Company 
K, out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. He served until the war's end and 
returned to Michigan, where he met and married his bride.
  The two would soon settle in St. Johns, where they lived for the next 
60 years. In addition to his military service, Orrin was a trailblazer 
in so many ways.
  First, he took up the trade of barbering and owned his shop for 
nearly 50 years, serving a mostly White clientele out of the old Steel 
Hotel in downtown St. Johns.
  He was also a founding member of the local chapter of the Grand Army 
of the Republic, a national union of Civil War veterans, and served as 
its post commander for a time. Not only was he the only Black member of 
the St. Johns Charles Grisson Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, 
it is believed that he is the only Black man in

[[Page H529]]

the State of Michigan to hold such a leadership position outside of the 
all-Black posts in cities like Detroit.
  Luvina was a trailblazer in her own right, serving as president of 
the local chapter of the Women's Relief Corps, an auxiliary 
organization of the Grand Army of the Republic. The WRC not only 
supported the mission to aid Union veterans but also assisted former 
Army nurses and promoted patriotism through education. Just like her 
husband, Luvina is believed to be the only Black woman in the State to 
have ever led an all-White post.
  Orrin and Luvina raised their two sons together, George and Arthur, 
who continued the family barbering trade. The family was active in St. 
Johns United Methodist Church, where Orrin served as a trustee and 
treasurer for three decades. They were married for 58 years, linked by 
their common goal of creating a better, more just community and Nation.

  United, they also were in death, leaving this world just 1 day apart 
in late December 1928. The two were buried together in the veterans 
section of the Mt. Rest Cemetery, with flags flown at half-mast and a 
large funeral procession going past the family home on South Clinton 
Avenue.
  Madam Speaker, may their life story and memory be a blessing and an 
inspiration to all of us, forever preserved here in the permanent 
Record of the people's House.


                         Honoring Mike Garland

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I pay tribute to a basketball coaching 
legend who helped lead the Michigan State University Spartans men's 
basketball team to 19 NCAA tournaments, 10 Big Ten championships, 7 
Final Fours, and a national championship.
  As impressive as those statistics are, former MSU Assistant Coach 
Mike Garland quite literally came back from the dead and is now using 
his second chance at life to pay this incredible gift forward.
  As much as Mike Garland loved coaching basketball, and as many great 
things as his teams accomplished on the court, he was content with his 
decision to retire from MSU in June 2022. He was looking forward to 
spending more time with his wife, his kids, and his grandkids.
  Not long after, however, he went into cardiac arrest while driving 
his car. Fortunately, two Good Samaritans were driving by at the time. 
They saw Garland's car go off the road and into a tree. They called 911 
and performed CPR until paramedics and police arrived. In total, 13 
people worked on Garland for an agonizing 18 minutes to restart his 
heart.
  It turned out the electrical failure in Garland's heart was the 
result of a birth defect, one that required open heart surgery to fix. 
Three months later, Garland was back up and running, quite literally, 
on the treadmill. Not long after that, he honored all of those who 
helped save his life with an emotional public thank-you at the MSU 
Breslin Center, home to many of his greatest coaching moments.

                              {time}  1245

  Today, the Breslin Center is also home court for his new passion: a 
foundation he launched called Champions of the Heart.
  Through this nonprofit, Garland works to inform the Spartan community 
and others on how to save lives during episodes of cardiac arrest.
  Attendees at these free trainings learn how to perform CPR, how to 
recognize sudden cardiac arrest, and how to use an automatic external 
defibrillator.
  Mike Garland is a man who has lived two lives, both defined by 
statistics. In the first, his focus was on wins, losses, and free-throw 
percentages.
  His second life, however, is summed up in a single stark numerical 
reality: Only one person in ten survives a cardiac arrest.
  For all he has done to defy the odds and change the course of history 
for himself and for others, I ask that his story be recorded in the 
permanent Record of the people's House.


                 Recognizing Reverend Lillian Archibald

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a woman who defied not 
only the odds but her own family's wishes to become a pioneer in the 
pulpit at a landmark Black church in Livingston County, Michigan.
  Though her father was a devout Baptist preacher in the early part of 
the 20th century, Lillian Archibald was taught from a young age that 
ministry was strictly for men. The fourth of five children, Lillian's 
father was clear in his message to his daughters: Love the Lord, but 
find another calling of work.
  Skeptical but obedient, Lillian attended a business college in her 
hometown of Memphis and spent time as a missionary before starting a 
family of her own. Tragically, the youngest of her four children was 
killed in 1977 in a crash between a car and a train.
  Despite her profound grief, Lillian took solace in her unshakable 
faith and made the decision that it was time to answer the call that 
had been placed upon her heart.
  Lillian enrolled at Payne Theological Seminary and enlisted in the 
ministry at age 50. She spent some time as an itinerant elder before 
being ordained as a full minister in 1985. And, of course, she broke 
the news to her father, who she says grew very quiet before finally 
giving his blessing.
  She brought that blessing to Michigan, first serving 6 years 
assisting the pastor at a church in Jackson, Michigan, before being 
assigned to pastor St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church in 
Brighton--the only African-American church in predominantly White 
Livingston County in 1990.
  With her melodic voice and charismatic style, Reverend Archibald is 
credited with breathing new life and hope into her congregation where 
she stayed for 4 years.
  During her tenure, the church grew in size and in spirit, and began 
reaching out to the community and joining other churches with a sense 
of common purpose and passion.
  Though her time in Livingston County was brief, her impact was 
profound. She received numerous recognitions for her commitment to 
community, including her work with victims of domestic violence at the 
Women's Resource Center in Howell and her efforts to shelter the 
unhoused through Habitat for Humanity.
  Perhaps one of her greatest gifts was the mentorship she offered to 
other women contemplating the ministry. Reverend Archibald is still 
warmly remembered today by many of them as a compassionate guide and a 
listening ear.
  Just as her courageous ministry and her golden voice still guide the 
work of St. James AME Church, I ask that her memory be forever 
enshrined in the permanent Record of the United States House of 
Representatives.


               Honoring Rodney Whitaker and Xavier Davis

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to two members of the 
Michigan State University faculty who have contributed to the rich 
artistic landscape of our great State and helped shape the next 
generation of musical talent, all set to a distinctive jazz beat.
  As a young recording artist in Detroit, Rodney Whitaker likely never 
imagined he would one day build and lead one of the most distinguished 
jazz degree programs and performing faculties in the world. But the 
legendary bassist known for his distinctive ``bear-sized'' tones, today 
serves as director of jazz studies at MSU, a program he has transformed 
into a world-class training ground whose students have gone on to 
perform alongside some of the top jazz artists in the world.
  It is a case of those who can do, teach. Whitaker himself spent 7 
years as a bassist with Wynton Marsalis' Septet and the Lincoln Center 
Jazz Orchestra, followed by a quarter-century touring around the world, 
collaborating and performing with legendary jazz artists from Dizzy 
Gillespie to Diana Krall.
  He continues to teach master classes at universities around the 
world, all while serving as the artistic director at the MSU Professors 
of Jazz, the East Lansing Summer Solstice Jazz Festival, the Dr. 
Phillips Center Jazz Orchestra in Orlando, Florida, and the Gathering 
Orchestra in Detroit to name a few of his many involvements.
  He has earned one of the highest distinctions in academia, the title 
of University Distinguished Professor of Jazz Bass and he is proud to 
serve as a special assistant to the dean's office, directing the 
College of Music's diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging efforts.
  In 2006, he was nominated for the Juno Award, Canada's equivalent to

[[Page H530]]

the Grammy, and in 2011, he received an Emmy nomination.
  Just last year, he was named 2023 Detroit Jazz Hero by the Jazz 
Journalists Association.
  But strip away all the titles, all the awards, and Whitaker is simply 
a man who understands the power of the gift that he has been given and 
the necessity to pass it on. In his own words, Dr. Rodney Whitaker 
said: That is my truth. I love passing on the knowledge of the 
history of music, and it is life-changing to see that lightbulb go off 
in someone. It certainly changed my life.

  For all the lives he has enriched, changed, and set to music, I ask 
that his contributions forever live here in the permanent Record of the 
United States House of Representatives.
  Madam Speaker, I would also like to shine a light on the incredible 
accomplishments of another member of the Michigan State University jazz 
community: Associate professor of jazz piano, Xavier Davis.
  It was 1994 and Xavier Davis, then a college student from Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, was performing with a small ensemble at a convention 
in Boston when his tunes caught the ear of the legendary jazz vocalist 
Betty Carter, a native of Flint, Michigan. Carter scooped him up and 
brought him to New York, hiring him to work exclusively as a pianist 
for her jazz trio.
  Davis spent many years in New York, cultivating his talent, learning 
from and playing with some of the greatest names in jazz, including: 
Carl Allen, James Williams, Billy Hart, Regina Carter, and Wynton 
Marsalis. He served as musical director for the Boys Choir of Harlem 
during its 1999-2000 season, he played keyboard for the television 
series ``The Cosby Show,'' and has been featured on more than 50 
albums, including a Grammy-winning collaboration with Christian McBride 
in 2012.
  We are so fortunate that after 6 years of teaching at the famed 
Juilliard School in New York, Davis brought his talents back home and 
has been teaching jazz piano at Michigan State University since 2014.
  In addition to the many students who have benefited from his 
instruction, Davis has also dedicated himself to uplifting his own 
hometown of Detroit through his music.
  Supported by a grant from Michigan State University's Humanities and 
Art Research program, Davis began composing music about Detroit, which 
eventually became a powerful album titled ``Rise Up Detroit.''
  Through his music, Davis focused on the role Detroit has played in 
the lives of African Americans and in the world at large, highlighting 
the Underground Railroad, the Great Migration, and the boon days of the 
auto industry.
  Professor Davis is a gifted composer, arranger, and producer of 
music, and widely recognized as one of the most accomplished jazz 
pianists in the world. He is also a proud Michigander, continually 
giving back to the community and the State that put the music in his 
soul. While he is a recording artist, it is my distinct pleasure to 
record his accomplishments and convey my gratitude for his 
contributions here in the permanent Record of the people's House.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

    OUR GREATEST EXISTENTIAL THREAT RIGHT NOW IS THE BORDER PROBLEM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LaMalfa) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, indeed, I spoke a little earlier about 
how we seem to have hopped from self-made crisis to self-made crisis in 
this Chamber, in this Capitol, in this town, whether it is by 
legislative action, executive action, or bureaucratic action, but what 
the American people are suffering from most is government caused.
  It really isn't a condition of weather or nature or even so much our 
adversaries around the world--and those are all factors and they all 
can be factors--but they pale compared to crises that are, indeed, 
caused by the actions of the government in Washington, D.C., in my home 
State, and so many of them right there in Sacramento.
  We are talking energy. We are talking fiscal. We are talking a 
business climate that is hampered by unreasonable regulations. We are 
talking about things as simple as women and girls' sports. Why should 
that be complicated? Yet it is.
  And the one that is probably the most difficult and the greatest 
existential threat right now to our country immediately is the border 
problem. This porous border has been made that way pretty much since 
day two of the Biden administration. It certainly wasn't perfect before 
that, but my hat's off to President Trump in his term for trying as 
much as he can to do something about it, by building the wall, 
continuing to build the wall, repair old sections of the wall. He met 
resistance just about every step of the way.
  Indeed that infrastructure makes it so much easier and simpler for 
our border personnel to be able to track who is coming across the 
border and basically funnel them to the areas where border entry can be 
properly processed with a plan in place, with rules in place, with laws 
in place that would make that expedient and actually beneficial to our 
country, and also less harmful to those that would wish to come here, 
to immigrate here, to seek jobs, to seek citizenship, what have you.
  In an orderly society, we need to have control of the border and 
invite people to come be part of what this country has to offer. That 
is what immigration used to be many decades ago. It slipped away from 
us.
  We hear all day long, oh, the immigration system is broken. Well, it 
is broken because it is not being enforced. Now, we could add to the 
laws that we have in the books there and refine them, such as the 
interpretation of asylum which is wide open these days. Asylum used to 
be more reserved for people that were being subject to abuse by a 
regime in the country they lived in. They would be subject to much 
persecution, religious persecution, political persecution, what have 
you.
  We understand that. We saw that in World War II and pre-World War II 
in Europe with what happened to the Jews there. The United States 
didn't act quickly enough in that situation, but at least we understand 
what asylum should look like. What we have now is basically people 
presenting themselves at the border, if they are not just sneaking 
right past, and saying a few magic words to the personnel and then they 
are taken into custody temporarily, given a number and maybe even a 
fictitious name, and allowed to move on through.
  I have been to that border. I have witnessed what that looks like. 
Indeed, we have buses going back and forth patrolling the border not to 
keep the border closed or enforced, but picking people up so they can 
sooner get them to processing centers. We are paying for that. It is 
like a giant welcome wagon that has been turned into such by this Biden 
administration.
  Now President Trump, as I said, tried really hard to get a handle on 
this, and improvements were made with several hundred miles of new, 
strong border fence and repaired old fence. Also, the border personnel 
felt like we appreciated them. We appreciated their jobs. We 
appreciated the effort they are making.
  Nowadays, I think they are just completely overwhelmed, and I can't 
imagine the morale is very good when they are basically told that they 
are to be part of running the welcome wagon and just letting people in. 
We hear anecdotes about them welding the gates open where they are, 
actually in Texas. Are you kidding me?
  The State of Texas through their own National Guard has been making 
efforts to control parts of their border there, putting up wire and 
other measures that will help control some distance on their border.

                              {time}  1300

  You have the Biden administration threatening them and bringing 
lawsuits against them, and who knows, maybe even a confrontation with 
Federal troops versus Texas National Guard at some point in order for 
the Federal Government to be tearing down the barrier in order to 
preserve our border and have some semblance of order instead of the 
chaos that has been introduced and exacerbated by the Biden 
administration.
  How does this make a lick of sense to anybody, to tear down the 
barrier that,

[[Page H531]]

indeed, the Federal Government should have built up to begin with?
  Now, let's talk about the barrier itself a little bit. We are not a 
country that is going to completely close it off. We welcome legal 
immigration. I shouldn't have to say that. It has always been who we 
are. Legal immigration, one that goes through process, one that our own 
people, our own government decides how many people we want to have 
enter under the different programs, under the different categories, how 
many should we have this year apply for citizenship.
  That number is way up from what it was five, six decades ago where I 
believe the stats are somewhere around 800,000 or 900,000 new legal 
immigrants, new citizens per year as I think I have it, whereas the 
number might have been around 200,000 back 50 or 60 years ago. It is a 
dramatic increase of us welcoming legal citizens over that time.
  Others that would apply for work permits, education visas, travel 
visas, different categories. All we ask is that you follow a set of 
rules. Go through a process. That is not unreasonable.
  I always liken it to when you leave your home, most likely you 
probably lock your doors on your house. Maybe you even set an alarm. 
Maybe you have a fence around your house, your property. Is it because 
you hate your neighbors, because you hate somebody else that might come 
by? No, it is because it is your security, it is your responsibility.
  There are people who are going to be led into temptation. Look how 
many packages get stolen off front porches because the deliverer just 
leaves it there. I guess that is the agreement. That is rampant these 
days. What if that door was unlocked? The same people who are bold 
enough to steal packages off your front porch wouldn't have any 
hesitation to go inside and clean you out at well.
  Look what they are doing to retail stores while clerks and employees 
helplessly watch them cart off phones and watches and whatever other 
merchandise they can get while their corporate edict is don't dare talk 
to them, don't follow them with a camera, don't get their license 
plate. Heaven knows you wouldn't want to try to detain them in any way, 
as we see more and more of the corporate world become spineless in 
controlling the chaos.
  We see this affecting mostly our very large cities, which politically 
tend to be the blue cities, Democrat-controlled mayors and city 
councils, supervisors, like that. They have chaos like hasn't ever been 
seen in this country when you talk about crisis. Part of this is soft 
on crime, part of it is soft on border, soft on what they call 
immigration. This isn't immigration, it is an invasion.
  Immigration would imply that there is a legal process to it. Again, 
we still welcome legal immigration to this country. We always have. 
That is the part that gets caught up in the blatant misinformation 
placed out there, because Republicans want to have order. They want to 
have something that will preserve the sovereignty of this country and 
preserve all the infrastructure within it.
  I mean, when you look at the cities here, take New York City, where 
they are filling up community centers and school rooms and gyms and 
national parks with--they use the term ``migrants.'' A migrant is a 
euphemism. This is an illegal immigrant invasion. They are getting 
angry because people are bussing them in from Texas, Florida, and 
wherever else. The border States are overloaded. California, which I 
represent a part of, is one of those border States along with Arizona, 
New Mexico, and Texas. Truly, though, it ends up pretty much all of our 
States in effect are border States because you have the Biden 
administration flying these folks around the country and placing them 
wherever they see fit.
  It is interesting to see. They squawk about maybe the Governor of 
Texas and Florida and some others bussing them to their city where they 
proclaim they are a sanctuary city, we welcome you, we want you to come 
in, as the Governor of New York and the mayor of New York City have 
claimed in the past, and then are backtracking on now because the 
numbers have finally caught up to them even though they have been 
warned and warned and warned by those of us who can see what that is 
going to look like.
  Why do we put in place people who allow a system like this to happen, 
to foster a system that is so, indeed, broken as it is? We have the 
laws. We have the rules, and we even passed in this House a good piece 
of legislation, H.R. 2, to refine those rules.
  You hear people saying: Oh, you Republicans are full of hooey on that 
because you say, on the one hand, enforce the laws you have, but on the 
other, why do you want this new law to come in? Well, because they are 
not doing the job. Asylum needs to be refined, it looks like.
  Now, if you had a different administration that was on the side of 
the American people and on the side of enforcing the law, you could 
probably interpret asylum as it was originally intended, for those who 
indeed are facing a crisis due to an oppressive government.
  However, no, it has been interpreted to be just pretty much wide 
open. Our border is a sieve. When I visited the border, you see people 
coming through a coyote process or paying people big money, otherwise 
their lives might be harmed by the coyote system they have down there, 
the cartels.
  I saw pretty nice people coming across. There were families and such 
like that. These aren't bad people at heart. They are breaking the law, 
but when you leave a great big green light there saying come on in, I 
guess I can't blame them, but the people you are talking about aren't 
necessarily persecuted by a government in such fashion but, more, they 
are seeking economic opportunity. Nine out of ten or more are seeking 
economic opportunity, seeking a job, seeking the promise.

  You hear the Democrats, you hear people in the media saying: All they 
want is to come and seek a better life. Well, sure, but the life of 
this country, the lives of the citizens who are already here, those who 
came here legally, came here properly, and those who have been here, 
born here as citizens, they are paying the freight on all this because 
you are bringing folks in who haven't been brought up in the American 
way, haven't been educated in our ways, probably don't speak the 
language in many, many cases, may not even have a skill to bring so 
that they can self-sustain themselves and their family.
  It will be maybe low-skilled labor that probably won't pay their own 
way. That is chaotic, and that is not how our immigration system used 
to work. One hundred years ago, however many decades ago, you had to 
offer something that is going to strengthen our country to be an 
immigrant here.
  Now, again, we will hear, oh, that is so closed minded, it is so 
oppressive and so hateful because that is the only play they have. They 
keep going to the well on that, call it xenophobia or racism or 
whatever. No, the greatness of this country is in its process, in its 
Constitution, in its stability and people who respect that and uphold 
that, uphold the Constitution, uphold the laws.
  The lawlessness we are seeing at the border, as untold numbers are 
coming across daily, I am glad to see this idea that was coming from 
the Senate on an immigration bill has pretty much lost any momentum 
because, at a minimum, according to the pieces I am reading on it, 
5,000 people would be allowed across the border per day before they 
take any action on it.
  Now, let's say you are a retailer, all right? You are seeing all the 
break-ins and the rip-offs and the looting going on. What if you had a 
rule in your city that said we have to let five thieves in per day to 
your retail center and they can fill up their bags as much as they 
want, but on the sixth one we will go ahead and start enforcing on it. 
We will call the police, detain, whatever.
  What kind of crazy idea is that, as well as so many other holes that 
are in this package?
  The first place we start: enforce the border, finish building the 
fence so that our border personnel are not so overwhelmed and put them 
back to their real jobs of not just processing people as fast as they 
can and turning them loose in our country, which maybe they will show 
up for an asylum hearing in 8 or 10 years and become so entrenched in 
the country illegally that you can't find them or you can't deport them 
if you wanted to. That is part of

[[Page H532]]

it. That is part of the chaos that is being fostered.
  Where I represent in California, which indeed is a border State, I 
represent the north end of it, which is about 600 miles from the border 
itself, but we see the secondary effects of illegal immigration, it 
keeps growing. When I say ``grow,'' it is literal because what we have 
in part of my district and some of the southern California districts as 
well is a proliferation of illegal marijuana grows, many, many acres of 
them.
  There are hundreds of greenhouses that our rural counties are just 
overwhelmed trying to deal with. There has been a passive response by 
the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the 
Biden administration, and our own California administration led by 
Governor Newsom with soft-on-crime policies.
  This changes the landscape of a rural community, having all these 
marijuana grows and the cartels and all the filth that comes with 
that--the environmental damage, the people who are abused. Sometimes 
even slave labor is involved with people captive out there because 
nobody knows who they are, where they are, let alone having a permit to 
build these facilities or take the water from somewhere else in order 
to have the marijuana grow.
  Today's marijuana, which is a much more powerful product, brings with 
it the whole litany of gang activity as this product is moved up and 
down, in my area, say, Interstate 5, but all over the West, all over 
the country even.
  Illegal immigration has a lot of side effects. The marijuana 
proliferation, as I mentioned, of course the fentanyl is coming across 
the border and infecting and destroying so many lives. It goes on and 
on and on because this administration and our own Governor in 
California, that administration, continue to foster this lawlessness, 
soft-on-crime, soft-on-border policy that is doing us so much damage 
and is probably the biggest problem we face along with our massive 
deficit and the crunch that is coming from that.
  I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) to talk more 
about that. I greatly respect him and the work he has done on this area 
on the border. He has been very diligent on putting this out in front 
of the people and pointing out what a crisis this is to our country and 
its existence.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. A 
week ago, I stood at this microphone and talked about five stories that 
I think the mainstream press has left uncovered or undercovered. I 
always felt that under our Constitution, we have three branches of 
government. Now we are in a lot of trouble. When I think of the three 
branches of government, I think which one would disappoint our 
forefathers the most. I think it would be the judiciary, which doesn't 
have an adequate respect for the U.S. Constitution.
  Our Constitution also presupposed an active press corps doing a good 
job of informing the public of the issues of the day. I don't think 
these issues have been adequately covered. One more time, I would just 
like to touch upon what I believe are five key issues that have been in 
the news but undercovered by the press.
  The first one is what is going on at our border. In December, we hit 
a new all-time high of the number of people crossing the border and 
staying in this country. That was 370,000. Sometimes the press and for 
whatever reason some of my colleagues talk about the number of contacts 
with Border Patrol. They do not talk about the number of people let in 
the country. The 370,000 is easily the highest amount we have had in a 
month. By point of reference under the prior administration, the number 
let in per month in the final year would vary from 5,000 to 20,000 
people a month.

                              {time}  1315

  We are now increasing by a factor of about 18 to 1, and it creates 
the biggest threat to the future of our Republic that is out there.
  In addition to the 370,000 people crossing the border, all of which 
will be schooled here, all of which, as promised in his election bid, 
will receive free medical care. By the way, I should point out that 
many Americans don't get free medical care. They are either uninsured 
or have $20,000 deductibles.
  No, our President has promised the new immigrants here free, 
unlimited healthcare. With those people come, depending on the month, 
8,000 to 10,000 unaccompanied minors.
  We do not allow 7- or 8-year-olds to wander around the country if 
they are born here. We are now getting, depending on the month, 800 to 
1,000 unaccompanied minors, obviously a recipe for human trafficking, 
obviously a recipe for being mistreated, being allowed to work in 
factories all hours.
  The administration has not done anywhere near an adequate job of 
keeping track of these folks and where they are.
  They have intentionally said they are not going to be giving out DNA 
tests so that if somebody wants to be a sponsor and claims to be an 
uncle for little Missy, we have no idea whether that is true or not.
  Depending upon who is doing the counting, we have lost somewhere 
between 30,000 and 80,000 of these unaccompanied minors somewhere in 
the country.
  For a press corps that in the past had concerns about families being 
broken up, that only happened for a couple of weeks at a time and only 
when it was absolutely necessary. Here we have tens of thousands of 
young children without either parent, possibly never seeing them again.
  It is a story that ought to be talked about, and there ought to be 
graphs on the front page of every newspaper in the country that we are 
now letting in 370,000 people.
  It should also be more accurately covered the number of people who 
are dying of preventable overdoses in narcotics. We are over 100,000 a 
year.
  I am old enough to remember the Vietnam war, where there was great 
concern as we lost 57,000 American servicemen over 12 years. Madam 
Speaker, 57,000 American servicemen over 12 years--over 100,000 people 
killed every year by illegal drugs crossing our southern border.
  I think the mainstream media ought to do more to point this out. If 
people die in a murder, if people die in a car accident, it always 
makes the local pages.
  This is far more than the number of murders plus car accidents every 
year, and we ought to do a better job of educating the public about the 
number of people dying in any individual county. That is an 
underreported story and will result in the end of America.
  We do report that there is currently a war going on between Hamas and 
Israel, and it has been reported that that war was started 100 percent 
by Hamas, which stormed across the border, raping women, cutting the 
heads off of little children, killing over a thousand people.
  I think some members of the American public believe the reason this 
war began is that, in some fashion, Palestinians were being mistreated 
by being adjacent to Israel. This is not true at all, and it has been 
underreported what a potentially good situation one had prior to this 
war if one lived in Gaza.
  During the initial horrific invasion, some people may have noticed 
that some of the people killed were from Thailand. Other people may 
have noticed that some of the people who were held hostage were from 
Thailand. I don't think the mainstream media has done a good job of 
explaining why that was. It is because if you lived in Gaza or near 
Gaza, there were all sorts of good jobs that were made available by 
being at or near Israel.
  It recently appeared in the paper that up to 25,000 people from 
Ecuador wanted to move to Israel to take these jobs. These jobs are 
better jobs than almost anywhere else in the Arab world. Indeed, why 
would people from Ecuador or people from Thailand come from halfway 
around the world to live in Israel? Because it is a wonderful place to 
live; people are well paid; and even though you are leaving your family 
behind, it is a highly desirable life.
  I think if one considers the number of people from other parts around 
the world who are coming to Israel to work, one would realize that the 
case that Hamas has made to society as a whole, that they were a put-
upon minority, disappears. It shows 100 percent of the sympathy in the 
current conflict or the beginning of the conflict should stand with 
Israel.
  Israel right now is looking to put forth agreements with other 
countries

[[Page H533]]

of people who want to come and take jobs, many of which used to be 
taken by Palestinians. People from the Philippines and people from 
Vietnam are also going to be coming to Israel because of the huge 
economic progress that is made by the Jews in Israel as they have taken 
a land that was considered almost entirely a wasteland 60 years ago and 
turned it into one of the most modern countries in the world.
  I will also point out that Israel is a very tolerant country. In Gaza 
itself, run by the Palestinians, they would not have any Jewish 
temples. In Israel proper, there are over 400 Muslim mosques, which 
operate and are allowed to operate by the Israeli Government.
  I think if we are going to educate the American public about what is 
going on in this Hamas-Israel war, we have to let the American public 
know how many people wish they could come to Israel to work.
  The next issue--and I talk to people about this all the time when I 
go back home, and we will talk about it again--is the attitude of the 
new head of the Joint Chiefs, General Brown, toward his diversity 
initiative.
  Now, traditionally, America has gotten where it is by being a 
meritocracy, and people advance whether they are good or bad. Of all 
the parts of society, the part of society that had better never cease 
to be number one is our American military.
  Nevertheless, the head of the Joint Chiefs has publicly said he wants 
to reduce the number of White male officers from something in the 60 
percents down to, I believe, 42 percent, 44 or 42 percent.

  Again, this is a fundamental change in the way the military has 
naturally done things. They want to operate like a little second-rate 
community college in which they are more concerned about race or where 
people's great-great-grandparents were born than about making sure we 
have the right person for the job.
  I think this is something that should be discussed more, even though 
General Brown has been confirmed, and finding out what exactly is being 
done in achieving this goal.
  On a subcommittee that I am fortunate enough to chair, we had a 
hearing on this topic. We found out that there is a perception, which 
probably is true, that people who are White are treated poorly. As a 
result, we are not meeting our recruiting goals because White people 
are realizing, perhaps accurately, that they are going to have a hard 
time in the military.
  When it comes time to be promoted, they are going to be viewed 
hostilely. I think that is something we must look at more.
  The next thing to talk about is that we have tax credits that are 
benefiting the wealthiest developers in our society. We are expanding 
the use of those credits under the tax bill that I voted for because of 
other good provisions and the tax law passed a couple of weeks ago.
  I personally think the low-income section 42 tax credits are the 
worst in the tax code. They give money to well-heeled developers. They 
are allowed to have 70 percent of their building paid for by the 
government, a lavish subsidy in which the already wealthy members of 
society become wealthier still.
  Finally, I would mention the prayer breakfast we had a week ago, 
which is something else that has been understated. We will talk about 
that next week.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

 CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WIDESPREAD 
 HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A DEEPENING 
  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE IN AFGHANISTAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
                  UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-105)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to the widespread 
humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for a deepening 
economic collapse in Afghanistan declared in Executive Order 14064 of 
February 11, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond February 11, 2024.
  The widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan--including the 
urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, 
livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, and shelter 
and settlement assistance, among other basic human needs--and the 
potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States. In addition, the preservation of 
certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States 
by United States financial institutions is of the utmost importance to 
addressing this national emergency and the welfare of the people of 
Afghanistan. Various parties, including representatives of victims of 
terrorism, have asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB 
or indicated in public court filings an intent to make such claims. 
This property is blocked under Executive Order 14064.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14064 with respect to 
the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for 
a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, February 7, 2024.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE SITUATION IN 
  AND IN RELATION TO BURMA--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
                      STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-106)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in 
and in relation to Burma declared in Executive Order 14014 of February 
10, 2021, is to continue in effect beyond February 10, 2024.
  The situation in and in relation to Burma, and in particular the 
February 1, 2021 coup, in which the military overthrew the 
democratically elected civilian government of Burma and unjustly 
arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights 
defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, thereby rejecting the 
will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November 
2020 and undermining the country's democratic transition and rule of 
law, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 14014 with respect to Burma.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
                                     The White House, February 7, 2024.

  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, restore us to Your favor. You are our rock and 
salvation, our shelter in life's storms. Thank You that Your anger is

lives. Though weeping may endure for a night, because of Your favor, 
joy comes in the morning.
  Lord, surround our lawmakers with the shield of Your divine favor. 
May no weapon formed against them prosper. Bless them when they are on 
the road, when they are going to bed, and when they are getting up.
  Hasten the day when, because of Your favor, justice will roll down 
like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.
  We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 815, 
which the clerk will report.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 30, H.R. 815, to amend 
     title 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements 
     relating to the eligibility of veterans to receive

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.


                                H.R. 815

  Mr. SCHUMER. First, happy birthday, Mr. President. Have a good one. I 
hope we all have a good one today.
  All right. Today, Mr. President, Senators face a decision several 
months in the making: Will Senate Republicans vote to start debate--
just a debate--on bipartisan legislation to strengthen America's 
security, stand with Ukraine, and fix our border or will they cower to 
Donald Trump's orders to kill this bill? Will the Senate stand up to 
brutish thugs like Vladimir Putin and reassure our friends abroad that 
America will never abandon them in their hour of need? Will Republicans 
take ``yes'' for an answer and seize the best opportunity--the best 
opportunity--that Congress has seen in decades to secure our border? 
This is the choice Republicans face today. They can either choose what 
is good for the country's national interest or they can choose what is 
good, at least in their minds, for Donald Trump.
  I have always believed the Senate works best when we take the 
bipartisan path. Not everything is perfect in this bill, but I see it 
as my job to let bipartisanship take hold whenever possible, and this 
bill reflects that. But all week long, Senate Republicans have looked 
more and more like their House counterparts and transformed themselves 
into the chaos caucus. Republicans have said they can't pass Ukraine 
without border. Now they say they can't pass Ukraine with border. So, 
today, I am giving them a choice. They can show America where they 
stand and what they stand for. Which way will it be?
  Today, I have laid out both options for Republicans to do the right 
thing. Democrats certainly want to fix the border. It is extremely 
important, and we have shown our willingness time and time again to 
take big steps to secure the border, but we will move forward today 
with either option.

[[Page S428]]

  First, I have scheduled a vote on the supplemental that includes 
strong bipartisan border reforms that Republicans have demanded for 
months. Negotiators on both sides worked themselves to the bone putting 
this border package together. I was heavily involved. I saw the work--
the blood, the sweat, the tears--that went into it. Why did we do it? 
Because that is what Republicans wanted. They said: Can't do Ukraine, 
can't do Israel, can't do humanitarian aid without border.
  I made sure negotiators had enough time to do their work. I gave them 
the space to keep going, even when it seemed like a deal was out of 
reach, because, again, Democrats want to secure the border because it 
is extremely important. It is urgent. It can't wait. We must act. We 
are ready to move forward on this bill now.
  Today, when we vote, it will be clear as day who is serious about 
fixing the border and who is not. I urge Republicans to take ``yes'' 
for an answer.
  If Republicans block this national security package with border 
legislation that they demanded, later today, I will give them the 
opportunity to move forward with a package without border reforms. This 
package will otherwise be largely the same. It will have strong funding 
for Ukraine, funding for Israel, help for innocent civilians in Gaza, 
and funding to the Indo-Pacific.
  The legislation on the floor today is one of the most important 
security packages the Senate has considered in a very long time. So the 
onus is on Senate Republicans to finally take ``yes'' for an answer.
  It would be an embarrassment for our country--an absolute nightmare 
for the Republican Party--if they reject national security funding 
twice in one day. Today is the day for Republicans to do the right 
thing when it comes to our national security.
  Now, it must be----
  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, would my friend from New York yield----
  Mr. SCHUMER. No, I will not.
  Mr. WICKER.--just for a question about----
  Mr. SCHUMER. Not now. I am in the middle of my speech.
  Now, Mr. President, it must be said that the 180-turn Republicans 
have done on border is one of the most stunning things I have seen 
Congress in a long, long time do. The damage Republicans have done this 
week to their credibility cannot be understated.
  After all, how many times have we heard our Republicans colleagues 
give speeches here on the floor about the emergency at the border? How 
many times have we heard Republicans say, year after year, that 
Congress must act, that legislation is the only long-term solution? 
They have said that: Legislation is the way we have to go.
  How many times have we seen Republicans take field trips down to the 
border, like Eagle Pass or Laredo, and take pictures with the fence 
towering behind them, while bemoaning that the problem at the border is 
only getting worse?
  Apparently, that was all for show. Apparently, Republicans aren't 
actually serious about fixing the border, because you cannot--you 
cannot--claim to be serious about fixing the border while voting 
against the kind of border package we have before us today. You cannot 
claim to truly care about fixing asylum if you are going to vote 
against the biggest updates to asylum law in decades.
  You cannot claim to care about our Border Patrol agents while 
depriving them of the very tools and funding they are asking for. 
Remember, the union of Border Patrol agents--a very conservative, 
almost always pro-Republican group--wants us to pass this bill.
  Why are we doing all of this? Why are they going to kill, in one fell 
swoop, this agreement that has taken months to piece together?
  The answer--why are the Republicans doing all of this? Why have they 
backed off on border when they know it is the right thing to do? Two 
words: Donald Trump.
  Donald Trump doesn't like that the Senate finally reached a real 
bipartisan border deal. So he has demanded Republicans kill it. Let me 
say that again because it is as plain as could be. Donald Trump doesn't 
like that the Senate finally reached a bipartisan border deal. So he 
has demanded Republicans kill it. He thinks it is far better to keep 
the border in chaos so he can exploit it for personal political great 
gains.
  Senate Republicans--vertebrae nowhere to be found--are ready to 
blunder away our best chance of fixing the border in order to elevate 
what they see as the interests of Donald Trump above the interests of 
the country.
  I expected this kind of cynical nonsense from the far-right House 
MAGA Republicans, but it is shameful and embarrassing to see MAGA 
radicalism take hold here in the Senate.
  No matter how today shapes out, I hope Republicans end up doing the 
right thing when it comes to national security, before the day is done, 
and agree to move forward on those things they do support, because if 
there is one other person besides Donald Trump who is rooting for chaos 
in the Senate, it is Vladimir Putin.
  If we fail in this moment, if we abandon our friends in Ukraine to 
Vladimir Putin, history will cast a shameful and permanent shadow on 
Senators who block funding. It is a matter of the highest national 
urgency that we get this right.
  Remember what Putin said 2 months ago about American aid to Ukraine:

       [T]he free stuff is going to run out some day, and it seems 
     it already has.

  That is Vladimir Putin taunting the Senate, taunting America. We have 
a chance today to make him regret those words.
  Republicans of decades past would have never hesitated to support 
funding for nations like Ukraine. In previous generations, both parties 
would have bent Heaven and Earth to stand up to Russian dictators. I 
can hear Ronald Reagan giving a speech passionately asking the Senate 
to vote for aid to Ukraine. We spent half a century safeguarding the 
free world against the malicious spread of communism, against tyranny, 
against those who have tried to undermine our values.
  Those very same issues--of Western democracy, of the sovereignty of 
free nations, of the safety of our troops and our citizens--are on the 
line yet again in the 21st century. They are the very things that 
stitch this supplemental together. It is why we are here with this bill 
before us in the first place.
  There is only one right answer for the Senate today to address the 
great challenges we face. There is only one path forward to fulfill our 
obligations to the American people. There is only one way Senators--
Democrats and Republicans, both sides of the aisle--should vote today, 
and that is for us to move forward on the package of national security.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader would 
yield for a question on schedule?
  Mr. SCHUMER. No questions.
  Mr. WICKER. Well, may I say something on just this quick point, Mr. 
President? My question to the Democratic leader was about the way he 
intends to proceed.
  Obviously, he has counted the votes, as we have on this side, and the 
package with the border provision will not pass. Then he intends to 
move to a package that does not contain the border provision.
  My question to the distinguished leader would have been: Does he 
intend to negotiate an amendment process where Members from both sides 
of the aisle would be able to propose changes in the legislation? And 
how will that affect when we go forward and when we are able to deal 
with these important issues that he has advocated for so vigorously? 
Those would have been my questions, and I think the American people and 
the Senate deserve an answer on how we are going to proceed, and will 
there be an open process of amendments?
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after listening to the majority leader's 
comments, I think it is worth taking 5 minutes to recall how we got 
here.
  You know, it is ironic to me that people give speeches here on the 
floor of the Senate about their support for Israel. And there is no 
doubt Israel is involved in an existential fight with Iran and Iranian 
proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, and the Shia 
militias in Syria and Iraq.
  But the House passed an Israel aid package on November 2. Israel was 
attacked October 7. The House acted on

[[Page S429]]

November 2, and the majority leader, who is the only one who can 
schedule a vote on anything here on the Senate floor, has done nothing 
to help our best ally and friend in the Middle East, the State of 
Israel--nothing.
  He has insisted that we package together aid to Ukraine, aid to the 
Indo-Pacific. And there have been endless discussions about a border 
bill, which I will come to in a moment. But this problem that we are 
running into is one of his own creation.
  He could decide to take up these bills individually, knowing that the 
House has already passed an Israel aid bill, and then have the Senate 
take it up and pass that bill. Then we can turn to the other issues 
that are vitally important to our national security and deserve fulsome 
debate and an open amendment process.
  That is the question my friend from Mississippi was trying to ask the 
majority leader, but he decided to leave the floor without responding 
to that, giving me some doubt as to the sincerity of his commitment to 
have an open amendment process and actually restore the Senate to its 
previously held reputation as the world's greatest deliberative body. 
Nobody can call us that now with a straight face.
  I understand that the majority leader is trying the best he can to 
help the Republican Party. He gives advice freely as to what 
Republicans should do. But the fact of the matter is, we have no 
confidence--zero confidence--that the Biden administration will enforce 
the law when it comes to the border. That has been the case for the 
last 3 years, resulting in historically high numbers--300,000 people a 
month--showing up at the border, only to be ushered into the interior 
by Biden open-border policies that either people claim asylum and are 
released into the interior, perhaps never to be heard from again, or 
they are released on parole.
  Catch-and-release is the policy of the Biden administration and 
congressional Democrats. That has proven to be a powerful magnet for 
illegal immigration--people literally coming from all around the world 
because they know they can make it into the country because President 
Biden and Senate Democrats have laid out the welcome mat.
  So you will have to forgive me when I note the fake outrage, the 
phony messaging that we hear from Democrats about this border 
negotiation. Yes, it is true that we hoped to come up with something 
credible. On our side of the aisle, Senator Lankford from Oklahoma has 
done a heroic and a thankless job of trying to come up with a 
negotiated package. But the fact of the matter is, the package includes 
catch-and-release still, providing additional or continued incentives 
for people to come to the country illegally, knowing they will be 
released into the interior; and it does nothing to stop the Biden 
administration from abusing something called parole, which means that, 
in order to avoid bad press, in order to avoid embarrassing TV pictures 
of an overwhelmed border, they simply just release people into the 
interior of the country for 2 years and give them a work permit.
  Are you kidding me? They now claim to be the defenders of the border 
and for border security? What a joke. What a joke. And it is a bad 
joke.
  We know, as a result, the Biden border policy, supported day in and 
day out by our Democratic colleagues for the entire time that President 
Biden has been in office, has resulted in roughly 7 million migrants 
being released into the interior of the United States, and 1.7 million 
``got-aways''--what the Border Patrol calls them, people evading law 
enforcement, for good reason, I suspect. Either they are transporting 
illegal drugs into the interior of the United States or, maybe, just 
maybe, out of that 1.7 million, there are a few people who are on the 
Terrorist Watchlist.
  We know the Border Patrol has detained roughly 170--I think, at last 
count--people on the Terrorist Watchlist. That is the people they know 
about. But they can't tell us how many more people on the Terrorist 
Watchlist are among those ``got-aways,'' endangering the safety and 
security of the United States.
  It took 19 people to kill 3,000 Americans on 9/11. What about 1.7 
million ``got-aways''? We don't know whether these are serial 
criminals. We don't know whether they are transporting drugs. We don't 
know whether they are terrorists. We don't know anything about them, 
and, frankly, President Biden doesn't care--and neither do our Senate 
colleagues who have done zero--nothing, nada--to deal with this 
problem. So you will have to forgive me if I find their fake outrage 
unconvincing.
  And then there are the 108,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses 
last year. That is also part of the Biden open border policies. I have 
been wearing since April of last year a rubber bracelet given to me by 
a father of a young woman who lost her life because she took a pill 
that she thought was relatively innocuous but was laced with fentanyl. 
Her name was Sienna. Her father asked me to wear this rubber bracelet 
that says: ``One pill can kill.''
  Well, 71,000 Americans died last year as a result of fentanyl 
poisoning, including young women like Sienna, who took something they 
thought was relatively innocuous, which was a counterfeit pill laced 
with fentanyl--and not waking up the next morning.
  And then perhaps the greatest untold story--we tried to tell the 
story, and the New York Times has written about this--is the hundreds 
of thousands of unaccompanied children who have been placed with 
sponsors in the interior of the United States who have come across the 
border. They have been attracted like a magnet to our border and under 
Biden policy have been released to sponsors, many of whom aren't even 
immediate relatives.
  And the Biden administration has simply lost track of them. They 
can't tell you whether the 300,000 children are going to school, 
whether they are getting the healthcare they need, whether they are 
being trafficked for sex, whether they are being forced into 
involuntary labor. The New York Times has written at least two times 
that I recall about forced labor conditions for these migrant 
children--forced into illegal, dangerous labor.
  And the New York Times tried to call some of these sponsors to see if 
they knew about what these children were doing, these children who were 
turned over to the care of these sponsors by the Biden administration 
under their current policies. In 85,000 cases--85,000 cases--there was 
no answer.
  So the truth is, under the Biden border policies, under the policies 
supported by all of our Democratic colleagues--now who are 
demonstrating fake outrage about the failure of the current border 
bill--they simply don't care. They don't care about these children. 
They don't care about the families grieving lost loved ones as a result 
of the illegal drugs that stream across the border, carried by the very 
criminal organizations that smuggle people from around the world who 
show up at our border and are released into the interior of the United 
States.
  What greater incentive can you think of for attracting illegal 
immigration than the open border policies which, tragically, result in 
the death of innocent Americans, including innocent children, losing 
300,000 children placed with sponsors? The Biden administration doesn't 
care.
  So let me just say that when the majority leader takes off his hat as 
the majority leader of this great institution and puts on his hat as a 
Democratic partisan making political attacks against the very people he 
is hoping will support the legislation that he is advocating for--aid 
to Ukraine--this is not a good day for this institution. And it strikes 
me as a bizarre tactic when you know who the hundred people are who are 
going to be voting on the legislation that he is going to put on the 
floor.
  And the fact that the majority leader walks away from a legitimate 
question by our colleague the Senator from Mississippi who asked 
whether there will be an opportunity for debate and votes on 
amendments--he won't even answer the question. This is the same 
majority leader who put this bill on the floor that we will be voting 
on at 1 o'clock and said, ``OK, we released the text,'' on Sunday night 
and that in 72 hours Senators are going to have to vote on it.
  These are detailed, complex negotiations that have been taking place 
for months now, and the majority leader won't even give the Senate and 
Senators time to digest it and understand

[[Page S430]]

it. I think that tells you all you need to know about his motives. This 
is all about partisan political attacks and posturing leading up to the 
November 2024 election.
  President Biden is guilty of some of the same posturing. He said--
this is rich--after Secretary Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, has said time and time again under oath, ``The border is 
secure''--well, we knew that was a lie because our eyes did not deceive 
us. We could see what was happening at the border. We could listen to 
Mayor Adams in New York City, the mayor of Chicago, Governors around 
the country, saying: We are being inundated by migrants coming across 
the border. And in the case of Mayor Adams, he said it is going to 
destroy New York City, even though they are a self-designated sanctuary 
city.
  Well, all of that has fallen on deaf ears for the last 3 years, and 
the Senate majority leader and the President of the United States think 
that the American people are so dumb that they haven't seen what has 
been going on the last 3 years. They have resisted every single effort 
on our part to secure the border, to halt this tsunami of illegal 
immigration and illegal drugs. They have resisted all of it.
  And now the majority leader would have you believe that he has had a 
conversion. This is Saul on the road to Damascus. But I don't believe 
it, and I don't believe the American people will believe it because 
their common sense, their very eyes and ears tell them something 
different, and that is that the Biden administration, Democrats in the 
Senate, and the Senate majority leader who came out here crying 
crocodile tears over the failure of the border negotiation--they know 
it is not true. The American people will not be deceived by this 
transparent political pitch suggesting that now they are the champions 
of border security.

  The President of the United States has every tool he needs--every 
tool he needs--to secure the border. The laws that are in effect now 
are the same laws that were in effect when President Trump was in 
office, and the numbers were dramatically different. In fact, President 
Biden's numbers of people coming across the border have exceeded the 
number that came during the entire 8 years of the Obama administration 
and the entire 4 years of the Trump administration.
  So, Mr. President, I know there are others here, including my friend 
the Republican leader, who are prepared to speak, so I will sit down. 
But I just couldn't help myself, sitting here listening to what the 
majority leader was trying to sell, which is so patently ahistorical, 
false, and is clearly just partisan political rhetoric trying to 
improve what is a very, very damaged reputation when it comes to 
dealing with our national security and the border.


                   Recognition of the Minority Leader

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is 
recognized.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 4 months ago, Senate Republicans asked 
our colleague from Oklahoma Senator Lankford to take on a pretty tall 
order: negotiate serious border security policy with an administration 
that had shown no interest in actually securing the border. He put in 
an enormous amount of work, and I am very grateful for the persistence 
he has shown over many nights, weekends, and a few holidays.
  The product he was able to secure earned the endorsement of the 
National Border Patrol Council, a sign that you are pointing in the 
right direction. But as our colleagues recognize, the agreement does 
not have a path to become law. The border crisis that President Biden 
invited through his rhetoric and his willful neglect will continue to 
challenge the brave men and women of the CPB and ICE and impact 
communities across the country, and its effects will follow his legacy 
forever.
  I wish I could say that a record-setting border crisis was the only 
challenge that the President's failures have laid before us, but our 
colleagues know as well as I do that that isn't the case. There have 
always been aggressive forces seeking to harm America and to challenge 
our interests. The very existence of a Western order in which sovereign 
nations choose their own leaders has always been an affront to 
repressive and aggressive regimes around the world.
  But even in the face of serious threats, for large portions of modern 
history, the United States has dictated the terms of engagement. For 
decades, the world's foremost superpower has been the one doing the 
deterring. Not anymore. It is no longer a settled question that America 
will meet aggression with overwhelming force or even that we will back 
our allies 100 percent.
  Take this headline about President Biden's response to the attack 
that killed three U.S. soldiers last month:

       U.S. Strikes Steer Clear of Iran's Red Lines.

  Here is the subhead of another one:

       U.S. officials acknowledge that the militias targeted still 
     retain the majority of their capability to carry out future 
     attacks.

  Oh, here is one more:

       Pentagon says it's not planning for a long-term campaign 
     [against Iran's proxies] in Iraq and Syria.

  So, Mr. President, what can the American people--and the entire 
world--gather about the Biden administration's approach to the threats 
that we face?
  First, we know that Iran is deterring America, not the other way 
around.
  Second, we know that the Commander in Chief has not yet directed the 
strongest military in the world even to exercise sufficient force 
against expendable proxy terrorists, let alone their Iranian sponsors.
  Finally, we know that the Biden administration lacks the resolve to 
defeat those who spill American blood.
  The Pentagon conceded this week they were not aware that even a 
single IRGC officer had been eliminated by their response. Yet 
administration officials say this is what sending a message of 
deterrence looks like.
  Let's be honest here. Do our allies see in this behavior an America 
that is willing to impose decisive costs on our adversaries? Do our 
adversaries, in turn, see any reason to start changing their calculus?
  In the Middle East, we already know the answer. Since the President's 
telegraphed ``response'' to the deadly Tower 22 attack, Iran-backed 
terrorists have already launched more attacks--from Iraq and Syria to 
the Red Sea. Iran and its proxies are undeterred.
  But beyond the region, is there any reason to expect that the 
President's conduct of foreign policy is causing Putin or Xi to think 
again? Not a chance. No doubt, the Commander in Chief's halting 
response to Tehran's aggression emboldens Moscow. Russian forces, like 
Iran and its proxies, were direct beneficiaries of President Biden's 
hesitation and self-deterrence as they escalated their invasion of 
Ukraine.
  Beijing--after it watched us abandon allies in Afghanistan and 
second-guess Israel's response to terrorism--has a reason to doubt that 
the United States is well-positioned to rally allies and partners to 
resist aggression in the Indo-Pacific. If America fails to stand with 
our partners on the frontlines of Europe and the Middle East, we will 
shred our credibility with friends in the Indo-Pacific.
  So today's strategic competition is more perilous. Support for our 
allies is more tenuous. And the security of U.S. personnel and 
interests is more questionable than it was 3 years ago.
  These are the circumstances in which the Senate must consider some 
weighty responsibilities of our own: to invest in the hard power that 
the President instinctively shies away from exercising, to commit to 
allies that fear being abandoned, and to address the requirements of 
long-term competition that becomes more difficult the longer America 
neglects its leading role.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after I complete my remarks, the following 
is going to be the schedule of speakers on the floor before the 
rollcall vote. It is a bipartisan agreement. I ask unanimous consent 
that following my remarks, the following Senators be permitted to speak 
prior to the scheduled vote: Senator Lankford of Oklahoma for up to 30 
minutes; Senator Murray

[[Page S431]]

of Washington, up to 10 minutes; Senator Sinema of Arizona, up to 15 
minutes; and Senator Schumer for up to 5 minutes.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the statements that were 
made this afternoon on the floor of the Senate, and there were some 
omissions of fact which need to be reminded to the people who are 
following.
  It was 4 months ago when we faced a deadline to come up with 
assistance for Ukraine. You know what has been going on there for 2 
years: a war fought by the most courageous people I know--the 
Ukrainians--against the invasion of Vladimir Putin.
  The United States, NATO allies, and many others have been standing 
behind Ukrainians, and we knew that they needed additional resources to 
continue the battle this year.
  Four months ago, the President put together a supplemental 
appropriations bill for that purpose. It also addressed the situation 
in the Middle East, the Far East, and the looming humanitarian crises 
around the world, including Gaza, that needed to be addressed.
  We wanted to move on this on a timely basis, but there was an 
objection. The objection came from the other side of the aisle, 
Republican Senators who said: You need to include border security. What 
is happening on our southern border cannot be ignored.
  We discussed it for a period of time and then agreed with them. We 
were going to work together on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and 
Democrats, to change what was happening on America's southern border to 
make us safe and to bring order to the situation.
  Several of our colleagues were chosen to engage in the negotiations 
for this issue.
  This is a tough issue. Any issue involving immigration is extremely 
difficult. That is why it has been over 30 years since Congress has 
passed immigration reform, when we know that the body of laws that 
governs our immigration and our border needed attention long ago.
  Three Senators, very diverse Senators, were chosen to negotiate an 
agreement if they could. They were led by Senator Lankford, James 
Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, who was chosen by the Republican 
Senate caucus to be their negotiator. Several of my colleagues on the 
Republican side of the aisle assured me that he had worked hard at it, 
understood the issue, and was prepared to accept this challenge and 
responsibility. So Senator Lankford led in that regard. Two other 
Senators--Senator Sinema of Arizona, who is characterized as an 
Independent Senator at this point in her career, and Senator Chris 
Murphy of Connecticut were the second and third Senators who sat down 
and started negotiating together.
  They put together a package. It took them 4 months. We had to 
postpone the negotiations for Christmas and for other breaks that were 
normal in the Senate calendar. But they were given wide berth to come 
up with an agreement, a bipartisan agreement, and it was announced last 
Sunday.
  Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, released it on Sunday and 
said: I will heed the advice of Senators from both sides of the aisle 
that Members should have 72 hours to review this document before they 
have to vote on it.
  The vote we are talking about this afternoon is that vote, more than 
72 hours after this proposed bill was released.
  What did this bill do that would gain the support of the Democratic 
and Republican Senators who were negotiating? What it did was to 
address many issues--primarily border issues--that related to security.
  The current situation on our border is unsustainable. We are being 
overwhelmed by the number of people who are showing up in record 
numbers. That reflects several things--a refugee crisis around the 
world.
  Those of you who watched ``60 Minutes'' this week noticed that there 
were people from China who are now coming to our southern border to 
come into the United States. No one anticipated that when we talked 
about the asylum laws several years ago, but that is a fact of life. 
People are coming from all around the world to come to our southern 
border, and they are overwhelming the resources of that border.
  This bill--this agreed-to bill, this bipartisan bill--that is being 
considered here this afternoon was an effort by both sides to limit the 
number of people coming across the border at any given time. It gave 
new authority to the President of the United States to cap and limit 
the number of people crossing the border at a given time.
  When those on the other side say we don't need this bill, that is 
legislative authority the President currently doesn't have, and it was 
included. There were billions of dollars of investment in technology to 
stop the flow of not only those who are undocumented and illegal but 
also the flow of fentanyl into the United States, just to name two 
major features of this bill. It had many provisions hammered out over 
months of negotiations.
  Those of us who came back this week said we were finally going to do 
something on the border, and the good news is, it is bipartisan. 
Senator Lankford has signed off on it, and the other two Senators, 
representing the Democratic side of the aisle, signed off on it as 
well. We were prepared to see this pass and hope for the best in the 
House of Representatives.
  Then the bottom dropped out. One thing happened that we didn't 
anticipate. One person in America came out against the proposal. One 
person said to the Republican Senators: Sorry, no matter what you 
agreed to, it is unacceptable. Blame it on me, he said, but we are not 
going to have a bipartisan agreement on the border. This is 
unacceptable.
  That one person is Donald Trump. He made that announcement at that 
point. Many of the Republicans who had indicated interest in this 
measure walked away from it, and today, I am afraid we are going to see 
that in the vote. It is really sad when you consider what is at stake, 
the lives that are at stake all across the United States. People who 
are trying to come to this country with good intentions and good 
purposes and would make us a better nation are being caught up in this 
political battle.
  So when Senator Schumer comes to the floor and expresses his 
disappointment, he speaks for the entire Senate Democratic caucus. We 
are disappointed that we came up with a bipartisan bill with Senator 
Lankford, who has been a stalwart in this whole experience. He has 
shown principle and values and negotiated in good faith. He produced a 
bipartisan bill, and we are prepared to vote for it this afternoon.
  The sad reality is that the assistance to Ukraine, which was one of 
the original reasons for this conversation, is still in doubt. I hope 
at the end of the day that the Democrats can lead the way, with the 
Republicans, and provide the survival assistance absolutely necessary 
for the people in Ukraine. They are watching carefully.
  At the end of next week, a group of us will be going to the Munich 
Security Conference in Germany. It is held each year. It is a 
bipartisan delegation. We go to speak for the United States. What we 
have to say to our European allies will depend on the votes that will 
follow today, the first and the second vote. Will we stand by Ukraine 
or will we walk away from it and let Vladimir Putin have his dream of 
an expansion of the former Soviet system? I hope not.
  The people in Ukraine deserve better. We need to stand together with 
them. There is much to be said as to what this means to the rest of the 
world, but we have been reminded by our NATO allies, who have been 
loyal to a fault so far--and I hope they continue to be--that we can't 
walk away from that situation without inviting disastrous consequences 
around the world.
  I am afraid that if we walk away from Ukraine, they will struggle to 
survive. And I hope they do, but it will be a real struggle. In the 
meantime, it heartens Vladimir Putin and our adversaries around the 
world to see us waiver when it comes to staying with the Ukrainian 
people.
  I hope that vote this afternoon--that both votes are in a positive 
way, that we can take that message to the rest of the world that we are 
still there.
  I also want to say that it is hard to imagine that the party of 
Ronald Reagan and John McCain--the party that claimed to take a strong 
stand

[[Page S432]]

against communism--just played right into the hands of former KGB 
apparatchik Vladimir Putin's hand. That is right--the same Putin who 
called the collapse of Soviet tyranny ``the greatest geopolitical 
catastrophe of the 20th century.''
  Putin and his Iranian and North Korean enablers are trying to roll 
back Western democracy and restore Soviet glory, and the front of the 
line is Ukraine, where the United States and European allies have 
helped these heroic Ukrainians to repel the Russian invasion.
  What is Putin's strategy after suffering staggering losses in 
equipment and personnel? To bet that the United States will allow 
partisanship to interfere with its support of Ukraine and hope that 
former President Trump returns to the White House. That is Putin's 
dream.
  Just as we learned when it came to the agreement--the bipartisan 
agreement--on border security, Donald Trump has made it clear that he 
opposes this continuing assistance to Ukraine.
  You may recall that in 2018, Trump stood next to Putin in Helsinki 
and said he believed Putin's denials about interfering in our election, 
while Putin smirked at the podium.
  By failing to pass national security funding, we would be playing 
into Putin's hands.
  Many congressional Republicans have spoken loudly about defending 
Ukraine and the NATO alliance. They have traveled to NATO summits and 
even Munich security conferences to support this mission. They have 
also visited Ukraine, followed by press conferences with belligerent 
claims that President Biden just wasn't doing enough. But today, the 
fate of Ukraine hangs in the balance on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
  It seems too many of my colleagues have collectively cowered to 
Donald Trump, who wants to tank the supplemental funding agreement for 
his own cynical reasons. Is that who congressional Republicans are 
going to entrust with stopping Russian aggression? Make no mistake, it 
is not only Putin watching and savoring this failure to act; it is 
Iran, China, North Korea, and others.
  I think of the late John McCain and how he would look at the 
situation on the Republican side of the aisle today. He was a fierce 
critic throughout his life of Russian tyranny, especially Putin's 
tyranny. He was the target of Putin's early sanctions, as many of us 
were as well. John McCain took that as a badge of pride, and I do too.
  It is time we show the same courage here in Congress and make sure 
that we pass emergency national security funding. Last I checked, 
protecting democracy and safeguarding American security were bipartisan 
causes, and they should be still.
  I would like to make one last point. It is hard for me to see us 
visit this issue of immigration and not mention an issue that has been 
near and dear to me for more than two decades.
  Today, I want to tell you the story of a Dreamer, Dr. Jacqueline 
Solis. Hers is the 139th Dreamer story I have told on the floor of the 
Senate. Jacqueline was born in Peru and immigrated to this country when 
she was 10. She wanted to become a doctor. She didn't think it was 
possible because she was undocumented.
  Twelve years ago, in response to a bipartisan request from myself and 
the late Senator Richard Lugar, President Obama established DACA 
Program. It has protected more than 800,000 young people like 
Jacqueline. Thanks to DACA, she was able to attend medical school. I am 
proud to say that last year, she graduated from Loyola University 
Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine, the first medical school to 
accept DACA applicants. She is now completing her pediatrics residency 
at Emory University Hospital. DACA allowed her to come out of the 
shadows and give back to the country she grew up in, the country she 
loves: the United States of America. She hopes to be an agent of change 
in her community where she mentors medical students and first-
generation, low-income students. One of her goals is to open a mobile 
clinic where she could drive to different communities and help 
patients.
  Ask yourself: Would America be better off if Dr. Jacqueline Solis and 
Dreamers like her were unable to work in the United States? Still, 20 
years later, we are trying our best to make sure these young people 
have a fighting chance to be part of America's future.
  Last September, a Federal judge in Texas declared the DACA program 
illegal, though the decision left in place protections for current DACA 
recipients while the appeal is pending. These young people live in fear 
that the next court decision will upend their lives. That would be a 
disaster.
  When we get on the subject of immigration, the border is critical. It 
is important. I want to be part of that conversation. Please, don't 
forget the Dreamers, and don't forget so many people who have proven 
over and over again that they are our future and our strength, if given 
that chance.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). The Senator from Oklahoma.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to 
use a prop during this speech.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. LANKFORD. In about an hour, this body will gather. There will be 
100 Senators here to make a decision about what we are going to do to 
take a step on border security. It is an issue that has bedeviled, 
quite frankly, this body for decades. It has been three decades since 
we passed anything into law to be able to change border security.
  In the meantime, administration after administration has pieced 
together broken pieces of law in the disjointing pieces and tried to 
make regulatory actions to see what they can do to be able to change 
the direction of the country.
  We have seen just over the last 10 or 15 years what really happened 
to that. This is just an encounter number from CBP; and we can look 
back to 2009, and we can see the numbers stayed about half a million or 
so for multiple years.
  This is through the Obama administration. They struggled because the 
numbers were lower than this even before. They struggled with half a 
million numbers. We see during the Trump administration how the numbers 
bump up and jump up here almost to a million in a single year, twice as 
many as it was during the Obama time period. Then we see COVID time 
period, it dives back down. Then right there is the transition in 
President Biden's time, and the numbers have skyrocketed. They doubled 
from the Biden administration to this year in the Trump administration, 
but then they tripled even from the highest year of the Trump 
administration during the Biden administration.
  It wasn't a single bump year like it was under the Trump 
administration. It has been year after year after year. By the way, 
this little one is this fiscal year. That is just since October--which 
by the way, you will notice in the last 4 months is higher than any 
year under the Obama administration and almost as high as the peak year 
under the Trump administration, and that is 4 months so far this year.

  Americans feel it. We feel it in our cities. We feel it in our 
schools and our communities. We see the television, and we see all of 
the chaos on our southern border. Cities around the country have said: 
Do something. Make this stop.
  Americans, whether they are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, are 
all unanimous on this issue: This is a problem that needs to be solved; 
do what you can.
  Today, we get to decide if we are going to do that or not; if we are 
going to do nothing or do something. The bill that has been put 
together has been a bipartisan effort. Welcome to the U.S. Senate. That 
is what we have to do. While I have people from around the country and 
back home that say: Do a Republican-only bill; just get all of our 
priorities and none of theirs. I smile at them and say: Welcome to 
governance. You can do a partisan bill in the House, but in the Senate, 
we have to look at each other across the aisle and then figure out a 
way to be able to solve this. Sometimes it is in committees; sometimes 
it is a gathering; sometimes it was like this time: Get Members 
together--Republican, Independent, Democratic--to be able to sit down 
and hash out the issues; to say this is a problem, we all agree. We are 
not going to agree on the solutions, necessarily, but we all agree this 
is a problem. But we have to figure out what the solutions might be.

[[Page S433]]

  That has been the process for the last 4 months--4 months--to sit 
down and hash through the very difficult, very technical issues of 
border security in our Nation with one goal: Let's make progress.
  We understood from the beginning we are not going to solve 
everything. We are not. We knew from the beginning it is not going to 
be perfect. But we also knew the status quo is untenable. We have to do 
something to be able to make the status quo better. So that is what we 
worked towards--to be able to change where we are now.
  The product we put out this past weekend allowed everybody to see it. 
Quite frankly, I had some of my colleagues that said: I will need weeks 
to evaluate it because it is so technical. And it is. But some, 
literally within minutes, said: No, I don't agree.
  Fine. But after time to be able to review it, the National Border 
Patrol Council--the group that is actually on the ground trying to 
manage the chaos--they read through the bill and evaluated it. And the 
National Border Patrol Council gave this statement:

       [The Border Patrol Act of 2024] will give U.S. Border 
     Patrol agents authorities codified, in law, that we have not 
     had in the past.
       While not perfect--

  And I will agree with them on that.

     --the Border Patrol Act of 2024 is a step in the right 
     direction and is far better than the current status quo. This 
     is why the National Border Patrol Council endorses this bill 
     and hopes for its quick passage.

  I understand this: In this building and in the 202 area code that is 
Washington, DC, border security is a political issue. But if we leave 
the 202 area code, everywhere else in the country, this is not a 
political issue; it is a national security issue. And when you actually 
go to the Border Patrol Council, those that see the chaos day-to-day, 
they are saying: Send us some help; send us anything.
  Quite frankly, Americans are frustrated and angry because our borders 
are open. They have seen the record numbers in the last 4 months. They 
know full well what is happening. The ``60 Minutes'' story from this 
last weekend was about Chinese nationals using TikTok to be able to 
find the holes in the fence and to be able to navigate it; how to be 
able to connect with Mexican cartel members to be able to navigate in 
through Mexico to be able to get through. Why is that such a big story? 
Because we used to rarely have Chinese nationals come across our 
border. But yet, last year, we had 37,000 Chinese nationals come across 
our border--37,000.
  Americans watched the story of a group of migrants in New York City 
ruthlessly beating up a police officer this past week. And then see 
they were released again. They are angry. They are frustrated. The 
stories that have come out in the news recently of three child sex 
traffickers who had attempted reentry back into the United States make 
Americans go: Hold on.
  Just a few days ago, there was a story coming out of an al-Shabaab--
terrorists on our Terror Watchlist--that had come across our border and 
had been released just early last year. They then picked them up while 
they were in Minnesota just a few weeks ago.
  We have had 50 people that have been identified on the Terror 
Watchlist that we did apprehend in just the last 4 months. We have had 
tens of thousands of people in the last year that were identified by 
this administration as individuals who were what they call special 
interest aliens. By definition, they are a national security risk. 
There are tens of thousands that we didn't know their name, in 
particular, but we know that where they live is in an area of high 
national security risk because the high terrorism rate is coming from 
that area. We have no criminal history on them to be able to identify 
them on our Terror Watchlist, but we know there is a high chance they 
are a national security risk.
  Those individuals were released into the country. Americans feel it. 
They want something different. The Americans that I talk to, the 
Oklahomans that I talk to don't mind legal immigration. In fact, they 
celebrate legal immigration. They just don't want illegal immigration.
  They want an orderly process. They want to know that the rule of law 
still matters in America. That is what they want to know. They want to 
know their American way of life is protected, and that should not be 
too much to demand.
  This very divided Nation brings to us a very divided Congress. 
Currently, we have a Republican two-vote majority in the House of 
Representatives and a Democrat one-vote majority in the U.S. Senate. It 
doesn't get much closer than that to being equally divided in two 
bodies.
  But that means, if we are going to solve something, we have to sit 
down together and solve it. That is how it works when you make law. You 
can do press conferences without the other side, but you can't make law 
without the other side in the U.S. Senate. So we have to sit down and 
work things out.
  In October, when Israel was ruthlessly attacked with a terrorist 
attack by Hamas, the President of the United States came to Congress 
and said: We need additional funding to help Israel, to help Ukraine, 
to help with the threats in Taiwan, and additional money for our 
southern border.
  Republicans responded by saying: We are not going to help give money 
to the southern border--by the way, especially for some of the funding 
that they asked for on the southern border, like safe migration offices 
to be able to help facilitate greater traffic to the United States.
  We said: We are not going to do that. We are not going to give 
additional money to the southern border unless we get a change in law 
and policy.
  That is not a radical concept, quite frankly. The House of 
Representatives, last year, passed a very comprehensive bill on border 
security that they call H.R. 2. It was one of their priorities. Do you 
know why? Because the House of Representatives, at that time, said: We 
need a change in law. So they brought a bill to change the law for 
that.
  We said the same thing: We need a change in law because it is 
significant what has occurred, and we need to address it.
  The frightening thing is, since we started meeting in a bipartisan 
way in October, October was the highest number of illegal crossings of 
any October in our history. November was the highest number of illegal 
crossings of any November in our history. December was the highest 
number of illegal crossings of any December in our history and the 
highest single month in history of illegal crossings, including having 
the highest single day ever in the history of our country in illegal 
crossings: Over 12,000 in a single day.
  That is what has happened just since we have been negotiating this 
bill trying to be able to get to a solution. The problem has not gotten 
better. It has gotten worse during that time period. We need to solve 
this. The worst-case scenario is the status quo. We need to solve it.
  So we came up with a bill. It doesn't have everything in it I wanted. 
It doesn't have everything in it my Democratic colleagues wanted. But 
it definitely makes a difference.
  What is in this bill?
  Well, here is what the bill includes. Let me just walk through some 
of the high points of it. It includes more border wall construction, 
under the 18-foot, 30-foot bollard-style definition, in locations, 
actually, that were set by President Trump in those locations to 
actually build a wall.
  It has 50,000 detention beds. So it ends our catch-and-release issue. 
So especially single adults, as they are coming across, the vast 
majority end up being held while they are being screened there, rather 
than just released into the country as they are now.
  We doubled the deportation flights. We added money for DNA testing. 
We added money for additional State, local, and private law enforcement 
that we are partnering with along the border to be able to help with 
the enforcement process there.
  We have a tremendous increase in the number of ICE agents, the number 
of Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, more immigration judges.
  We added detection equipment at our ports of entry to interdict 
fentanyl, one of the biggest threats to our Nation right now.
  And we increased the sanction authority for the U.S. Government to be 
able to sanction those ruthless cartels and members of cartels and 
those that facilitate them to be able to go after the fentanyl issue in 
the United States.

[[Page S434]]

  It has a pretty radical change in asylum law in it. It strengthens 
significantly the standard of evidence for declaring asylum. Today, 
people who are crossing the border can literally cross and say: ``I 
have fear in my country.'' When they say those magic words, they are 
released into the country--the vast majority of them--for up to 10 
years, while they await their screening or hearing. That would end 
under this bill.
  We increase significantly the standard for evidence. We add three new 
eligibility bars at the beginning of it so we get to a faster screening 
process and, for those who are not eligible, a faster deportation.
  It is somewhat of a ``Where's Waldo?'' game on a day-to-day basis on 
our southern border, as we have thousands of people coming through. 
Some of those individuals do qualify for asylum, but most of them do 
not. So our goal was to be able to filter through quickly, identify 
those who qualify, and deport all of them who do not.
  We have a faster structure to process aliens when they cross the 
border, in detention or nondetained, either one, so they don't end up 
in the 10-year backlog awaiting their decision--both for those who 
qualify for asylum, so they don't wait 10 years, and those that 
everyone knows, from the beginning, they don't qualify for asylum, they 
are turned around and deported immediately.
  This ends the abuse of parole that is happening on our southern 
border today. Today, the administration will identify 1,500 people, 
will give them parole authority at one of our ports of entry and a work 
permit the first day they come.
  They don't have to qualify for asylum. They don't even have to apply 
for asylum. It is literally an open invitation for anyone anywhere in 
the world to get a work permit if you will just tell us in advance you 
are coming. It is not lawful. It is just happening. This bill would end 
that.
  This bill also has a short-term, 3-year authority to quickly stop the 
flow of people coming into our country right now.
  I had a lot of my colleagues on the Republican side that said: 
Whatever we pass will never be implemented by the Biden administration. 
We have got to do something, though, right now, to be able to get 
things to change, because everyone knows this is occurring not because 
of some migration trends around the world but because right there, 
President Biden announced, ``I am not going to build any more wall,'' 
and he dropped all the authorities that had been used not just by 
President Trump but by Presidents Trump and Obama. He dropped them, and 
we saw this skyrocket.

  So everyone said: Whatever we pass, President Biden will never use. 
So whatever you can put in there to be able to actually make sure this 
occurs, please do.
  So we did. We included a border emergency authority that said if we 
ever exceed 5,000 people--which, by the way, is every day but 7 in the 
last 4 months--if we ever exceed 5,000 people and we are at chaos 
level, the border shuts down completely. It is not optional; it is 
mandatory.
  And when I say ``shut down,'' it is pretty simple. What happens for 
the first 5,000? Let me make it clear. For the first 5,000 people who 
are coming across, they are detained, they are screened, and then 
deported. If you get above 5,000, we are in such a chaotic moment that 
we don't have time. So we just detain and deport them. There is no 
screening at all because we have run out of time. We don't have the 
manpower to do it. That is the shift that occurs.
  It is not that the first 5,000 are released. That is ridiculous. The 
first 5,000 we detain, we screen, and then we deport. The second, if we 
get above 5,000, we just detain and deport. And when the border is 
closed down, it is closed down for weeks, where we are not even 
screening for weeks until we get caught up. It was something that we 
could implement right now and to be able to make a difference.
  We also changed the funding process on this. There are items that the 
President really wanted on some of the funding. So we said: We are fine 
on that funding, as long as you don't get that funding until you 
actually get more detention beds, get more deportation flights, hire 
more ICE officers, hire more Border Patrol, and actually implement the 
new policy. When you do that, then you get all of the money that you 
are actually looking for in the other areas.
  We wanted to make sure that, actually, this was going to be 
implemented. So we included that in the bill today. That is what we 
have on the floor today, and I am afraid of what I have heard some 
people say: It is not enough.
  So we will make a decision soon. Let me just say this. I have 
listened to a lot of my colleagues in the last several days, as well I 
should. I have listened for months. Some people legitimately want more 
time to read the bill. I will tell you it is 370 pages. It is 
incredibly technical. And I have had several colleagues say: I started 
to read it, and it makes my head hurt to read it because immigration 
law is very complicated.
  So they are going through it, and they said: Hey, I am interested in 
supporting this. I just need more time.
  Some of those folks are going to vote no today because they 
legitimately need more time. I completely understand that.
  There are some folks who are voting no today because they have policy 
differences on the bill. We have asylum officers that are empowered to 
make decisions; they want immigration judges to make it. OK, that is a 
policy difference on it.
  Some folks don't like that we have visas that are in this. That 
increases legal immigration--not illegal, legal immigration--in the 
country. There are some folks that don't want any immigration of any 
type. Well, fine, we can have that policy difference. I don't mind 
legal immigration. I just don't want illegal immigration.
  Some of them may have policy differences. Some of them have been very 
clear with me that they have political differences with the bill. They 
say it is the wrong time to solve the problem, or let the Presidential 
election solve this problem.
  In fact, I had a popular commentator, 4 weeks ago, that I talked to, 
that told me flat out, before they knew any of the contents of the 
bill--any of the contents, nothing was out at that point--that told me 
flat out: If you try to move a bill that solves the border crisis 
during this Presidential year, I will do whatever I can to destroy you, 
because I do not want you to solve this during the Presidential 
election.
  By the way, they have been faithful to their promise and have done 
everything they can to destroy me in the past several weeks.
  There are other folks that read the Facebook posts and the Twitter 
posts and saw different facts that they thought might be true, but I 
have personally told them over and over again they are false. And it 
has been hard to overcome.
  For some reason, we still believe everything we read on the internet, 
and it has been hard to be able to break through. A few weeks ago, I 
posted one of my favorite quotes from Charles Haddon Spurgeon, who was 
a preacher from England in the 1850s, where he once said:

       A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets 
     its boots on.

  And it couldn't have proved to be more true than this. I have seen 
posts like, ``There is amnesty in this bill,'' so that people are 
adamantly opposed that there is amnesty in the bill.
  I would say that some of my Democratic colleagues wanted to have some 
amnesty in this bill, but there wasn't, and there is not anything on 
amnesty in this bill.
  I have heard folks say it weakens our asylum laws, when it actually 
does the opposite. It far strengthens our asylum laws, so we can get to 
actual asylees faster, and those who are gaming the system are turned 
around.
  I have had folks say it takes away the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy so 
they can never come back. It does nothing of that at all--nothing of 
that.
  I have had folks say it gives away work permits the very first day, 
which will incentivize more people to come, when it actually does 
exactly the opposite. It actually removes the 1,500 work permits that 
are passed out every day and says we are not going to do that.
  And my favorite one has been: It lets 5,000 aliens in every single 
day from here on out forever.
  And I have just said that is completely absurd. Why would anyone--

[[Page S435]]

anyone--sign a bill, approve a bill, or present a bill that locks us 
into this chaos. That is what we have now. The 5,000 piece was very 
simple. If we get to 5,000 a day, we can't process that many people 
anymore. It is a critical emergency. We break glass and say we are not 
even going to try to do hearings anymore. Everybody has got to turn 
around. Everything is shut down so we can make sure that we can 
actually legally process people. We are detaining, screening, and 
deporting until we get to a break-glass moment, and then we are not 
even screening anymore. We are just detaining and deporting because we 
can't manage the numbers.
  But that is not what has been told. What has been told has been false 
day after day.
  And then, as I have mentioned, I have had a few folks that have said: 
If I can't get everything, I want nothing.
  I don't find most Americans are that way just in their day-to-day 
life. We have high goals and aspirations as Americans, and, quite 
frankly, I don't blame Americans for being really angry and frustrated 
about where we are at the border--really angry and frustrated.
  But what I hear from most Oklahomans is: Do something. Don't just sit 
there. Do something. Make progress. But don't allow this to keep going. 
Stop it where you can. So that is what we worked do.

  Now, to be clear, President Biden has authorities he could have used 
that he has chosen not to. Authorities that President Trump used, 
authorities that President Obama used, President Biden has chosen not 
to use. There are a lot of them. And for whatever reason, he has turned 
his head away from the chaos that America is focused on, and he needs 
to do what he can to solve this problem.
  But we also need to make changes in law. Our asylum law is weak. 
Everyone knows this. In fact, when President Trump was President, he 
even made the statements about how weak our laws are on asylum. When 
President Trump was President, he said, ``We do a very good job 
considering the laws are so bad. They are not archaic; they are 
incompetent. It is not that they are old; they are just bad.''
  Well, guess what this bill does. Fixes that because the laws have a 
gap, and we should actually fix those things.
  What the President cannot do is change the asylum laws. He cannot 
change the faster deportations for people crossing. He cannot add an 
emergency authority like this. He cannot conduct faster hearings with 
limited appeals so we can get to deporting people who are not legal 
here and addressing those who are. We can't do that without a change in 
law, so we need to change the law.
  I am going to vote yes to be able to move on to this bill. So we need 
a change in the law. I understand we have differences, but we have got 
to sit down together, figure out how we are going to solve problems 
because the American people sent us here to do that.
  This is the pen that I was handed at that desk when I was sworn into 
the U.S. Senate, and I signed a book that was at that desk with this 
pen because I was becoming a U.S. Senator because the people at home 
sent me here to get stuff done and to solve problems. There is no 
reason for me to have this pen if we are just going to do press 
conferences. I can do press conferences from anywhere, but we can only 
make law from this room. And to do that, you need one of these pens, 
and there are 100 of them in this room, and 60 of us have to agree to 
solve a problem.
  And I am determined to sit down with anyone who wants to solve the 
problem, regardless of what side of the aisle that they are on, to 
figure out how we solve these things because Americans are ticked off 
that this is not resolved, and they expect us to get things done. So 
why don't we do that?
  I have two staff members named Sarah Seitz and Jacob Stubbs, who have 
worked their tails off for 4 months. They gave up Thanksgiving; they 
gave up Christmas; they gave up New Year's to work on this. They are 
remarkable leaders. But it is not just about the time they gave up and 
the wisdom that they have as leaders, their focus on that was to solve 
a problem that at the end of this day, may still be a problem unsolved. 
And tomorrow, we will probably have 6,500 people illegally cross our 
border just like what is happening right now, today--6,500 people.
  Americans want that stopped. So let's actually sit down and figure 
out how we are going to stop it together.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to speak before the vote today, 
but I do hope that all of my colleagues heard the Senator from 
Oklahoma, heard his powerful words, especially the last several 
minutes, and pause and think about it. They were critically important 
for each one of us to think about, and I thank the Senator for all of 
his work on this and for his powerful statement just now.
  But if you want to understand why people can't stand politics, watch 
how many Republicans vote against this bill. Some of my colleagues do 
not seem to understand this is not a game. There is a war happening 
right now in Ukraine where our allies are being gunned down and Putin 
is rolling his tanks into their homeland. There is a war happening 
right now between Israel and Hamas. There are civilians at this very 
moment caught in the crossfire. There are partners in the Indo-Pacific 
wondering if they can count on us. And let's not forget, there is the 
border, the site of countless Republican photo ops, where we have a 
genuine need of reforms and resources.
  That is the moment we are in. That is the moment that this package is 
meant to address. And by voting it down, Republicans will be telling 
our allies, our word cannot be trusted; telling dictators like Putin 
that our threats are not serious; telling the world, American 
leadership has been hollowed out by Republican obstructionism. And 
let's be clear, they will be telling the American people they don't 
want to solve the crisis at the border; they want to campaign on it 
because if you genuinely believe something is a crisis, you take any 
step you can to address it. You don't let a fire burn because Donald 
Trump wants to campaign on ashes.
  We have heard a lot of talk from Republicans about the border, about 
countering the Chinese Government, about supporting Israel and standing 
up to Putin. But governing is about action. Governing is about 
compromise. Governing is about standing behind your word in order to 
solve problems.
  And I am sorry to say that despite the talks from many Republicans 
about continuing to support Ukraine, they have yet to join us in 
actually voting for serious aid for Ukraine since last Congress.
  As the minority leader admitted yesterday, this was all because his 
side, Republicans, insisted--insisted--Ukraine aid be tied to border 
policies--a standard, by the way, that they have not applied to any of 
our other allies and one that tells every country who would partner 
with us that you better hope you don't become leverage for an 
unrelated, partisan demand.
  It was an absurd request. I have said so from the start. But a lot 
hangs in the balance, so Democrats listened to them and took them at 
their word and have been glued to the negotiating table in order to 
address this problem, and I want to thank, from the bottom of my heart, 
my colleagues--to Senator Sinema, to Senator Lankford, to Senator 
Murphy--they worked so long and hard to hammer out a deal on border 
policies, one that is, quite frankly, more conservative than many of us 
would have liked, including myself.

  But I worked tirelessly with my vice chair, the senior Senator from 
Maine, to ensure that the border resources were there to help address 
this problem. And through listening and compromising and working 
together in good faith, we reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the 
border policies that others negotiated.
  And now after saying they had to have both of these in the package in 
order to support it, Republicans are now poised to kill it. Republicans 
went from ``We demand border policy changes'' to ``No policy is 
needed.'' They went from ``We need time to look at this bill'' to 
``Dead on arrival'' in less than 24 hours. They went from ``The border 
is a crisis right now'' to ``It can wait until November,'' in the blink 
of an eye--and will not support the bipartisan policy nor the 
bipartisan funding.
  What changed? What changed? Well, Donald Trump ordered Republicans to

[[Page S436]]

kill the bipartisan border deal. Trump has not been subtle. He has 
literally said: ``Please blame it on me,'' if this deal goes down in 
flames, and there is no action on the border.
  And we are going to see today just how many Republicans fall in line, 
and it may well be most of them. But I would remind my colleagues, the 
American people are the ones who sent us here, not Donald Trump. They 
are the ones we should answer to, not Donald Trump. And I think we all 
know the folks back home sent us here to solve problems--to solve 
problems--not to block bipartisan solutions. They want us to work 
together. They want us to make progress, even when it isn't perfect.
  And, frankly, if that doesn't convince you to support this bill, if 
you are still thinking about what is good politics, not good policy, I 
still don't know why you would listen to Donald Trump because solving 
problems, that is good politics. Maintaining America's national 
security, that is good politics.
  So I hope all of my Republican colleagues will think about this vote 
carefully. How long will you give Donald Trump a permanent veto over 
whatever policy he decides he doesn't like or isn't helpful to him 
personally? I have to ask: What is the point of being a Senator if you 
let Donald Trump make all of the decisions for you?
  It wasn't so long ago that Donald Trump incited an actual 
insurrection. We all had to flee or we barricaded ourselves into our 
offices. Did any of my colleagues on the other side think you would let 
that same man dictate what policy you could or couldn't even debate? It 
was just 3 short years ago that some of you, on the other side, voted--
and many of us voted--to remove Trump from office.
  So I ask my colleagues: Please listen when I say today is a critical 
vote. Today is a day to decide. Today is a vote about whether we, as 
U.S. Senators, will keep our word when we negotiate with each other. 
Today is a day we, as U.S. Senators, will vote to show we will work 
together to stand up for American interests and national security at 
home and abroad. And today is a day we, as Senators, show the world we 
are a country that stands behind our word and stands with our allies 
and works past politics to do what is right for this country and the 
people we were sent here to represent.
  I hope my colleagues will think about that long and hard, and then I 
sincerely hope they will do the right thing and abandon the MAGA 
politics.
  There is so much work we have left to do together moving forward, and 
you should all know me well enough to know I am always ready to work 
together, not against one another. So even if this vote fails, I am 
determined to not let partisanship win the day. We are going to try 
again to pass a package that gets our allies the aid they so 
desperately need, and I hope before we get to that, that every Senator 
in this body listens to what the Senator from Oklahoma said and pauses 
and thinks about what their word means to the people who sent them here 
to do the right thing for our country.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.
  Ms. SINEMA. I stand here today as the border crisis is devastating my 
State. Just last week, Nogales officers seized 2.1 million fentanyl 
pills at a port of entry. Just last week, Border Patrol agents 
recovered in the Tucson desert enough fentanyl to kill 340,000 
Americans. Just last week, nearly 14,000 migrants crossed into 
Arizona--many of them are military-aged men coming from all across the 
globe.
  Our broken border system is a national security crisis. Last 
September, when my Republican colleagues demanded, with a clear and 
unified voice, that border security must be included in Congress's 
national security package, I wholeheartedly agreed. Finally, it seemed, 
we had the opportunity to solve the nightmare my State has lived for 
over 40 years.

  So I got to work. My Republican colleagues chose Senator James 
Lankford, my partner on the Homeland Security Border Management 
Subcommittee. We have worked together for over 5 years on strong border 
policy. Senator Lankford has joined me at the Arizona border to see the 
crisis firsthand. Senator Lankford is an incredibly smart, earnest, 
conservative lawmaker. I know he was chosen by his conference because 
of his expertise and knowledge of border security policy and his 
reputation as a serious conservative lawmaker who cares deeply about 
getting policy right.
  As we started the negotiation, Senator Lankford laid out four policy 
pillars the Republican conference needed to secure the border.
  No. 1, asylum. Raise the asylum standard and close the loopholes so 
cartels and economic migrants can no longer exploit the system.
  No. 2, safe third country. Ensure that people who have lived safely 
in another country don't backlog our system because they do not qualify 
for asylum.
  No. 3, close the border. Create a title 42-like authority to shut 
down the border when our system is backlogged and overwhelmed.
  No. 4, parole. Stop the administration from giving migrants at the 
border a free pass into our country.
  Over the course of nearly 5 months, we worked every single day 
navigating the intricate and difficult policy decisions to meet these 
four pillars. And when we hit bumps, I reminded everyone at the table 
about what was happening on the ground at my border--what real life 
looks like in Arizona--because I knew that those four key pillars were 
necessary to secure the border and solve the crisis.
  That is why, just yesterday when endorsing our bill, Yuma Mayor Doug 
Nicholls said:

       Thank you . . . for incorporating many of the specific 
     issues that border leaders have asked to be addressed.

  So together with Senators Lankford and Murphy and our incredibly 
talented staffs, including my staff director on the Border Management 
Subcommittee, Anthony Papian, who is here today, we worked through 
weekends and through holidays to get these policies right. Senator 
Murphy, Senator Lankford, and I--we all negotiated in good faith.
  We delivered. We produced a bill many thought impossible. Our bill 
overhauls the broken system. It stops the misuse of parole, and it 
closes the border during surges, ensuring the quick detention and 
deportation of migrants who don't have a legal right to be here. We end 
catch-and-release. We add more detention beds. We increase deportation 
flights. We quickly decide asylum claims. We put Border Patrol back in 
the desert catching the bad guys and the drugs.
  That is why the National Border Patrol Council endorses our bill, not 
H.R. 2. We produced a bill that finally, after decades of all talk and 
no action, secures the border and solves the border crisis.
  Our bill was ready for prime time. We were ready to bring the bill to 
the floor, open it up for debate and amendments--you know, how the 
Senate is supposed to work--and then pass the bill.
  But less than 24 hours after we released the bill, my Republican 
colleagues changed their minds. Turns out they want all talk and no 
action. It turns out border security is not actually a risk to our 
national security; it is just a talking point for the election.
  After all of their cable news appearances, after all those campaign 
photo ops in the desert, after all those trips to the border, this 
crisis isn't actually much of a crisis after all.
  Sunday morning, there was a real crisis at the border. Monday 
morning, that crisis magically disappeared.
  Well, guess what, guys. The crisis is real.
  It is real in Arizona. On Sunday, the day we released our bill, over 
6,000 migrants crossed the border. On Monday, the day this body decided 
the border crisis was no longer a crisis, over 6,500 migrants crossed 
the border. And yesterday, the day the Republican conference Members 
said that we are not going to pass a border bill, the day my colleagues 
said no, nearly 7,000 migrants crossed the border.
  The border emergency authority in our border bill would have shut the 
border down, literally, every single day this year.
  Now, I have been sharing the facts of our bill to anyone who would 
listen. I have refuted the lie that says our bill allows 5,000 migrants 
to enter the country every day. In fact, our bill stops those migrants 
from coming into the country every day.
  Meanwhile, by killing our bill, we have no title 42-like authority to 
shut

[[Page S437]]

down the border. So, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 10,000, or even 14,000 
migrants can cross into our country every single day.
  Make no mistake--a vote against this bill is a vote for the status 
quo. It is a vote for continued chaos at our border.
  Our current system lets migrants into the country with nothing but a 
piece of paper--a notice to appear for a court day years into the 
future and no accountability structure to ensure they actually show up.
  In Arizona, this broken system is commonly called catch-and-release. 
It has been happening for years.
  Our bill ends catch-and-release. But when this bill fails, catch-and-
release will continue every single day.
  Some people say the President has all the authority he needs to 
secure the border. Then, tell me why Arizona has lived the nightmare of 
our border crisis for over 40 years and through the past five 
administrations--Republican and Democratic? Before COVID, the last 
administration tried to shut down the border. The courts stopped it. 
After COVID, the courts struck down title 42.
  It is clear: We need a law.
  I have heard from some that the only solution is the House Republican 
bill, H.R. 2. To them, I'd point out that our bill, unlike H.R. 2, 
actually includes penalties for those who try to cross the border when 
it is shut down, creating a 1-year bar for anyone who tries to cross 
twice. H.R. 2? No consequences.
  H.R. 2 continues the current flawed policy that allows migrants to 
get work permits without any asylum interview. Our bill ends that. That 
is why the conservative Wall Street Journal Editorial Board called our 
bill the most restrictive migrant legislation in decades.
  We make sure only those actually fleeing violence and persecution can 
stay here and work, after they pass a new, faster, tougher screening.
  And if someone doesn't finish the asylum process, their work permit 
gets taken away. H.R. 2? Silent.
  H.R. 2 doesn't even fund new detention beds, guys. H.R. 2--another 
example of all talk and no action.
  So if you want to spin the border crisis for your own political 
agendas, go right ahead.
  If you want to continue to use the southern border as a backdrop for 
your political campaign, that is fine. Good luck to you.
  But I have a very clear message for anyone using the southern border 
for staged political events: Don't come to Arizona. Take your political 
theater to Texas. Do not bring it to my State, because in Arizona, we 
are serious. We don't have time for your political games. We are not 
interested in you posing for the cameras.
  In Arizona, we are busy. Just ask Cochise County ranchers David and 
Tina Thompson. They live in the reality of our broken border every time 
that migrants attempt to break into their home.
  Ask Bisbee City Council member Leslie Johns, who had to open the 
doors of the town's city council building and clear out the chambers 
for migrants to sleep on the floor after they were released into a tiny 
town with no shelter and just one bus stop.
  Or ask Yuma farmer John Boelts who does his best to manage his farm 
despite the lettuce crops constantly trampled by migrants crossing his 
produce fields.
  Or ask Bernadette Nez, the manager of Why Not Travel convenience 
store in Why, AZ, who lost thousands of dollars every day before 
Christmas while the Lukeville port of entry was closed.
  Or ask Sierra Vista Mayor Clea McCaa, who lays in bed at night scared 
that his teenage daughter could die in one of the daily, deadly high-
speed chases of teenagers smuggling drugs and people from the border up 
to Phoenix and, next, into your State.
  Or ask Bisbee Mayor Ken Budge, who is pleading with each and every 
one of you to understand how your political games hurt border towns 
like his. As he said yesterday:

       I am saddened after all these months, now some Senators 
     have second thoughts about this from both parties . . .
       . . . I would like to ask any of them to reverse their 
     roles and trade places with me. How they would like to live 
     in my home as a helicopter circled my home at 6:30 in the 
     morning for about an hour, as was the case today.

  This is life in my border State. This is Arizona.
  Earlier this week, it was noted that while facts on the border 
haven't changed, the politics in the country have changed.
  I guess that is it. The politics changed.
  Three weeks ago, everyone wanted to solve the border crisis. 
Yesterday, no one did.
  For 4 months, we were stymied on action to support our allies and 
stand up to Putin's illegal war. For 4 months, we have been unable to 
move forward--unable to defend democracy overseas because of the urgent 
need to secure our border.
  And then, suddenly, in the last 48 hours, the border no longer 
matters.
  Some in this Chamber say: Let's just drop it. Hey, let's wait for the 
election. Let's sort this out in the next Congress. Let's move on.
  Arizona can't move on.
  You here can decide this crisis is over, but the crisis is still real 
in my State. And it will be tomorrow and the next day and the next day.
  I usually end my speeches by calling on the better angels of our 
nature. When we work together, we can solve problems.
  We did that here, and you decided no. You decided you don't even want 
to debate it. You don't want to amend it. You don't want to tackle the 
problem.
  Partisanship won. The Senate has failed Arizona.
  Shameful.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank the Senator from Arizona for her strong, 
courageous, and heartfelt words.
  Now, briefly, Madam President, Senators have a chance to show 
precisely where they stand: Are they for border security or are they 
not?
  The choice is plain and simple, and this vote will show precisely who 
is serious about securing the border and who is not.
  We hope our Republican colleagues, so many of whom know this is the 
right thing to do, will not bend to the wishes of Donald Trump, who 
only wants chaos.


                      Unanimous Consent Agreement

  Now, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory 
quorum call for the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to H.R. 815 
be waived.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.


                             Cloture Motion

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before 
the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.

       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the 
     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to 
     proceed to Calendar No. 30, H.R. 815, a bill to amend title 
     38, United States Code, to make certain improvements relating 
     to the eligibility of veterans to receive reimbursement for 
     emergency treatment furnished through the Veterans Community 
     Care program, and for other purposes.
         Charles E. Schumer, Patty Murray, Benjamin L. Cardin, 
           Robert P. Casey, Jr., Mark R. Warner, Michael F. 
           Bennet, Catherine Cortez Masto, Margaret Wood Hassan,

           Blumenthal, Christopher Murphy, Brian Schatz.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum

Code, to make certain improvements relating to the eligibility of 
veterans to receive reimbursement for emergency treatment furnished 
through the Veterans Community Care program, and for other purposes, 
shall be brought to a close?

                            MORNING BUSINESS

                                 ______
                                 

                REMEMBERING WILLIAM H. ``BILL'' NORTHEY

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this week, a dear friend of mine and 
the Grassley family passed away unexpectedly at age 64. A fourth-
generation family farmer, Bill Northey was a son of the soil from 
Northwest Iowa, where Iowa Nice and a strong work ethic run through the 
bloodstreams in smalltown Iowa.
  Bill graduated from Iowa State University in 1981 with an 
undergraduate degree in agricultural business. A quarter-century later, 
he earned a master of business administration from Southwest Minnesota 
State University. After graduating from Iowa State, Bill returned home 
to the family farm near Spirit Lake, IA, in Dickinson County. Here, 
Bill practiced what he preached. The Northey family farm implemented 
conservation-friendly farming practices, including reduced tillage, 
cover crops, and GPS on its corn and soybean acres.
  At age 20, in the midst of the farm crisis in 1985, Bill was the only 
local farmer to show up at a meeting organized by the Iowa Corn Growers 
Association. Unbeknownst to Bill at the time, that meeting launched his 
public service career. He ran for the Iowa Corn Growers board and, 
later on, became president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association and the 
National Corn Growers Association.
  His resume reflects his lifelong commitment to and champion for Iowa 
agriculture. Bill cut his teeth in public service at the grassroots, 
where he served as a commissioner of the Dickinson County Soil and 
Water Conservation District and rose through the ranks of the Iowa Farm 
Bureau at the county and State levels. In 2006, he ran and won a 
statewide election to serve as Iowa Agriculture Secretary, where he 
served from 2007 to 2018. He served at the helm of the Iowa Department 
of Agriculture and Land Stewardship for 11 years, winning reelection in 
2010 and 2014. Under his leadership, Bill championed renewable fuels, a 
statewide voluntary water quality program and led Iowa producers 
through animal disease outbreaks, including the State's bird flu 
outbreak in 2014-2015 that has helped guide responses today to the 
highly contagious disease.
  President Trump tapped Bill to serve as the first USDA Undersecretary 
for Farm Production and Conservation, where he served under Ag 
Secretary Sonny Perdue until 2021. Bill was caught in some crossfire 
over regional disputes related to the Renewable Fuel Standard. Without 
hesitation, I went toe-to-toe with Texas Senators in support of his 
nomination. Bill was highly qualified and deserving of the 
responsibility to serve in this leadership role for America's farmers. 
Bill never wavered in his patience and commitment to public service. He 
weathered the nomination storm with grace and self-sacrifice over an 
issue that is important to the farm economy, U.S. energy independence, 
national security, and the environment.
  Once confirmed to the USDA post, Bill oversaw a division with 21,000 
employees who worked across 3,000 locations. Traveling to 48 of 50 
States, Bill expanded his agrarian horizons beyond the row crops of 
Middle America. But for Bill, there was no place like home. After 
leaving the USDA, Bill returned to Iowa and was hired to lead the 
Agribusiness Association of Iowa, an organization whose 1,100-plus 
membership supplies feed, seed, crop protection chemicals, grain, 
fertilizer, equipment, and more to support Iowa's agricultural supply 
chain across the State.
  Bill was a natural leader. His decades of advocacy for Iowa 
agriculture came naturally. It was rooted bone-deep in his heritage as 
family farmer. A steward of the soil, Bill understood that a farmer's 
livelihood hinges on protecting natural resources and the whims of 
Mother Nature. He brought dirt-underneath-the-fingernails work 
experience to the policymaking table where his voice mattered. That was 
because Bill spoke with authority, with farm-calloused hands and the 
authenticity of a farmer's heart. He knew the challenges farmers faced 
from 1 year to the next. A soft-spoken leader, Bill had gravitational 
pull with the people he worked with and for the people he served. He 
was approachable, affable, and put in the work. A thoughtful leader, 
Bill was a problem-solver who led by example. As one of the architects 
of

[[Page S439]]

the Nutrient Reduction Strategy and early adopter of cover crops to 
improve water quality, Bill was known to tell farmers, whose 
livelihoods depend on environmental stewardship, that such programs are 
voluntary, but ``not optional.''
  Named an Iowa Master Farmer in 2016, the Iowa farm community has lost 
a giant. Barbara and I have lost a dear friend. His leadership and 
friendship will be missed. Iowa farmers will benefit from his work to 
promote conservation and their work to feed and fuel the world for 
generations to come. To his beloved wife Cindy, three daughters, 
grandchildren, extended family, and loved ones, Barbara and I send our 
prayers and condolences. May Bill's memory heal your hearts and evoke 
smiles and laughter around the dinner table in the days and years to 
come.

                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, last week marked the beginning of Black 
History Month. And so I come to the floor today to celebrate the 
important roles Black Americans have played both in my home State of 
Maryland and in U.S. foreign policy.
  Paying homage to our country's rich Black heritage--including 
learning about the challenges Black Americans have overcome--makes our 
Nation stronger, both at home and abroad. But in recent years, this 
history has become increasingly polarized and politicized.
  The rise of the ``war on woke'' has led to a growing hostility toward 
diversity and inclusivity. It has led to the rewriting and even 
omitting, of brutal, but significant parts of our Nation's story.
  We cannot allow this to overshadow our celebration. We must not shy 
away from studying our Nation's history with thoughtful critique. We 
should not settle for sanitized lessons of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and others in America's classrooms--
because Black History Month, like many of our cultural heritage months, 
should be a time to illuminate stories that may otherwise get lost. 
Overlooking such stories, especially in a State like Maryland, a place 
rich with Black history, would be a travesty--Maryland, the site of 
Kunta Kinte's arrival at the docks in Annapolis, as told in Alex 
Haley's ``Roots''; Maryland, home to greats like Harriet Tubman and 
Thurgood Marshall; Maryland, where Black waterman have lived on the 
Eastern Shore for generations.
  This week, I had the privilege of meeting with Black watermen and 
their families, families who were some of the original stewards of the 
Chesapeake Bay. They were boat captains and admirals, fishermen and 
entrepreneurs, oyster shuckers and crab pickers. They laid the 
foundation for the aquaculture and maritime industry that is so heavily 
stitched in the fabric of Maryland's culture. They were descendants of 
William Samuel Turner whose family owned and operated seafood 
processing enterprises that anchored Bellevue, a historic African-
American neighborhood on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
  Frederick Jewett, one of the first in the Chesapeake Bay to sell 
crabs and crabmeat and developed the crabmeat grading system that we 
still use today; Capt. Eldridge Meredith, Sr., a waterman and 
entrepreneur who was honored as the 101st Admiral of the Chesapeake 
Bay, and Downes Curtis, one of the country's few Black sailmakers who 
was renowned for his skillful craftsmanship.
  They were descendants of the often-overlooked Black women, like Hazel 
Cropper, also known as ``Hurricane Hazel,'' who worked in the packing 
houses picking crabs, women who became the backbone of Maryland's crab 
meat industry.
  These Black Marylanders left a legacy of progress and success, but 
their stories also echo a system of inequality that exists today. Many 
of Maryland's Black watermen were redlined. They couldn't get loans. 
They weren't paid fairly. And they lacked access to capital to keep 
their businesses afloat when they suffered economic hardship.
  Maryland's congressional delegation has made Federal investments in 
historic preservation to ensure that Maryland's Black history is told 
because it has laid the foundation for Wes Moore, Maryland's first 
Black Governor; Adrienne Jones, Maryland's first Black speaker of the 
house of delegates; Anthony Brown, Maryland's first Black attorney 
general; Dereck Davis, Maryland's first Black State treasurer; and 
Brandon Scott, Baltimore's youngest Black mayor.
  Of course, Black leaders have not only contributed to Maryland, but 
to our Nation, like Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Defense 
Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, 
EPA Administrator Michael Regan, and OMB Director Shalanda Young. And 
now, we are proud to have our first Black woman on the Supreme Court, 
Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson and Black leaders have contributed around 
the world. And so, as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
I also want to take a moment to highlight the incredible contributions 
of Black Americans in U.S. foreign policy.
  Ebenezer Bassett, the first Black diplomat who served as Ambassador 
to Haiti from 1869 to 1877; Nobel Laureate Dr. Ralph Bunche, who 
mediated the 1949 Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement and fought for 
African independence; Ambassador Edward Perkins and Dr. Richard Hope, 
founders of the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship; Valerie 
Dickson-Horton, one of the first Black women to serve as a USAID 
Mission Director and Assistant Administrator; Peace Corps Director 
Aaron Williams; and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. Ambassador to the 
UN. These are pioneers and visionaries who have advanced our national 
security.
  The truth is that America's diverse talent pool is one of the most 
valuable assets we have on the global stage. And yet, in the last 20 
years, the number of Black employees at the State Department has 
decreased. It is why the Department, USAID, DFC, Peace Corps, and all 
of our international affairs Agencies must expand their diversity, 
equity, and inclusion efforts. And, following the tremendous efforts of 
Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, I am awaiting the announcement 
of the State Department's new chief diversity officer.
  Hard-won progress made thanks to the Rangel, Pickering, and Payne 
programs alongside paid internship programs must continue. Exchange 
programs and research partnerships with historically Black colleges and 
universities must grow. With four HBCUs in my State, I can personally 
attest to the brilliance and talent these institutions contribute to 
our Nation's global food, health, climate, economic, and other efforts 
which bolster national security.
  With the appointment of Desiree Cormier Smith as our Nation's first 
Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice, our Nation has 
also increased its efforts abroad. From the North American Partnership 
for Equity and Racial Justice Declaration to the UN International 
Decade for People of African Descent, our country is playing an 
important role in protecting the rights and recognizing the 
contributions of African descendants across the globe.
  At the Foreign Relations Committee, we now have our first director of 
diversity, equity, and inclusion--Dr. Mischa Thompson--to help advance 
these efforts in the Senate, our international Agencies, and across the 
globe. But we must all join this effort.
  And so, as we celebrate Black History Month, let us all recommit to 
fighting to overcome prejudice and oppression. Let us never give up 
hope that with determination and commitment, we can build the world Dr. 
King dreamed of--a fair world, a just world, a better world. We can do 
it as long as we remember what Ralph Bunche's said, that ``anything 
less than full equality is not enough.''

    TRIBUTE TO CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT OF THE AIR FORCE JOANNE S. BASS

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I rise to recognize and congratulate 
Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force JoAnne S. Bass on her upcoming 
retirement from the U.S. Air Force after 31 years of distinguished 
military service to our great Nation.
  As the 19th Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Chief Bass's 
unflagging

[[Page S440]]

leadership, relentless initiative, and trailblazing achievements as the 
highest ranking enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force from August 2020 
to March 2024 were vital in leading and developing 689,000 airmen. She 
used her unique perspective as an enlisted leader to guide and shape 
the Air Force during the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, the end of 
combat operations in Afghanistan, and through one of the most evolving 
and challenging strategic environments in modern history.
  As the senior enlisted adviser to the Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force, Chief Bass provided sound advice, perspective, and assistance on 
matters pertaining to enterprise management, enlisted heritage, force 
development, servicemember pay and compensation, and future force 
design. Through her expertise and collaborative efforts with her 
sister-service senior enlisted advisers, she ensured our Nation's land, 
sea, air, and space forces will continue to provide unmatched military 
capability to deter, dissuade, and defeat our enemies.
  Additionally, she directly influenced joint, interagency, and 
coalition teams to redesign and modernize air, space, and cyberspace 
organizations, resources, and training efforts with a renewed emphasis 
on enlisted empowerment.
  Chief Bass focused airmen on competition and innovation, accelerating 
the service's necessary transition into the Air Force of tomorrow. 
Through her reimagining of Air Force foundational documents, creation 
of the enlisted force development blueprint, and delivery of the first-
ever service manual of the joint team called ``The Purple Book,'' she 
revolutionized the recruiting, development and retention of the 
greatest talent our Nation has to offer: our people. Her legacy will be 
forever etched into the history of the Air Force as a changemaker 
during an incredibly consequential time for our country.
  I spent time with Chief Bass during our visit to Little Rock Air 
Force Base in Arkansas and at several Capitol Hill engagements as she 
encouraged congressional support to strengthen military readiness and 
achieve Air Force priorities. Airmen can be proud of her leadership and 
advocacy to ensure the United States maintains air superiority in this 
era of great power competition.
  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, the Senate Air Force Caucus, and a 
grateful nation, I extend my deepest appreciation to Chief Bass and her 
family for their many years of exemplary military service and 
sacrifice. I wish her nothing but the very best as she begins a new 
chapter.

                         TRIBUTE TO GRETA BROWN

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my sincere 
appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by Ms. Greta Brown 
during her four-decade tenure at the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, 
USSFCU. Greta has not only been a dedicated employee but has become an 
integral part of the fabric that binds our Senate community together.
  Since 1981, Greta has been a constant presence within the Senate 
office buildings, witnessing the growth of the USSFCU from a small 
institution to a vital financial resource for Senators, dignitaries, 
and congressional staff. Her ability to connect with members, provide 
insightful financial advice, and create meaningful relationships has 
shaped the perception of the credit union within the walls of our 
office buildings.
  Greta's journey is a testament to her commitment, professionalism, 
and the positive impact she has had on our community. She is a source 
of inspiration, always demonstrating dedication, poise, and flexibility 
in her tasks. Ambassador Alfonso E. Lenhardt rightly acknowledges her 
as one of the finest individuals, embodying the values that define our 
Senate community.
  Many who know Greta echo this sentiment, expressing gratitude for her 
astute financial advice. Greta's influence extends beyond her role, 
with many young staffers seeking her guidance as they navigate their 
financial journeys.
  In the spirit of ``people helping people,'' Greta has consistently 
served members with excellence and compassion. Her impact is evident in 
the numerous letters of appreciation she has received over the years. 
Greta is more than a colleague; she is a mentor, adviser, and friend to 
those fortunate enough to work alongside her.
  As the credit union approaches its 90th anniversary, Greta stands as 
a symbol of continuity, dedication, and the values that define our 
Senate and Capitol Hill community.
  In conclusion, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Greta Brown for her 
outstanding contributions to USSFCU and the broader Senate community. 
Her legacy will undoubtedly continue to resonate, inspiring us all to 
strive for excellence and service in our shared mission.

                         TRIBUTE TO JOE ARNOLD

  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today in celebration of Joe 
Arnold, head custodian at Hot Springs County School District No. 1 in 
Thermopolis, WY.
  Joe's career as a custodian in Wyoming schools spans 60 years. To 
honor this outstanding achievement, students, teachers, and 
administrators will gather on February 21, 2024, to celebrate the 
renaming of the central administration building to the Joe Arnold 
Central Administration Building.
  Joe was 21 years old in 1964 when he began as a custodian for Carbon 
County School District No. 1 in Rawlins, WY. After 22 years in Rawlins, 
Joe moved to Thermopolis, where he worked at Hamilton Dome Elementary 
School. When the elementary school closed, he transferred to the 
building that now bears his name. Joe's commitment to the school 
district and its students is unmatched. And his commitment to his 
community is unmistakable. It is not uncommon to see Joe shoveling snow 
before sunrise or escorting senior folks to the auditorium for events 
after school hours.
  Joe often invests the money he earns as a custodian back into his 
community. He pays for countless lunches and school field trips for 
students who cannot afford them. He has even helped with expenses for 
higher education. Joe's selflessness and generosity are unrivaled. He 
is the first to place a bid on auction items at fundraising events, 
then generously donates them back to be auctioned off again. Joe's true 
passion lies in helping students. As a mentor, he is always there to 
listen to their problems and offer advice whenever they need it. 
Graduation announcements and school photos from former students cover 
the walls of his office. After six decades of maintaining clean and 
healthy schools, Joe Arnold has no intention of retiring. However, as 
he arrives at work each day, Joe now sees his name on the building he 
works tirelessly to maintain.
  It is with great honor that I recognize the exemplary dedication of 
Joe Arnold. Hard work is the Wyoming way, and few work harder than Joe. 
My sincere congratulations to Joe Arnold as the Hot Springs County 
School District No. 1 Central Administration Building is renamed in his 
honor.

     REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 14064 OF FEBRUARY 11, 2022, WITH 
  RESPECT TO THE WIDESPREAD HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN--PM 37

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message

[[Page S441]]

from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to the widespread 
humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for a deepening 
economic collapse in Afghanistan declared in Executive Order 14064 of 
February 11, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond February 11, 2024.
  The widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan--including the 
urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, 
livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, and shelter 
and settlement assistance, among other basic human needs--and the 
potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States. In addition, the preservation of 
certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States 
by United States financial institutions is of the utmost importance to 
addressing this national emergency and the welfare of the people of 
Afghanistan. Various parties, including representatives of victims of 
terrorism, have asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB 
or indicated in public court filings an intent to make such claims. 
This property is blocked under Executive Order 14064.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14064 with respect to 
the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for 
a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, February 7, 2024.

     REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 14014 OF FEBRUARY 10, 2021, WITH 
                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 38

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with the provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
(stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in 
and in relation to Burma declared in Executive Order 14014 of February 
10, 2021, is to continue in effect beyond February 10, 2024.
  The situation in and in relation to Burma, and in particular the 
February 1, 2021 coup, in which the military overthrew the 
democratically elected civilian government of Burma and unjustly 
arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights 
defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, thereby rejecting the 
will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November 
2020 and undermining the country's democratic transition and rule of 
law, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 14014 with respect to Burma.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

                   DIVISION B--FEND OFF FENTANYL ACT

     SEC. 3001. SHORT TITLES.

       This division may be cited as the ``Fentanyl Eradication 
     and Narcotics Deterrence Off Fentanyl'' or the ``FEND Off 
     Fentanyl Act''.

     SEC. 3002. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the proliferation of fentanyl is causing an 
     unprecedented surge in overdose deaths in the United States, 
     fracturing families and communities, and necessitating a 
     comprehensive policy response to combat its lethal flow and 
     to mitigate the drug's devastating consequences;
       (2) the trafficking of fentanyl into the United States is a 
     national security threat that has killed hundreds of 
     thousands of United States citizens;
       (3) transnational criminal organizations, including cartels 
     primarily based in Mexico, are the main purveyors of fentanyl 
     into the United States and must be held accountable;
       (4) precursor chemicals sourced from the People's Republic 
     of China are--
       (A) shipped from the People's Republic of China by 
     legitimate and illegitimate means;
       (B) transformed through various synthetic processes to 
     produce different forms of fentanyl; and
       (C) crucial to the production of illicit fentanyl by 
     transnational criminal organizations, contributing to the 
     ongoing opioid crisis;
       (5) the United States Government must remain vigilant to 
     address all new forms of fentanyl precursors and drugs used 
     in combination with fentanyl, such as Xylazine, which 
     attribute to overdose deaths of people in the United States;
       (6) to increase the cost of fentanyl trafficking, the 
     United States Government should work collaboratively across 
     agencies and should surge analytic capability to impose 
     sanctions and other remedies with respect to transnational 
     criminal organizations (including cartels), including foreign 
     nationals who facilitate the trade in illicit fentanyl and 
     its precursors from the People's Republic of China; and
       (7) the Department of the Treasury should focus on fentanyl 
     trafficking and its facilitators as one of the top national 
     security priorities for the Department.

       This division may be cited as the ``Fentanyl Eradication 
     and Narcotics Deterrence Off Fentanyl'' or the ``FEND Off 
     Fentanyl Act''.

     SEC. 3002. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the proliferation of fentanyl is causing an 
     unprecedented surge in overdose deaths in the United States, 
     fracturing families and communities, and necessitating a 
     comprehensive policy response to combat its lethal flow and 
     to mitigate the drug's devastating consequences;
       (2) the trafficking of fentanyl into the United States is a 
     national security threat that has killed hundreds of 
     thousands of United States citizens;
       (3) transnational criminal organizations, including cartels 
     primarily based in Mexico, are the main purveyors of fentanyl 
     into the United States and must be held accountable;
       (4) precursor chemicals sourced from the People's Republic 
     of China are--
       (A) shipped from the People's Republic of China by 
     legitimate and illegitimate means;
       (B) transformed through various synthetic processes to 
     produce different forms of fentanyl; and
       (C) crucial to the production of illicit fentanyl by 
     transnational criminal organizations, contributing to the 
     ongoing opioid crisis;
       (5) the United States Government must remain vigilant to 
     address all new forms of fentanyl precursors and drugs used 
     in combination with fentanyl, such as Xylazine, which 
     attribute to overdose deaths of people in the United States;
       (6) to increase the cost of fentanyl trafficking, the 
     United States Government should work collaboratively across 
     agencies and should surge analytic capability to impose 
     sanctions and other remedies with respect to transnational 
     criminal organizations (including cartels), including foreign 
     nationals who facilitate the trade in illicit fentanyl and 
     its precursors from the People's Republic of China; and
       (7) the Department of the Treasury should focus on fentanyl 
     trafficking and its facilitators as one of the top national 
     security priorities for the Department.

                         HONORING TERRY LINDLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with Congressman Mike Thompson 
to recognize the enduring work of Terry Lindley on the occasion of his 
retirement from Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) Board of Trustees 
after thirty years of supporting higher education.
  Raised on a family ranch in Humboldt County, Terry developed an early 
appreciation for agriculture and respect for the community who farms 
it. While attending Ferndale High School, Terry met the agriculture 
instructor, Steve Olson, who became a trusted friend and mentor 
throughout his life. After graduating high school, Terry studied 
agricultural business at Santa Rosa Junior College while living with 
Steve and his wife in 1976. Steve, who eventually became Chairman of 
the Agriculture Department and the Dean of the College, provided 
counsel and guidance as Terry embarked on a distinguished career 
focusing on community leadership and agriculture.
  After earning his degree, Terry was hired as a loan officer and 
appraiser at American AgCredit. Terry's excellence in agricultural 
business promoted him to many executive positions throughout his forty-
year career, including senior vice president and chief marketing 
officer. Terry's aptitude for hard work, deep understanding of 
agriculture, and business acumen made him a remarkable pioneer in the 
agricultural business industry, establishing the first marketing 
department in the Farm Credit System.
  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Terry has made many 
enduring and positive impacts on the community during his decades of 
public service. For 30 years, Terry has been a trustee of Santa Rosa 
Junior College where he has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to 
providing high-quality education to the next generations of leaders in 
the North Bay. While he will be greatly missed in his retirement, 
Terry's enduring legacy will be remembered by the Lindley Center for 
STEM Education, a new facility to provide hands-on learning activities 
to support students in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics.
  Terry has demonstrated a lifelong dedication to supporting 
agriculture and future agricultural leaders. He has been awarded 
numerous accolades in recognition of his service, including the SRJC's 
President's Medallion, 4-H Foundation's Shining Star Award, the Spirit 
of Sonoma County Award, and Sonoma County's North Bay Rancher of the 
Year award.
  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Terry Lindley has been an excellent 
steward of the Santa Rosa Junior College and a dedicated community 
member of Sonoma County. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor him here today.

                          ____________________

                    RECOGNIZING COLONEL LEE R. BOUMA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. CLIFF BENTZ

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Lee R. 
Bouma, United States Air Force, for his exceptional dedication and 
selfless service to the United States of America. Colonel Bouma retired 
on November 6, 2024, from his current assignment as Commander of the 
173d Fighter Wing at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon. We thank 
him for his commitment to our country over the past 27 years.
  Colonel Bouma graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 
1997. His service includes Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Vance Air 
Force Base in Oklahoma, Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, and Balad Air 
Base in Iraq. In 2015, Colonel Bouma was stationed at Kingsley Field. 
After serving in several positions at Kingsley Field, he earned the 
Command of the 173rd Fighter Wing in 2022.
  Kingsley Field serves as a critical asset for American national 
security as it serves as an outstanding training center for the Air 
National Guard and active-duty pilots. In his time as Commander, 
Kingsley Field was selected as the next F-35A Lightning II training 
squadron. Colonel Bouma has ensured that Kingsley Field will continue 
to be an integral piece of the Air Force's modernization plans, 
continuing their legacy of training the next generation of fighter 
pilots. As commander, Colonel Bouma commanded the sole F-15C Formal 
Training Unit in the United States Air Force, led over 1,050 personnel, 
and was responsible for overseeing a total inventory of 23 F-15 
aircraft and managing 26 primary assigned aircraft. Colonel Bouma has 
flown over 2,200 hours in multiple aircraft, including the F-16 and F-
15, and has achieved the rating of Senior Pilot. Colonel Bouma's 
impressive operational experience includes flying 22 combat sorties in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, amassing over 75 hours of combat 
flight time. His contributions to international operations include 
serving as an F-15C Instructor Pilot in the Netherlands and supporting 
contingencies in South Korea. Colonel Bouma has been awarded the 
Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Air Medal, the Air 
Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Achievement Medal. Colonel 
Bouma embodies the Air Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service 
Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do as Commander, leader, and 
Airman.
  As our nation continues to face challenges around the world, no 
matter the trials and uncertainty that might come our way, we have 
confidence in the leadership of those who have served our country, and 
we owe a debt of gratitude to Colonel Bouma. His dedication to training 
the next generation of pilots and ensuring the readiness of our forces 
reflects the highest ideals of military service.
  Colonel Bouma has dedicated his life to serving this nation, and we 
thank him. We thank him for his proud service, vision, leadership, and 
gratitude demonstrated both at home and abroad. As we reach the 
culmination of his distinguished career, I join my colleagues today and 
congratulate Colonel Bouma for a lifetime of service to his country. We 
wish him, and his wife Laureen, and his children Ashley, Kamron, and 
Brant the best wishes as he retires from the United States Air Force.

                          ____________________

           STANDING WITH CHAR BAR IN COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, America stands in solidarity 
with Char Bar, which, as the only kosher restaurant in DC, was the 
target of antisemitic vandalism right on the eve of the 86th 
anniversary of Kristallnacht. Although the purpose of the attack was to 
strike terror in the heart of the Jewish community, the leadership and 
loyal clientele of Char Bar refuses to be cowered by hate. It has no 
intention of shying away from its proud Jewish identity.
  An attack on Char Bar as a Jewish business is an attack on all of us. 
Every American has a moral obligation to fight antisemitism whenever, 
wherever, and among whomever it appears. The Jewish diaspora should 
have no greater friend than the United States of America.

                       HONORING MS. ESSIE NORRIS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ms. Essie Norris for her over 
thirty years of dedicated volunteer service with incarcerated women and 
men at the Alexandria City Jails. Ms. Norris was drawn to the jail 
ministry by a powerful scripture in Matthew 25:43-45, where Jesus said, 
``I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me 
not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.'' This scripture 
served as a clear call to action for her. In 1992, when Elsie Taylor 
Jordan, a prominent community leader and Sheriff with the Alexandria 
City Police Department, launched the Prison Ministry at a Women's 
church meeting at Ebenezer Baptist Church in 1992, Ms. Norris 
immediately joined to support the mission. The ministry's goal was to 
remind the inmates that, despite their circumstances, they were not 
forgotten by God and that a community of faith was there to encourage

[[Page E1124]]

them through their time in the Alexandria Jail. A year later, her 
sister and daughter joined her, singing, praying, and testifying about 
God to the incarnated men and women there, and together, they have 
continued to carry this legacy of service on.
  Initially, the ministry visited every Sunday, with Essie pouring her 
heart into the work. As other community ministries emerged, the 
Ebenezer Baptist Church scaled back visiting twice a month, and now 
they visit once a month. One of the most memorable experiences for Ms. 
Norris and her family was their visit to Lorton Prison with the 
Missionaries of Ebenezer Baptist Church--an experience that profoundly 
shaped them.
  Today, I am honored to recognize and celebrate Ms. Essie Norris for 
her work as a Prison Ministry. Her work has made a lasting impact in 
Northern Virginia and is a testament to her dedicated faith.

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of a grateful 
Nation and the Citizens of the Twenty-Fourth District of Texas. The 
2024 Congressional Veteran Commendation is hereby presented to Robert 
G. Briggs, Staff Sergeant, United States Army, of Keller, Texas for his 
honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States of America 
and for his continued service to his community.
  Mr. Briggs enlisted in the United States Army in 2003, serving as a 
signal intelligence analyst, with a combat deployment to Afghanistan. 
During his deployment he served as a low-level voice intercept team 
leader in remote areas of Afghanistan, supporting an infantry unit with 
signals intelligence collection and engaged in numerous firefights with 
insurgent forces.
  Mr. Briggs' decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, the 
Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, the NATO Afghanistan 
Service Medal, the Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal (2nd 
Award), the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Reserve Component 
Overseas Training Ribbon, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with M Device, 
and the Combat Action Badge.
  His dedication to service does not stop with his time in the 
military. He is a public servant to the City of Southlake, serving as 
the Deputy Director of Economic Development & Tourism, and has worked 
tirelessly to establish a Veteran's Recognition Program for the city. 
He also volunteers as a youth baseball and soccer coach, serves at the 
Tarrant County Food Bank, and works in numerous capacities at St. Ann 
Catholic Parish.
  Mr. Briggs' service is consistent with the finest traditions of the 
United States Army and reflects great credit upon himself, the State of 
Texas, and the United States of America.

    RECOGNIZING MANDY GREWAL'S LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE TO PITTSFIELD 
                                TOWNSHIP

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mandy Grewal, 
Supervisor of Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan, on the occasion of 
her retirement. Her decades of public service to the residents of 
Pittsfield Township and Washtenaw County are worthy of commendation.
  Mandy was born in Chandigarh, India as the youngest of three 
children. Her father, a Brigadier General in the Indian Army who she 
describes as the ``original feminist'', and her mother encouraged Mandy 
and her sister, in the early 1990's, to move to the United States so 
they could pursue their graduate studies. Mandy graduated with a 
Master's degree in Development, Trade & Planning from Eastern Michigan 
University. She went on to work as an Institutional Research Analyst at 
EMU before moving to the Great Lakes Commission where she found her 
passion for environmental preservation. This led to her pursuing a 
doctoral degree in Urban Planning at the University of Michigan.
  After graduating with her doctoral degree in 2004, Mandy became 
active with the Washtenaw County Democratic Party and was appointed to 
the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners in April 2006. Mandy 
campaigned for her first election later that year and was elected to 
the position of Pittsfield Charter Township Supervisor. She was the 
first woman and first person of color elected to the township 
supervisor's position and said she is proud to have been a part of a 
diversification of the township board, now majority women and among the 
most racially diverse elected bodies in the county.
  Along with cultivating a culture of team work at Township Hall, Mandy 
credits her many successes to the partnerships she nurtured in the 
community, not just with Pittsfield residents but also through her 
civic engagement at Ann Arbor SPARK, Michigan Association of Planning, 
Washtenaw Area Transportation Study, Ann Arbor Area Transportation 
Authority, SAFE House Center, Therapeutic Riding Inc., Urban County, 
and the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. Some notable 
accomplishments under her tenure include pioneering multimodal 
transportation in the Township by installing connecting sidewalks, bike 
lanes, and improving public transportation. She also was crucial in 
Canton acquiring over $60 million in grant funding to push through such 
legacy projects as the Public Safety Building improvements and Michigan 
Avenue reconstruction. Outside of her position as Supervisor, Mandy 
serves as Chairperson of the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments 
(SEMCOG) where she is also a member of both the Executive Committee and 
the Finance & Budget Committee. In 2021, she was appointed by the 
Governor to serve on the Michigan Municipal Services Authority and in 
2022 was appointed to the Board of the Michigan Planning Association.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the 
tremendous career of Mandy Grewal. Under Mandy's leadership, Pittsfield 
Township has become an example of how inclusive, respectful, and 
transparent planning practices, undertaken with patience and 
consistency, can yield a physical and cultural landscape that is both 
sustainable and equitable. I thank Mandy and we are excited to see what 
she accomplishes in her next chapter.

                          ____________________

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the K9 Hurricane's 
Heroes for all the work they have done providing service to our 
nation's four legged heroes. Through the years, we have seen working 
dogs bring criminals to justice and serving alongside our 
servicemembers in uniform keeping our country safe. In 2014, secret 
service canine Hurricane stopped an intruder on the White House lawn 
and was awarded the Medal of Valor for it. Shortly after, K9 
Hurricane's Heroes was established sponsoring 140 retired working dogs 
from the United States Secret Service, police departments, all five of 
our armed service branches and other government institutions. This 
organization makes sure that their service isn't forgotten and gets 
them the help they need to live long, happy lives after retirement. I 
thank them for helping our service dog heroes and keep up the great 
work. God bless K9 Hurricane's Heroes and God bless the United States 
of America.

                     HONORING SUPERVISOR JIM HOLMES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LaMALFA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr.  LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the two decades of public 
service of Supervisor Jim Holmes for the people of Placer County and 
Northern California.
  Jim's roots run deep in Northern California, having descended from 
two of Placer County's pioneer families. His maternal great great-
grandfather came to Placer County from Massachusetts in 1853 to settle 
and search for gold while his paternal great grandfather traveled west 
from Iowa and settled in Ophir, California in 1864 becoming an 
orchardist growing: pears, apples, cherries and peaches.
  Jim was born in Auburn, California. He would attend Placer High 
School and Sierra College; he would then go on to receive a Bachelor's 
Degree in Political Science from Humboldt State University in 1973. To 
help pay for his education, Jim worked at a gas station and auto repair 
facility.
  Jim would go on to open his own auto repair shop, which he owned and 
managed for nearly 30 years. As a young business owner, Jim joined many 
community service organizations including the Auburn Area Chamber of 
Commerce, becoming a founding member of the Highway 49 Business 
Association and the North Auburn Municipal Advisory Board.
  Due to his community leadership and involvement, Jim was asked to run 
for the Placer Consolidated Fire Protection District Board

[[Page E1125]]

of Directors, where he would serve the community for 18 years. Jim 
would also serve concurrently as a Trustee of the Auburn Union 
Elementary School District for 8 years.
  In 2003, Jim was approached by community members of North Auburn and 
Auburn to run for the Placer County Board of Supervisors. Jim was 
elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2004 where he would serve the 
next 5 terms as Supervisor.
  As Supervisor, Jim was deeply involved in the advocacy of rural 
counties and representing the interests of Placer County. From the very 
beginning of his tenure, Jim served on: Rural County Representatives of 
California (RCRC), Placer County Transportation Planning Agency 
(PCTPA), Air Pollution Control District Board, Criminal Justice Policy 
Committee, Area 4 Agency on Aging Advisory/Governing/JPA Boards, as 
well as many other committees and governing groups. Additionally, Jim 
has served as the Placer County Supervisor's Chairman of the Board in 
2008, 2013, 2018, and 2023.
  Jim and his wife, Pat, have three children: Stacy, Amy, and John, 
along with four grandchildren: Amber, Mandy, Lyla, and Mia.
  We thank Supervisor Jim Holmes for his work to represent the good 
people of Placer County, and his many years of hard work promoting a 
pro-business and pro-agriculture sentiments to the Board of 
Supervisors. We wish him all the best in his retirement.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today, I am recognizing the men and women 
of Delta Company, 114th Infantry Regiment from Woodstown, South Jersey. 
As they embark on their deployment, I want to thank them for their 
sacrifice to serve the people of New Jersey and the United States of 
America. The men and women from Delta Company who have come before them 
have left a great legacy for them to follow. Going back to the 1860s, 
their predecessors played a vital part in ending the American Civil 
War, contributing to the Confederate States surrender at Appomattox, 
ending the war, ending slavery, and reuniting our great country. Since 
then, Delta Company has served in both World Wars, the Global War on 
Terrorism, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. As they prepare for their 
deployment, I hope they remember the great men and women who have come 
before them and be proud that they are carrying on that invaluable 
tradition. Godspeed and God bless Delta Company, and God bless the 
United States of America.

        HONORING VFW POST 51 SPOKANE CHAPLAIN WESLEY S. ANDERSON

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an 
extraordinary individual who has dedicated his life to the principle of 
``honoring the dead by caring for the living.'' Chaplain Wesley S. 
``Wes'' Anderson of VFW Post 51 in Spokane, Washington, has committed 
decades of service to ensuring that veterans, both past and present, 
are remembered, respected, and supported in every way possible.
  Chaplain Anderson began his journey of service as a Hospital Corpsman 
with the 3rd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force in Vietnam from 1966 
to 1969. Upon returning home, he joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars at 
Post 7480 in Davenport, Washington. Since then, he has dedicated more 
than five decades to supporting his fellow veterans through various 
roles including Post Commander, Post Chaplain, District Commander, and 
State Chaplain. Through his current roles as Chaplain, Service Officer, 
and Judge Advocate of VFW Post 51 in Spokane, he has continually 
demonstrated a profound commitment to veterans and their families.
  Chaplain Anderson's dedication to honoring the dead is evident in his 
ongoing engagement in memorials that respect and commemorate veterans 
who have passed, providing solemn and respectful services that give 
peace to families and uphold the honor of those who have served. He 
serves as Chaplain on call at the Washington State Veterans Cemetery in 
Medical Lake, Washington, and has participated in the Missing in 
America Program, which ensures that unclaimed veterans receive a proper 
and dignified burial.
  At the same time, Chaplain Anderson has devoted himself to caring for 
the living, particularly in times of isolation and need. In 2020, as 
the COVID-19 pandemic restricted visits at the Spokane Veterans Home, 
Chaplain Anderson launched the ``Valentines for Veterans'' initiative. 
Knowing how a simple card could brighten a lonely day, he worked with 
local organizations to bring heartfelt Valentine's Day messages to 
residents. The initiative quickly grew, sending a powerful message that 
these veterans remain valued and respected. For Chaplain Anderson, this 
program was driven by a commitment to let veterans know they are still 
cherished and valued members of the community.
  Chaplain Anderson's service extends to his work with the Veterans 
Service Center in Spokane Valley, where he brings comfort and support 
to veterans transitioning back to civilian life. A certified drug and 
alcohol counselor and tireless advocate for the prevention of veteran 
suicide, he offers specialized assistance to veterans in need, meeting 
them with understanding and compassion.
  Mr. Speaker, Chaplain Wes Anderson stands as a shining example of 
what it means to honor the dead by caring for the living. His 
compassion and dedication have touched the lives of countless veterans 
and families, ensuring that they know they are not forgotten. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Chaplain Anderson's extraordinary 
service and legacy.
  May his example inspire us all to continue the important work of 
supporting our veterans, caring for those in need, and honoring the 
memory of those who have served.

the community, earning him the DAR Medal of Honor.
  Major General Simpson's service is consistent with the finest 
traditions of the United States Air Force and reflects great credit

     HONORING DR. MIKE GALIAZZO, A 2024 MARYLAND MANUFACTURING STAR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. STENY H. HOYER

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend and great 
Marylander: Dr. Mike Galiazzo. He was recently named a 2024 Maryland 
Manufacturing Star by the Regional Manufacturing Institute (RMI) of 
Maryland and the Maryland Manufacturing Extension Partnership. I hope 
all my colleagues will join me in celebrating him for this achievement.
  I've long calied Mike `the Godfather of Maryland Manufacturing'--and 
for good reason. He was the one who founded RMI in the first place, 35 
years ago, outlining its mission `to advocate for Maryland 
manufacturing and help companies grow and be competitive.' He's brought 
together leaders from private industry, labor, education, and local, 
state, and federal government to make progress toward that goal. From 
helping students and young Marylanders build successful careers in the 
field to incentivizing manufacturers to set up shop in Maryland, Mike 
has devoted his life to creating new opportunities for our state's 
workers and businesses to get ahead.
  Mike has also been an extraordinary supporter of the Make it in 
America agenda I launched back in 2010 to ensure that the American 
economy can meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and 
continue to outcompete the rest of the world. From the start, 
manufacturing has been a cornerstone of that agenda. He and I have 
worked to provide our workers, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers the 
tools and opportunities they need to Make it in America--and Make it in 
Maryland. Mike's work is especially crucial at a time when we are 
implementing the historic CHIPS and Science Act and ensuring that this 
once-in-a-generation investment in manufacturing reaches every corner 
of our state and country.
  Mike's advocacy is more than just his work; it's his calling. He 
believes--as I do--that America is a nation of builders. American 
factories churned out the innovations that led to tremendous 
improvements in quality of life around the globe; that defeated the 
forces of fascism and authoritarianism; that turned our country into 
the greatest economic powerhouse in the history of the world. American 
strength and prosperity depend on American manufacturing, and, Mr. 
Speaker, American manufacturing depends on tireless, principled 
advocates like Dr. Mike Galiazzo.
  I ask that all my colleagues join me in honoring Mike for receiving 
this award and in thanking him for his indelible contributions to 
Maryland and America.

his long career working at Olin Chemical Plant before retiring after 33 
years of service.
  A devout Christian, John was a dedicated member of St. John the 
Apostle Church and volunteered at many church picnics and was the

     RECOGNIZING PATRICIA SCRIBNER'S SERVICE TO PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Patricia 
Scribner, Treasurer of Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan, on the 
occasion of her retirement. Her decades of public service to the 
residents of Pittsfield Township and Washtenaw County are worthy of 
commendation.
  Patricia got her start in local politics when she joined the 
Washtenaw County Parks & Recreation Commission in 1989. She is still a 
member and has been serving as the commission's Vice President since 
2007. A resident of Pittsfield Charter Township for thirty years, she 
has been the Township Treasurer since 2008.
  Patricia's time as the Township Treasurer has been a boon for the 
Township and the surrounding areas. Under her direction, the Treasurers 
Office set a higher standard for fiduciary responsibility, resulting in 
Standard & Poor's Bond Rating for the Township being upgraded by two 
steps to AA+. They also implemented additional tax payment options, 
updated software programs to increase efficiency, and implemented an 
online payment system for Parks and Rec programs. She has earned the 
Michigan Certified Professional Treasurer (MiCPT), credential certified 
by the Michigan Municipal Treasurers Association (MMTA) in 2011. 
Patricia has continued to maintain her credential as a MiCPT through a 
yearly MMTA program accredited by Central Michigan University and 
through additional treasury-specific education offered by the MMTA.
  Outside of her work with the Treasurer's Office, Patricia also serves 
on Pittsfield Charter Township's Board of Trustees, Washtenaw County 
Treasurers Association, Washtenaw County Parks & Recreation Commission, 
Pittsfield Historic District Commission, and the Arts & Culture 
Excellence in Pittsfield Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the 
tremendous career of Patricia Scribner. Her dedication to her community 
and determination to be the best Treasurer she can be is a shining 
example of what we should expect from our elected officials. I thank 
her for her service and wish her the best as she opens up the next 
chapter of her life. I thank Patricia.

          HONORING CLOVERLEIGH FARM FOR 10 YEARS OF OPERATION

                                 ______

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 10 years of 
operation for Cloverleigh Farm of Columbia, Connecticut. Cloverleigh 
Farm is owned and operated by Susan Mitchell. Susan's remarkable 
leadership and tireless work ethic has grown the farm into a staple of 
eastern Connecticut agriculture. Cloverleigh's success is inseparable 
from Susan's.
  Susan's agricultural journey started in the State of New York. She 
taught science in Cornwall, New York, a town in the center of the 
Hudson Valley which is dense with small, sustainable farms. Susan's 
love for cultivation was apparent even before officially becoming a 
farmer. As a science teacher, Susan transformed her environmental 
science classes into an army of horticulturalists. Using Cornwall High 
School's garden, Susan taught her students how to seriously tend to the 
land. The fruits of the school garden were sold to the school's 
cafeteria as ingredients and donated to a food pantry in the town over. 
She then began farming in New York's Hudson Valley before moving to 
Connecticut in 2010 and starting Cloverleigh Farm in 2014.
  Her gift for agriculture and support for her community has become 
infectious since she planted her roots, literally and figuratively, in 
our State. Susan became a founding member of the New Connecticut Farmer 
Alliance, a member and leading advocate of the National Young Farmers 
Coalition. She is also a member of the Northeast Organic Farming 
Association of Connecticut as well as the Connecticut Farm Bureau.
  Susan has trekked down to Washington to advocate for issues 
pertaining to young and beginning farmers, including the crucial issues 
of land access, support for organic operations, access to capital for 
young and beginning farmers, and student loan forgiveness. She works 
with local school districts, including that of my hometown, Vernon, to 
supply the produce for their farm to school programs. Susan has 
participated in novel approaches to getting nutritious food out to the 
community, including the Healthy PlanEat food delivery box program, and 
participating in annual ``Know Your Farmer Fair'' events. Most 
importantly, I have had the pleasure of being a customer of her produce 
at a local farmer's market. The carrots, radishes and melons she grows 
are the best.
  Community lays at the center of Susan's agricultural vision. Just as 
the Cornwall school garden gave back to the community which fostered 
it, Cloverleigh has time and time again

[[Page E1127]]

reinvested into the eastern Connecticut community. After years of 
farming in Columbia, CT, Susan finally owns land of her own in 
Columbia. During my many visits to Susan's farms, I've had the 
privilege of seeing firsthand the care and love she puts into farming. 
She has introduced me to UConn students who are working with her and 
bringing that knowledge back to the university; she has been a tireless 
advocate for the needs of small, new and beginning, and specialty crop 
growers; and her friendly demeanor and tenacious spirit have driven her 
to this incredible milestone of 10 years in operation.
  I congratulate Susan on this incredible achievement. I am indelibly 
grateful for her advocacy and support for the community, and I wish her 
the best as she embarks on the next decade of this farm.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
La Quinta de Los Reyes in Aurora, Illinois, for being named the 2024 
Small Business of the Year by the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce. This award is a testament to the restaurant's dedication to 
exceptional service, cultural enrichment, and community engagement,
  Established in 2003 by Jesus Sanchez, an immigrant from Durango, 
Mexico, La Quinta de Los Reyes began as a family dream that has since 
become a culinary cornerstone of the Aurora community. Since 2014, 
together with his partner Claudia Urrutia, also an immigrant from 
Durango, Mexico they have overseen the growth of this business creating 
an atmosphere that celebrates Hispanic culture and traditions, while 
demonstrating a commitment to fostering inclusivity, supporting local 
events, and giving back to the community.
  Beyond its culinary offerings, La Quinta de Los Reyes hosts 
traditional celebrations, such as Reyes Magos, gifting thousands of 
toys to children in the community, and Dia de Los Ninos, bringing 
families together for a fun-filled day of children's activities and 
delicious food.
  Located at 36 East New York Street, La Quinta de Los Reyes occupies a 
historic building that dates back to the 1820s. This site has evolved 
over the years, from housing a shoe store and the Grand Lodge of the 
Knights and Ladies of Honor, to hosting Jacob Bellon's German Tavern in 
the early 1900s. Today, La Quinta de Los Reyes exemplifies the 
entrepreneurial spirit that makes small businesses the lifeblood of our 
economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have a family enterprise like La Quinta de 
Los Reyes in my district, to serve as a reminder of the essential role 
that Hispanic-owned businesses play in shaping the economic and 
cultural fabric of our Nation. I invite my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Jesus Sanchez, Claudia Urrutia, and their entire family 
and team on this well-deserved honor.

   CELEBRATING DELBERT KOHLER'S 50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY AT DAVIS MACHINE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Delbert 
Kohler's 50-year anniversary at Davis Machine, a manufacturing company 
based in Texas's 24th Congressional District. Delbert began his career 
at Davis Machine in 1974 and has consistently demonstrated immense 
dedication and talent.
  Davis Machine built a solid reputation among its customers as a high-
quality production facility, originally producing a limited range of 
parts in low volumes. Seeking to expand its capabilities to produce 
more complex components, the company purchased an Okuma LB-15 lathe 
equipped with Computer Numerical Control (CNC) technology. This 
transformed the business from a manual machine shop to a CNC-driven 
facility. As one of the company's most trusted experts on manual 
lathes, Delbert was chosen to become the CNC lathe programmer.
  A master craftsman, Delbert has been instrumental in transforming the 
business into a high-volume production shop that continues to serve its 
valued customers. In 2014, he played a key role in The University of 
Texas at Arlington's project for the school's FSAE racing team and has 
trained thousands ofemployees over the years.
  I would like to congratulate Delbert on his 50th anniversary with the 
Davis Machine family and wish him the best as he continues to help this 
high-tech operation thrive in North Texas.

military. He coaches youth football, volunteers with schools and boy

volunteers to clean up trash alongside the road in his community. 
Colonel Tade sponsors ride-along flights for future pilots at the Grand 
Prairie Airport-as well as hosts tours for students interested in

  Colonel Tade's service is consistent with the finest traditions of

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the honor of having a flag 
flown over the United States Capitol for the re-dedication of the 
Fourth Degree St. Vincent Pallotti, Assembly 680 of the Knights of 
Columbus for their new location in Hammonton, South Jersey. For nearly 
150 years, the Knights of Columbus have been a beacon of true brotherly 
love by showing God's power in men of the Catholic faith. St. Vincent 
boasts of having the fourth degree, the most prestigious members of the 
order, all of them obtaining the title of ``Sir Knight.'' It is the 
highest degree and extension of the third with the primary objective 
being to ``foster the spirit of patriotism and to encourage active 
Catholic Citizenship''. I salute the men of the Fourth Degree at St. 
Vincent Pallotti, Assembly 680 on doing an exemplary job of serving God 
through the Catholic faith and being outstanding patriots to our great 
Nation. May God bless Fourth Degree St. Vincent Pallotti Assembly 680 
and God bless the United States of America.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure to present Petty 
Officer Second Class Ann Petronaci with the Quilt of Valor in Little 
Egg Harbor Township, South Jersey. Ann valiantly served our country for 
seven years in the United States Navy as a Radio woman, playing a 
crucial role transmitting and receiving radio signals both onshore and 
at sea. The Radio woman was one of the most important roles in the U.S. 
military, as the success of missions heavily relied on effective 
communication between units. At the time,

[[Page E1128]]

radio technology was extraordinarily hard to maintain due to the 
limited advancements that we now have today. Despite this, Ann 
persevered and made sure that the units she served with received the 
necessary communication needed to complete missions across the globe. 
She spent a big part of her time away from her family, spending time 
stationed on military bases in Spain and Germany, but Petty Officer 
Second Class Petronaci honorably served her time and was discharged in 
1982. I want to thank Ann for her distinguished years of service to our 
country. God bless Ann and God bless the United States of America.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor of attending the 
Eagle Scout ceremony for an extraordinary young man in Kyler Campsmith. 
Kyler comes from a legacy of Eagle Scouts in his family and has been 
involved in scouts since the first grade. Since that time, he has been 
involved in a variety of leadership roles to include patrol leader, 
senior patrol, and troop guide where he displayed his gift for teaching 
by being exceptionally patient with the younger scouts. For his eagle 
scout project, Kyler demonstrated his love for God by building a Gaga 
ball pit for the youth ministry for Wellspring Church of which he is a 
member and plays guitar for the worship team. Kyler is also a 
tremendous athlete playing both varsity basketball and baseball at the 
Pilgrim Academy in Mays Landing, South Jersey where he will graduate 
from in June. He works exceptionally hard outside of boy scouts working 
as a lifeguard and will continue to work at the Ocean City Waterpark 
this summer until he begins pursuing his dream. He has always dreamed 
of becoming an electrical line worker and once he graduates from the 
Pilgrim Academy, he will begin the path toward achieving it. I have no 
doubt that Kyler will be successful in whatever endeavor he decides to 
pursue and will continue to be an invaluable member of his community. 
God bless Kyler Campsmith and God bless the United States of America.

2024 Congressional Veteran Commendation is hereby presented to Bradley 
Linch, Specialist, United States Army, of Southlake, Texas for his 
honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States of America,

back out to Mr. Linch, and after correspondence, a Senate investigation 
paved the way for more nutritious food to be served at dining 
facilities across the Army.
  Mr. Linch's decorations include the National Defense Service Medal, 
the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, and the Army 
Service Medal.
  His dedication to service does not stop with his time in the 
military. He currently serves as a mentor to students on financial

Matter International local chapter, and has coached youth sports for 
ten seasons with the Miracle League of Southlake. He is also a member 
of the American Legion and a graduate of the Southlake Citizens 
Academy.
  Mr. Linch's service is consistent with the finest traditions of the 
United States Army and reflects great credit upon himself, the State of 
Texas, and the United States of America.

         RECOGNIZING METRA COMMUTER RAILROAD'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DELIA C. RAMIREZ

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Metra and all 
its employees on their 40th anniversary of delivering public 
transportation services for the communities in Illinois' 3rd 
Congressional District and beyond.
  Metra is essential to our work in Illinois to build a strong, vibrant 
regional economy. Public transportation connects residents of Illinois' 
3rd Congressional District to high-quality jobs, public amenities, and 
local businesses, from DuPage County to downtown Chicago and beyond.
  When public transportation provides reliable, affordable, and 
accessible service, the benefits go beyond economic development and 
opportunity. We can achieve cleaner environments, better family health 
outcomes, and safer communities.
  This is why I am proud to have secured $8 million in federal funds 
from the Department of Transportation's Rail Crossing Elimination 
program to support the separation of train traffic from pedestrians and 
cars in the Franklin Park community in my district--a project that will 
improve safety and mobility for local residents in my district.
  As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Metra and its commuter rail 
service, I will continue advocating for policies and investments that 
support public transit improvements, strengthen green, resilient 
infrastructure, and expand choice and equity in our transportation 
systems.
  I thank Metra, for their service to connecting our communities. Let's 
continue rolling together towards a bright future.

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize the 50th wedding anniversary of Tom and Cindy McLeod.
  George Thomas McLeod, Jr. was born in Birmingham, Alabama on January 
3, 1953, to George Thomas McLeod and Marie White McLeod. Cynthia Diane 
McAuley was born in Mobile, Alabama, on August 30, 1954, to Claude 
Ewing McAuley and Barbara Delores McAuley. When Cindy was in elementary 
school, her family moved to Birmingham.
  Tom and Cindy attended Shades Valley High School and that's where 
their love story began. Tom graduated in 1971 and stayed in Birmingham 
to work for the family business. Cindy graduated in 1973 and briefly 
attended classes at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, before Tom 
convinced her to move back to Birmingham. He sold his motorcycle to buy 
her an engagement ring and she said yes.
  They married on November 2, 1974, at Trinity United Methodist Church 
in Birmingham. They started a family in 1978 with the birth of a son, 
Christopher Neal McLeod. Chris is married to Joanna Mazzone of Pelham, 
and they have two sons: Caden Thomas (13) and Coker Neal (10). Their 
daughter, Kimberly Lynn McLeod, was born in 1982. Kim is married to Dr. 
John Flannagan of Anniston, and they have one son: Will Rivers (8).
  Fifty years later, Tom and Cindy enjoy spending time with friends and 
family, traveling in their RV, bird watching, yardwork and attending 
their grandsons' sporting events. Tom also enjoys golfing while Cindy 
serves her friends and family and rescues stray animals.
  The McLeod's attend Double Oak Community Church in Mt. Laurel and are 
members of Greystone Golf & Country Club. They celebrated their 50th 
anniversary with friends and family at Greystone Country Club Legacy, 
with a surprise party hosted by their children and their spouses on 
Saturday, November 2, 2024.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing this milestone and wishing 
them a happy 50th anniversary.

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steven Sneideman 
of Canton, Michigan, on the occasion of his retirement from Canton 
Township's Board of Trustees. His dedication to his community during a 
career of service is worthy of commendation.
  Steven started out his education career by earning his Bachelor's 
degree in economics from Harvard University and a Master of Business 
Administration from New York University. Steven moved to Canton in 1994 
and over the

[[Page E1129]]

last three decades has held multiple positions helping the Canton 
community. He served on the Partnership for the Art Board and the 
Plymouth-Canton School Board from 2006 to 2012, where he was President 
for two years. While on the board, Steven was instrumental in diversity 
and inclusion programs at Plymouth-Canton Community Schools and adding 
Chinese Language to the curriculum.
  After his time on the Partnership for the Art and School Boards, 
Steven was elected to Canton's Board of Trustees in 2016. He has been 
instrumental in the passing of the Human Rights ordinance, as well as 
the Canton roads program and the balancing of the township budget. In 
recognition of his hard work and dedication to his community, Steven 
was inducted into the Canton Hall of Fame in 2019 as a resident that 
has supported the community for many years. From preserving green 
spaces to addressing deteriorating and crowded roads and ensuring equal 
rights for all that live there, Steven has consistently showed the love 
that he has for his community. Presently, Steven is the Chairman of the 
Canton Community Foundation and has led the foundation in offering 
scholarships to students, providing grants to organizations for local 
youth and seniors, as well as veteran support. Steven has done all this 
while balancing being a global program manager for AT&T and a dedicated 
family man to his wife, Kelli, and his two daughters, Maggie and Emily.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the 
tremendous career of Steven Sneideman as he continues to be a pillar of 
the Canton community and is a beloved friend and neighbor. I thank 
Steven.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I want to remember Jaci Bobbitt, an 
incredible resident of South Jersey and a great friend of mine. Jaci 
lived a remarkable life, starting in Portsmouth, Ohio before attending 
West Virginia University, where she met her husband, John. Her vibrant 
personality kept her social calendar full, allowing her to enjoy 
quality time with family members and beloved friends. Her and John both 
shared a passion for music; she was a fantastic dancer, specializing in 
the jitterbug, fox trot and the waltz. Jaci was a tremendously involved 
member of her community, volunteering and running numerous 
organizations throughout the years. Some of those include Chairperson 
of the Candy Striper Committee at the Memorial Hospital of Salem 
County, Charter member and Secretary of Boots and Saddles Riding Club, 
and Leader of two winning State Horse Bowl Championships. She received 
multiple awards for her dedication including the Woman of Achievement 
Award and the prestigious Crystal Rose Award from the Salem Chamber of 
Commerce. As a long-time member of Trinity United Methodist Church in 
Pennsville, South Jersey, she continually nurtured, studied and grew 
her faith. I will miss seeing Jaci at the Salem County Fair, but I take 
comfort knowing she is with our Lord in Heaven.
  God bless Jaci and God bless the United States of America.

              CELEBRATING BUENA BOROUGH'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to wish Buena 
Borough of South Jersey a happy 75th anniversary. This wonderful 
community has been a major part of the history of South Jersey, despite 
being one of the newer incorporated townships in the area. It was first 
settled as a part of Cape May County in 1692, making it one of the 
oldest settlements in the entire United States. Through the years, this 
community had a significant role in growing the economies of Cape May, 
Gloucester and Atlantic Counties before becoming its own incorporated 
town in 1949. A mass meeting was organized in the Landisville Fire Hall 
to discuss the formation of this new small city, drawing a record 
attendance. The new township resolved many issues related to the public 
water system and other industries, paving the way for many firms to 
come to the area in the years after. Buena Borough has flourished for 
the last 75 years, and I am proud to say they are an outstanding part 
of South Jersey.
  God Bless Buena Borough and God bless the United States of America.

                     HONORING SUPERVISOR MAT CONANT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LaMALFA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the agriculture impacts and 
public service career of Sutter County Supervisor Mat Conant.
  Mat is deeply rooted in California as a fifth generation California 
farmer, including three generations of farming in Sutter County dating 
back to the 1920's. Mat is a lifelong resident of Rio Oso where his 
family farms.
  Mat's early education was in Sutter and Yuba County where he proudly 
attended East Nicolaus High School and Yuba College. Mat would further 
his education at California Polytechnic State University (CalPoly) in 
San Luis Obispo earning a Bachelor's Degree. Mat also joined the 
California Agriculture Leadership Program furthering his interest and 
advocacy for the agriculture industry.
  Mat is a 21-year veteran of the East Nicolaus Fire Department, where 
he served in many different capacities during his tenure working to 
keep Sutter County firesafe. He is a Eucharistic Minister of the 
Catholic Church and an over 30-year member of the Knights of Columbus.
  Mat has served as a board member for the California Farm Bureau, 
Yuba-Sutter Farm Bureau, South Sutter Water District, East Nicolaus 
High School, Brown's Elementary School Board, South Sutter Little 
League, and as a Committee Member on the Diamond Walnut Advisory 
Committee.
  Mat with his wife, Lorene, have two sons one of which works with Mat 
and continues the strong Conant family legacy of farming in Northern 
California.
  We thank Supervisor Mat Conant for his many years of service and 
advocacy for the agriculture industry while on the Sutter County Board 
of Supervisors. We wish him all the best in his retirement.

                     RECOGNIZING ITA INTERNATIONAL

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 
contributions of ITA International LLC of Newport News, Virginia to the 
nation through their transition of Small Business Innovative Research 
(SBIR) developed technology to government and commercial use.
  Their approach is unique in that, first, they use commercial off the 
shelf products for the front- and back-end of the tool with the SBIR-
developed analytic algorithms ``in the middle''. This approach 
significantly reduces the cost required to deliver solutions by 
leveraging existing government software licenses integrated with SBIR-
developed algorithms. Secondly, rather than providing a piece of 
software, they marry their data analytic algorithms with subject matter 
experts with profound understanding to provide unsurpassed service, 
that ITA refers to as ``technology enabled professional services,'' to 
their customers. Finally, they have a structured process for applying 
these algorithms, a proprietary approach based on agile development 
that ensures continuous interaction with the customer and iterative 
improvement of the tools and services they provide.
  ITA provides a shining example of the exact intent of the SBIR 
program. ITA leveraged federally funded research in Phase I and Phase 
II to develop data analytic algorithms and then applied those 
algorithms to solve government and industry problems in Phase III 
through innovative services. While their focus has been on the 
Department of Defense, customers across the federal government and in 
industry are seeing the benefit of the technology enabled professional 
services they provide,
  One example is how ITA has perfected and extended a SBIR tool 
(LOGCOP) using SBIR Phase III contracts over the years to provide 
advanced data analytic and artificial intelligence techniques or 
decision support tools. ITA continues to develop one of the resulting 
tools, called the Availability Management System (AMS), for the Navy's 
Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center to better plan and execute 
surface ship maintenance periods. This tool has allowed the Navy to 
avoid hundreds of additional ship maintenance delay-days, improving 
readiness and diverting hundreds of millions of dollars to other 
critical purposes for a government investment a small fraction of that. 
AMS is being evaluated for broader use and integration into existing 
Navy decision support tools.
  On behalf of the 1st district of Virginia, I thank ITA for its 
service to our Nation, and I look forward to hearing about their future 
accomplishments.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Fourth 
Congressional District of Wisconsin, I would like to recognize the 
Arnwine Family for honoring their family's legacy of perseverance, 
activism, and dedication to create a more equal and just nation.
  Sterling Arnwine's 1936 interview with the Federal Writers Project 
captured the unimaginable hardship and persecution of him and his 
family while enslaved. I am inspired by the story of Sterling Arnwine 
and the commitment of his descendants to share the stories of Black 
Americans who suffered under the violent institution of American 
slavery.
  The sharing of stories not only memorializes the many people who 
suffered but also gives voice to the survivors. I thank them for all 
they have done to benefit our communities. The Arnwine Family has 
touched the lives of many, and I look forward to seeing the continued 
impact and change their family creates in the years to come.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to present the Quilt of 
Valor to Army veteran Sergeant Francis McArdle, in recognition of his 
great service to our country. Sgt. McArdle gave three years of his life 
to the United States by serving in the U.S. Army during one of the 
toughest times of American history, the Vietnam War. He served his 
country in a multitude of ways, first beginning with a special 
designation as a Forward Observer to the 101st Airborne Division with 
the 527th Artillery Unit. He then served as Communications Sergeant for 
Battery Company of the 527th Artillery before finishing his enlistment 
with the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. Not everyone answers the 
call to defend our freedom, particularly during such a turbulent time 
for our country. Sgt. McArdle was one of those rare patriots that did, 
and it was my great honor that I was able to present him with the Quilt 
of Valor. May God bless Sgt. McArdle and God bless the United States of 
America.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of a grateful 
Nation and the Citizens of the Twenty-Fourth District of Texas. The 
2024 Congressional Veteran Commendation is hereby presented to Zachary 
Ceballos, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, of Euless, Texas 
for his honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States of 
America and for his continued service to his community,
  Mr. Ceballos enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 2008, 
serving as a rifleman with 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, deploying to 
Sangin, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2011.

GallantFew, a local veteran service organization. He devotes his spare 
time to coaching veterans on mental health, teaching them rock 
climbing, helping lead the Metroport Veterans Association, and planning 
Melborial Day as well as Veterans Day observances in the community.
  Mr. Ceballos service is consistent with the finest traditions of the 
United States Marine Corps and reflects great credit upon himself, the 
State of Texas, and the United States of America.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, along with my colleagues Senators Mike 
Crapo and Jim Risch, I rise to recognize the leadership of Ty Blackford 
within his roles as President and Program Manager at the Idaho 
Environmental Coalition (IEC).
  During his time as President and Program Manager at IEC, Ty Blackford 
led his team to advance the cleanup mission at the U.S. Department of 
Energy's (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory Site (INL). Under his 
leadership, in 2022, IEC completed the exhumation of legacy waste at 
the Site's Subsurface Disposal Area 18 months ahead of schedule. 
Following the demolition of two ancillary structures at the Naval 
Reactors Facility, his team began demolition of the Submarine 1st 
Generation Westinghouse reactor prototype and recycled more than 420 
tons of non-radiological metals. In 2023, Ty's team completed the 
transfer of spent nuclear fuel from wet to dry storage nine months 
ahead of schedule.
  In 2024, Ty led the IEC team to complete the Accelerated Retrieval 
Project, one of the largest demolition projects completed in the 
history of DOE's environmental cleanup program. The project was 
completed three months ahead of schedule and under budget. In all, 
workers demolished more than 520,000 square feet of building space, 
which is equivalent to three times the footprint of the U.S. Capitol 
building in Washington, D.C.
  Under Ty's leadership, operations began at the Integrated Waste 
Treatment Unit in 2023 as well. To date, the project has processed over 
100,000 gallons of sodium-bearing waste. These most recent 
accomplishments have paved the way for DOE to meet two significant 
milestones outlined in the Idaho Settlement Agreement for the State of 
Idaho.
  Each of these accomplishments speak to Ty's 30-plus years of 
experience leading and managing large and complex projects for DOE's 
cleanup and nuclear operations programs at sites across the Nation, 
including the Idaho Cleanup Project, Savannah River, Hanford and Oak 
Ridge. He has set the bar high for future leaders and has established a 
baseline for success, of which Idaho can be proud.
  We thank Ty Blackford for his diligence in his role as President and 
Program Manager at IEC and for his accomplishments in the cleanup 
mission at INL.

    CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARSHALL STREET ARMORY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the 100th anniversary of the 
Marshall Street Armory, a historic landmark that has served as a vital 
cornerstone of the Lansing community.
  Since its opening in 1924, the Marshall Street Armory has played an 
important role in supporting our military through numerous conflicts 
and serving the people of Mid-Michigan.
  Originally home to the 119th Field Artillery Regiment of the Michigan 
National Guard, the armory was designed by Michigan's first state 
architect, Lynn W. Fry, and stands as one of the earliest examples of 
Gothic-inspired military architecture in the state. For more than 80 
years, it housed Lansing-based National Guard units that contributed to 
the defense of our Nation in nearly every war during that period. The 
Marshall Street Armory was also the staging ground for Guard units 
providing aid during domestic crises and natural disasters, helping to 
protect our country and assist those in need.
  Beyond its military purpose, the armory became a gathering place for 
local residents. It hosted weddings, concerts, swap meets, boxing 
matches, and even circuses, cementing its place as a hub for social 
events and activities. Whether for celebrations or service, the 
Marshall Street Armory always brought people together in times of 
peace.
  After the 119th Field Artillery Regiment was decommissioned in 2007, 
the armory closed its doors as a military facility. In 2010, it was 
placed on the National Register of Historic Places, securing its legacy 
as an architectural and historical treasure.
  In 2012, following extensive renovations, the Marshall Street Armory 
reopened as a nonprofit collaboration center. Today, it houses several 
organizations, including Capital Area United Way, Big Brothers Big 
Sisters, and the Capital Region Community Foundation. It continues to 
serve the Greater Lansing area in a new capacity, providing essential 
services and strengthening the fabric of Mid-Michigan.
  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Marshall Street Armory, 
let us honor both

[[Page E1131]]

its military heritage and its present role as a center of service and 
opportunity, filled with organizations dedicated to improving the lives 
of Lansing residents. It is with great appreciation and respect that I 
recognize the Marshall Street Armory's century of service.

       HONORING SERGEANT ANDREW ``TIM'' KINIRY (WWII ARMY MEDIC)

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to pay tribute to Sergeant 
Andrew ``Tim'' Kiniry, a 102-year-old U.S. Army veteran who served his 
country gallantly on the shores of Normandy during World War II. 
Sergeant Kiniry performed one of the most courageous duties a solider 
can do by volunteering as a medic right on the front lines of one of 
America's bloodiest battles. Not only did he charge bravely into battle 
with his unit, but he also simultaneously treated his fellow soldiers 
for injuries while under fire. Army medics were often the primary 
target on the battlefield, marked by the Red Cross for protection, but 
it ultimately led to increased fire by the Nazis. Tim, however, carried 
out his duties with bravery, applying tourniquets, bandaging wounds, 
and helping evacuate casualties to hospitals. This past year, he 
returned to Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day and 
pay homage to all the fallen heroes. In the years following the war, 
Tim has devoted much of his time educating the youth of the atrocities 
that war brings, and he loves to remind me of the great quote ``Lest we 
forget.'' I thank Tim for all he has done for the United States. God 
bless Sergeant ``Tim'' and God bless the United States of America.

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Brian E. 
Fuchs, who retired this month after 41 years of faithful and dedicated 
service as a civilian employee of the U.S. Army.
  After graduating from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Dr. 
Fuchs chose to apply his knowledge and experience to the U.S. 
military's munitions research at Picatinny Arsenal located in NJ-11. 
The contributions he has made to our national defense, and to our 
allies' defense, are enormous, and we all owe him a debt of gratitude.
  Dr. Fuchs first entered the U.S. Army in 1983 where he worked in 
energetics materials testing, detonation physics, and energetic 
formulations. Since then, Dr. Fuchs has maintained a variety of 
different positions on various boards and organizations focused on 
insensitive munitions research. Dr. Fuchs is also a leader in the 
rapidly growing field of research on explosive ink where, under his 
leadership, his team was able to produce the first qualified explosive 
ink.
  Along with his long career in munitions development, Dr. Fuchs is an 
Adjunct Professor for the Stevens Institute of Technology and serves as 
the Steering committee chair for NATO's Munitions Safety Information 
Analysis Center (MSIAC).
  Widely recognized by several organizations, Dr. Fuchs was awarded the 
National Defense Industrial Association Firepower Award for Technology 
Development in 2016. Dr. Fuchs has also been awarded the Academic R&D 
Award by Printed Electronics USA, the Six Army Research Development 
Achievement Award for Technical Excellence, and the Army Research 
Development Award for Leadership. These awards were all given in 
recognition of Dr. Fuchs' outstanding devotion to duty and his 
contributions to research and development of munitions.
  I want to thank Dr. Fuchs for the critical engineering and research 
work that he and his team have done over his career to support our 
national defense, and I wish him the best for a well-earned and restful 
retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and service of 
El Dorado County Supervisor John Hidahl, who passed away on November 2, 
2024, at the age of 73.
  John Hidahl was born and raised in California's Central Valley and 
graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a bachelor's degree in 
mechanical engineering. Throughout his successful career, he worked at 
Aerojet for 31 years and Northrop Grumman for 10 years, where he filled 
various roles, such as a rocket test engineer, the director of 
engineering, and the chief systems manager. Coming from a farming 
family, Supervisor Hidahl was also the Chairman of Hidahl Ranch, where 
he helped manage the almond and walnut farm.
  Outside of his career success, Supervisor Hidahl tirelessly worked to 
improve the community around him. His motto of service before self is 
evident in the various areas where he volunteered and served his 
community. Among his many other roles in the El Dorado Hills community, 
he served for 33 years on the County Water District, 36 years on the 
Area Planning Advisory Committee, and 23 years on the Community 
Council.
  Supervisor Hidahl was elected twice to the El Dorado County Board of 
Supervisors, where he served as the District 1 Supervisor while 
advocating for a balanced budget, open space preservation, and housing 
options for seniors. Supervisor Hidahl was also engaged with his 
community outside of his formal roles, as he also actively supported 
the boy and girl scouts along with groups that serve the county's 
homeless population. In his spare time, Supervisor Hidahl enjoyed 
spending time with his family, traveling, and being outdoors.
  Supervisor Hidahl is survived by his wife Eileen, their five 
daughters, and their 10 grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Supervisor Hidahl was a devoted public servant who loved 
his country, his county, and his community. He will be deeply missed by 
all those who knew him. It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor his memory.

RECOGNIZING THE FOUR LOWER SNAKE RIVER DAMS AND THE VALUE THEY PROVIDE 
                         TO EASTERN WASHINGTON

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the four Lower Snake River dams and the value they provide to Eastern 
Washington.
  The Columbia River System is the beating heart of the Pacific 
Northwest. This critical infrastructure helped transform our region 
from a dry, barren sage brush into one of the most productive 
agricultural regions in the world.
  It serves as a super-marine highway for farmers to ship their 
products all across America, while keeping thousands of trucks off the 
road every year. The dams along the Lower Snake River have strengthened 
our energy grid, lowered energy costs, and made us a leader in reducing 
carbon emissions.
  They help prevent life-threatening blackouts during extreme weather, 
not just in Washington state, but in California, Idaho, Oregon, 
Montana, and Wyoming. They also support a thriving tourism economy of 
small businesses and protect parts of our region from devastating 
floods.
  To put it simply: the Columbia River System is critical to our entire 
way of life.
  Thanks to historic investments by Congress through the years, the 
four Lower Snake River dams are nearly transparent to salmon. With some 
of the most effective fish passage systems in the nation, these dams 
have achieved an average survival rate for ocean-bound juvenile salmon 
of between 95 and 97 percent. For adults, that average is more than 98 
percent.
  The scientific evidence supports the reality that dams and salmon 
can--and do--co-exist. According to a 2018 evaluation conducted by the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 99.6 percent of juveniles and 97.3 
percent of all yearling Chinook salmon safely bypassed the Lower 
Granite Darn--a survival rate that exceeds the NOAA Biological 
performance standard of 96 percent.
  The same study found that steelhead salmon enjoyed a 100 percent 
juvenile survival rate and an overall dam passage rate of 99.4 percent. 
On top of that, available data suggests that 2023 was the highest count 
for adult sockeye salmon on record at Lower Granite Dam with 2,921 
adults returning.
  Despite the rhetoric surrounding the Lower Snake River dams and 
salmon, we continue to see improvements in the returns with 2024 
currently on track to be the third straight year of exceeding the 10-
year average sockeye return.
  This is not a coincidence. The Lower Snake River dams utilize some of 
the most informative technology we have to help fish migrate the river, 
including fish slides and fish ladders to help salmon get over the dams 
safely, fish friendly turbines, spillways, and bypass facilities.

[[Page E1132]]

  As a result, a recent study conducted by NOAA Fisheries concluded 
that survival rates along the Snake River system are approaching levels 
seen on rivers without dams. In fact, this study found that wild 
juvenile steelhead transported through the dams by barge return as an 
adult at an 80 percent higher rate than in-river migrating fish.
  In 1938, before the dams were built, it is estimated that 1.67 
million salmon and steelhead returned to the mouth of the Columbia 
River. In 2022, that estimate grew to 2.38 million. We do not have to 
choose between saving our dams and preserving our salmon populations. 
We can continue to protect endangered salmon without sacrificing our 
way of life.
  The Lower Snake River dams are critical for strengthening our energy 
grid and providing our region with some of the lowest energy costs in 
the nation. They help give us our competitive edge. In the Pacific 
Northwest, roughly 60 percent of the power consumed comes from 
hydroelectricity; in Washington state alone, that figure is closer to 
70 percent.
  Lower Granite Dam alone has six hydroelectric generators that 
generate up to 135 megawatts (MW) of energy each. Together, they have 
the capacity to generate 810 megawatts, which is enough electricity to 
power a city the size of Portland, Oregon.
  Ice Harbor Dam, another part of the Colulnbia-Snake River System, can 
generate enough electricity to power all of the homes in Spokane, 
Spokane Valley, and Wenatchee. Perhaps one of the most underappreciated 
aspects of the hydropower produced by these dams is that it can be 
dispatched at a moment's notice, helping families and businesses keep 
their lights on year-round.
  The Columbia-Snake River System also serves as a super-marine highway 
for farmers to ship their products all across America and around the 
world, all while reducing carbon emissions and lowering shipping costs.
  Each year, nearly 10 percent of all U.S. wheat exports are barged on 
the Snake River. Additionally, roughly 250,000 tons of wood chips are 
barged between locations on the Lower Columbia River and Lewiston, 
Idaho, where they are turned into pulp for paper production at mills 
across our region.
  In 2020, approximately 4.2 million tons of cargo were transported 
through the Snake River dams. It would have taken more than 42,000 rail 
cars or 162,000 semi-trucks to transport that amount of cargo on land. 
If these dams were breached, it would lead to an increase in diesel 
fuel consumption by nearly 5 million gallons per year. It would also 
result in an increase in CO2 and other harmful emissions by more than 
1.2 million tons per year.
  The increased trucking activity would- also increase the cost of 
fuel, highway and terminal facility maintenance, driver time, and 
vehicle maintenance by more than $69 million per year, all of which 
would be passed on to consumers.
  The bottom line is that tearing out the Lower Snake River dams would 
not only diminish grid reliability and make it harder for local farmers 
to feed the world, it would be counterproductive to achieving our 
carbon reduction goals.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
enormous benefits the four Lower Snake River Dams provide for the 
people of Eastern Washington and for the entire Pacific Northwest.

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote for H.R. 82, 
Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, due to air travel cancellations. 
As both a co-sponsor and a signer of the discharge petition that 
brought this bill to the floor, I am a strong supporter of eliminating 
the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension 
offset (GPO) that denies some retirees from receiving their full Social 
Security benefits.
  Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 456.

   RECOGNIZING THE GLOBAL MEDICAL RESPONSE 2024 STARS OF LIFE AWARD 
                               RECIPIENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 12, 2024

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Global 
Medical Response Stars of Life award recipients for 2024.
  Each year, the American Ambulance Association (AAA) honors a select 
group of Emergency Medical Services professionals for their commitment 
to patient care, integrity, and compassion through the Stars of Life 
program. Global Medical Response, a member of the AAA and the world's 
largest provider of emergent and non-emergent medical transportation 
and healthcare services, has identified 33 of its frontline heroes for 
this distinction, representing the best of the best in the air and on 
the ground.
  We will find these heroes all around us in our communities. From 
Maui, Hawaii where a Paramedic, served as the Incident Commander for 
EMS ground units during the deadly 2023 fire that devastated Lahaina to 
an advanced EMF in Lagrange, GA, who safely delivered a baby while the 
baby's mother was being transported to a hospital, and performed 
lifesaving interventions on the newborn, who was ``pulseless'' at the 
time of birth to Waco, TX where a paramedic, saved the life of a 
cardiac arrest patient after working on the individual for 30 minutes 
before achieving return of spontaneous circulation.
  There are countless stories to share and so much that we can learn 
from the day-to-day lives of these heroes. We must learn to exhibit 
integrity in everything we do and everything we say. We must act with 
compassion and grace in even the most daunting and challenging of 
situations. We must be vigilant, never wavering in our commitment to 
doing what is right for the community and answering the call to serve.
  So that we will never forget the immense contributions to our 
communities made by the 2024 Global Medical Response Stars of Life 
award recipients, I respectfully request that each of their names be 
included in the Record to honor their service and humbly thank them for 
showing us what it means to truly serve, while providing care to the 
world at a moment's notice.

      PENN STATE WRESTLERS ENGAGING IN THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

  The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. Joyce) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, throughout American history, 
leaders of various faiths have impactfully tended the needs of 
believers while simultaneously participating in political movements 
relating to significant issues, such as equality, the right to vote, 
and the sanctity of human life.
  The roles of leader and political organizer never have been mutually 
exclusive.
  I was reminded of this duality in roles, by choice of the individual, 
during a recent conversation with a constituent. In short, the 
constituent informed me that the onstage appearance of current and 
former Penn State wrestlers at President Trump's rally at Penn State 
was drawing unneeded criticism. Just as religious leaders can be both 
devoted advocates of their ministry and passionate champions of their 
causes, the Penn State wrestlers are most certainly entitled by our 
Constitution to be both representatives of their athletic program and 
citizens who are actively engaged in the electoral process.
  The Nittany Lion wrestling program is renowned, not only for 
producing national championship teams, but for developing wrestlers who 
have dominated their sport on the collegiate level and then represented 
our country in international competitions as recently as the Olympic 
Games in Paris this past summer.
  Our Nation prides itself on the inclusive nature of our political 
process. It is wrong to advocate for engaged citizenry on one hand 
while selectively choosing citizens who can participate and who cannot 
on the other hand.
  According to recent reports, voter turnouts among people ages 18-29 
was a mere 42 percent overall in the most recent Presidential election. 
That figure, that 42 percent, is at least 10 percent lower than the 
turnout of the same group 4 years prior in the 2020 Presidential 
election.
  Mindful of that decline, the Penn State wrestlers, particularly those 
who are still pursuing their degrees, should be applauded for embracing 
one of our most cherished freedoms: the right to vote.
  Competing as a wrestler does not preclude an individual from 
expressing political viewpoints, despite criticism that might or might 
not be of a partisan nature.
  As a proud Penn State alumnus, I witnessed firsthand the wrestlers 
exercising their First Amendment right to free speech and encouraging 
all Americans to cast their ballot. Our great Nation needs the wisdom, 
enthusiasm, and talents of people across generations to overcome the 
challenges that were the focus of our most recent election. It is fair 
to say that the generation with the most at stake is the youngest 
generation. It is their leadership that should be encouraged. It is 
their perspective that must be considered. It is their voice that must 
be heard.
  For the benefit and for the enrichment of all Americans, I 
congratulate these young wrestlers for exercising their constitutional 
rights, and I personally thank them for their commitment to engaging in 
our political process.


                    The American People Have Spoken

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the past 4 years, the 
Biden-Harris administration has failed the American people.
  Under President Biden's watch, our adversaries have been emboldened, 
inflation has skyrocketed, and our borders have been left unsecure.
  With these crises, we have seen Americans be put in danger. We 
recognize that the Biden-Harris administration had no answers. They had 
no solutions on how to keep us safe, and now the American people have 
spoken.
  When voters were asked if they were better off now compared to 4 
years ago, they resoundingly said no. That is why in January, President 
Donald J. Trump will return to the Oval Office.
  Under President Trump's leadership, we will, once again, lower energy 
prices by utilizing the energy sources that are under the feet of my 
constituents in Pennsylvania.
  Under President Trump's leadership, we will secure our southern 
border and put a stop to the flow of deadly drugs like fentanyl that 
have taken far too many American lives.
  Under President Donald J. Trump, our Nation will, once again, return 
to a policy of peace through strength that has helped to keep our 
Nation safe and the American people free.

                           THE TRUMP MANDATE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the people spoke and 
Donald Trump and J.D. Vance achieved the most historic political 
comeback in American history, while also naming extraordinary patriots 
to his cabinet: Elise Stefanik as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Tom 
Homan as the border czar, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, Kristi 
Noem as Homeland Security Secretary, Mike Waltz as National Security 
Advisor, Lee Zeldin as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, 
Governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. Ambassador to Jerusalem, and the 
extraordinary Susie Wiles as Chief of Staff, working with the deputy 
chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller.
  The Trump mandate is a recognition of his policy achievements, which 
I submitted to the Congressional Record, January 21, 2021, pages E60-
E62, and achievements to the First Lady, Melania Trump, on January 21, 
2021, pages E52-E53.
  As chairman of the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia 
Subcommittee and chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I especially 
appreciate Donald Trump, who will achieve peace through strength.
  Without equivocation, he stood with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, clearly stating Iran must not secure a nuclear weapon, 
threatening our Arab allies from Kuwait to UAE to Bahrain, Qatar, and 
Saudi Arabia, along with NATO member Turkiye.
  Trump stood with Ukraine against war criminal Putin, supplying 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy Javelin missiles, placing troops in Poland, and 
stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which financed Putin's murderous 
atrocities.
  Trump stood with Taiwan, supplying defensive weapons to deter the 
Chinese Communist Party from an invasion threatening the Korean and 
Japanese shipping lanes, along with the shipping capabilities of our 
great ally, India.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all Americans at risk of more 
9/11 attacks imminent as warned by the FBI. Trump will reinstitute 
existing laws to protect American families with peace through strength.

  HONORING THE DILIGENT SERVICE OF KEVIN GRANEY, PRESIDENT OF GENERAL 
                         DYNAMICS ELECTRIC BOAT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fong). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the diligent and 
honorable service of the president of General Dynamics Electric Boat, 
Mr. Kevin Graney of Stonington, Connecticut.
  On December 1, in a couple weeks, Kevin is slated to retire from his 
eventful and impactful 5-year term as the shipyard lead for the United 
States Navy's submarine force, and it is more than fitting that this 
Chamber take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service to our 
Nation.
  A native of Cheektowaga, New York, Kevin's career spans nearly 40 
years of service to the Navy's shipbuilding enterprise. His 
intelligence, patriotism, and leadership qualities stood out at an 
early age, foreshadowing a promising career as a naval officer.
  Upon graduating high school, he attended State University of New York 
Maritime College, earning a bachelor's degree in marine engineering and 
nuclear science, which would serve him well as a submariner and 
instructor at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit in Ballston Spa, 
New York.
  Following a distinguished career at sea, Kevin began his shipbuilding 
career at General Dynamics Electric Boat in 1995 as a senior engineer 
working on critical power components for the Virginia-class submarine 
program.
  Following his assignment at Electric Boat, he moved to Newport News 
Shipbuilding in Virginia to design the reactor plant for the next-
generation aircraft carrier, the CVN-78 program. He then moved overseas 
and managed Electric Boat engineers to assist our allies in the U.K. as 
they built their British Astute-class nuclear submarine program. 
Eventually, he returned to Electric Boat and began his last term over 
the last 5 years in 2019 as CEO of the shipyard.
  During his time, the 120-year-old EB shipyard experienced a massive 
generational transformation with new and improved infrastructure, 
increased hiring, and new operations to dramatically improve 
performance and efficiency in the submarine industrial base.
  In 2023, Electric Boat hired nearly 5,400 new workers, the biggest 
number in its history, even surpassing its growth in World War II and 
the Cold War. The total workforce today now exceeds 23,000, and they 
are still hiring today.
  If that was not challenging enough, 5 months into Kevin's ascension 
to president, the shipyard was confronted with the global COVID 
pandemic. It is hard to visualize how difficult it is to manage an 
airborne pathogen in a shipyard, particularly a submarine shipyard 
where, again, the quarters are so tight.
  Nonetheless, they kept the shipyard open. They did not close for a 
single day during the pandemic, and that is because Kevin Graney 
overcame this crisis and skillfully managed operations to continue as a 
critical industry in our Nation's security.
  After performance across the shipyard and the nationwide industrial 
base was stabilized, it was then faced with increased rates of 
retirement of senior workers and a corresponding reduction in the 
supervisory trade workforce.
  Since then, Kevin has spearheaded recovery efforts that have 
transformed the shipyard in just a short time. A few months ago, he 
signed a 5-year Metal Trades collective bargaining agreement with the 
Metal Trades Council, which represents machinists, electricians, 
carpenters, teamsters, and boilermakers that increased their pay by 25 
percent, retaining their pension and health benefits at the same time.
  Next to me is the USS Iowa, the 24th Virginia-class submarine, which 
was delivered to the Navy a couple of weeks ago. As I stand here today, 
it is undergoing sea trials and will be commissioned to the U.S. Navy 
in a few months or so.
  Mr. Speaker, as ranking member and chair of the House Armed Services' 
Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee and the Congressman 
representing EB's facility in Groton, Connecticut, I have had a front-
row seat to Kevin's tenure. It was not an easy time.
  Through it all, though, he maintained a steady level of confidence 
from his peers and overcame adversities that were not anticipated at 
the start of his tenure.
  I haven't even talked about the AUKUS security agreement, which last 
December this Congress voted to sell three Virginia-class nuclear-
powered submarines to our great ally, Australia, the first time in 
history our country has ever made that commitment.
  He has built the foundation, and it will be incredibly difficult to 
replace him, but we welcome the next president of Electric Boat, Mark 
Rayha, who I am sure will continue in Kevin's steps.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kevin as he enters this new era of 
retirement with his wife, Cheryl, and his daughter, Katherine. I ask 
that my colleagues in the House, and particularly those who serve on 
the House Armed Services Committee along with me, join me in 
recognizing his life of service to the Navy and the United States by 
submitting his legacy into the permanence of the Congressional Record.

             PUBLIC SERVANTS DESERVE THEIR EARNED BENEFITS

  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 82, the 
Social Security Fairness Act.
  People in western New York and across the country rely on Social 
Security to meet their basic needs and live well. This bipartisan 
legislation fixes loopholes that unjustifiably cut benefits for 
millions of Social Security recipients.
  The Social Security Fairness Act repeals the Windfall Elimination 
Provision and the Government Pension Offset, existing provisions of the 
Social Security Act that slash Social Security for millions of public 
workers.
  Dedicated public servants--teachers, firefighters, postal workers, 
police officers, and their spouses or widows--are unfairly seeing 
Social Security cuts because of these loopholes. This is a slap in the 
face to the people who have given so much to our communities.
  All Americans deserve the benefits they worked so hard to earn, and 
this bill delivers on this promise but especially those who have 
dedicated their lives to public service.
  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation swiftly and deliver for 
our fellow Americans.

                    CONGRATULATING DR. VICTOR AMBROS

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor my 
constituent, Dr. Victor Ambros of the University of Massachusetts Chan 
Medical School, on being awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on 
microRNA.
  He shares this tremendous distinction with Gary Ruvkun of Harvard 
Medical School. I am proud to be from Massachusetts today.
  Mr. Speaker, decades ago, scientists discovered that our genes, the 
tiny strands of DNA that make us who we are, are translated into 
another compound called RNA, which helps make sure our cells function.
  Thanks to the laureates' work, we now know that tiny pieces of RNA 
called microRNA can actually do things all by themselves, speeding up 
or slowing down important cellular functions.
  Their work has opened up unprecedented new research opportunities 
when it comes to all kinds of things, including cancer treatment. 
Thanks to this work, we have learned more about how we become who we 
are.
  I speak for Worcester, for Massachusetts, for the United States, and 
the world when I say thank you to Dr. Ambros for his contributions to 
our understanding of how we become who we are.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  Holy and eternal God, we come before You, humbled by the mercy You 
have shown us in these last days and months. From Your throne, You have 
borne witness to our less than loving behavior, our harsh rhetoric of 
the election season, and our insatiable desire to ensure that the 
balance of power tips in our favor.
  Remind us again that the mellifluent words, the most convincing 
arguments are but a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal if they are not 
grounded in love.
  Even if our certitude and sureness, our knowledge and conviction are 
enough to move mountains, if we do not love both our neighbor and our 
adversary, all our success amounts to nothing.
  Teach us again how to be patient and kind, neither envious nor 
boastful, arrogant or rude. Wherever we stand, may we not insist things 
go our way, nor hold a grudge when they don't.
  In Your truth, show us how to bear all things, believe all things, 
hope all things, and endure all things; and, above all, to strive to be 
bearers of the greatest of all things: love.
  In Your merciful name we pray.
  Amen.

             EQUAL TREATMENT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS ACT OF 2023

  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5342) to amend title II of the Social Security Act to 
replace the windfall elimination provision with a formula equalizing 
benefits for certain individuals with noncovered employment, and for 
other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 5342

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Treatment of Public 
     Servants Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. REPLACEMENT OF THE WINDFALL ELIMINATION PROVISION 
                   WITH A FORMULA EQUALIZING BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN 
                   INDIVIDUALS WITH NONCOVERED EMPLOYMENT.

       (a) In General.--Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act 
     (42 U.S.C. 415(a)) is amended by inserting after paragraph 
     (7) the following:
       ``(8)(A) In the case of an individual whose primary 
     insurance amount would be computed under paragraph (1) of 
     this subsection--
       ``(i) who first becomes eligible for an old-age or 
     disability insurance benefit after 2067,
       ``(ii) who subsequently becomes entitled to such benefit, 
     and
       ``(iii) who has earnings derived from noncovered service 
     performed in a year after 1977,
     the primary insurance amount of such individual shall be the 
     amount computed or recomputed under this paragraph.
       ``(B) The primary insurance amount of an individual 
     described in subparagraph (A), as computed or recomputed 
     under this paragraph, shall be the product derived by 
     multiplying--
       ``(i) the individual's primary insurance amount, as 
     determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection and 
     subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, by
       ``(ii) a fraction--
       ``(I) the numerator of which is the individual's average 
     indexed monthly earnings (determined without regard to 
     subparagraph (C)), and
       ``(II) the denominator of which is an amount equal to the 
     individual's average indexed monthly earnings (as determined 
     under subparagraph (C)),
     rounded, if not a multiple of $0.10, to the next lower 
     multiple of $0.10.
       ``(C)(i) For purposes of determining an individual's 
     primary insurance amount pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii)(II) 
     of subparagraph (B), the individual's average indexed monthly 
     earnings shall be determined by treating all recorded 
     noncovered earnings (as defined in clause (ii)(I)) derived by 
     the individual from noncovered service performed in each year 
     after 1977 as `wages' (as defined in section 209 for purposes 
     of this title), which shall be treated as included in the 
     individual's adjusted total covered earnings (as defined in 
     clause (ii)(II)) for such calendar year together with amounts 
     consisting of `wages' (as so defined without regard to this 
     subparagraph) paid during such calendar year and self-
     employment income (as defined in section 211(b)) for taxable 
     years ending with or during such calendar year.
       ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph:
       ``(I) The term `recorded noncovered earnings' means 
     earnings derived from noncovered service (other than 
     noncovered service as a member of a uniformed service (as 
     defined in section 210(m)) for which satisfactory evidence is 
     determined by the Commissioner to be available in the records 
     of the Commissioner.
       ``(II) The term `adjusted total covered earnings' means, in 
     connection with an individual for any calendar year, the sum 
     of the wages paid to the individual during such calendar year 
     (as adjusted under subsection (b)(3)) plus the self-
     employment income derived by the individual during any 
     taxable year ending with or during such calendar year (as 
     adjusted under subsection (b)(3)).
       ``(iii) The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide 
     by regulation or other public guidance for methods for 
     determining whether satisfactory evidence is available in the 
     records of the Commissioner for earnings for noncovered 
     service (other than noncovered service as a member of a 
     uniformed service (as defined in section 210(m))) to be 
     treated as recorded noncovered earnings. Such methods shall 
     provide for reliance on earnings information which is 
     provided to the Commissioner by employers and which, as 
     determined by the Commissioner, constitute a reasonable basis 
     for treatment of earnings for noncovered service as recorded 
     noncovered earnings. In making determinations under this 
     clause, the Commissioner shall also take into account any 
     documentary or other evidence of earnings derived from 
     noncovered service by an individual which is provided by the 
     individual to the Commissioner and which the Commissioner 
     considers appropriate as a reasonable basis for treatment of 
     such earnings as recorded noncovered earnings.
       ``(D) Upon the death of an individual whose primary 
     insurance amount is computed or recomputed under this 
     paragraph, such primary insurance amount shall be computed or 
     recomputed under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
       ``(E) In the case of any individual whose primary insurance 
     amount would be computed under this paragraph who first 
     becomes entitled after 1985 to a monthly periodic payment 
     made by a foreign employer or foreign country that is based 
     in whole or in part upon noncovered service, the primary 
     insurance amount of such individual shall be computed or 
     recomputed under paragraph (7) or paragraph (1), as 
     applicable, for months beginning with the first month of the 
     individual's initial entitlement to such monthly periodic 
     payment.''.
       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 215(a)(7)(A) of such 
     Act (42 U.S.C. 415(a)(7)(A)) is amended--

     shall apply with respect to monthly insurance benefits

     amount would be computed under paragraph (1) of this 
     subsection--
       ``(A) who first becomes eligible for an old-age or 
     disability insurance benefit after 2024 and before 2068,

     and
       ``(C) who has earnings derived from noncovered service 
     performed in a year after 1977,

     higher of the amount computed or recomputed under paragraph 
     (7) without regard to this paragraph or the amount that would 
     be computed or recomputed under paragraph (8) if the 
     individual were an individual described in subparagraph (A) 
     of such paragraph.''.
       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 215(a)(7)(A) of such Act

     recomputed'' and inserting ``shall, subject to paragraph (9),

       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section 
     shall apply with respect to monthly insurance benefits 
     payable on or after January 1, 2025.

                   BENEFIT AMOUNT IS REDUCED BY THE WINDFALL 
                   ELIMINATION PROVISION.

       (a) In General.--Section 215(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
     415(a)), as amended by sections 2 and 3, is further amended 
     by adding at the end the following:
       ``(10)(A) For any month beginning at least 270 days after 
     the date of enactment of the Equal Treatment of Public 
     Servants Act of 2023, the Commissioner of Social Security 
     shall, subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), make an 
     additional monthly payment of $100 to each individual who is 
     an eligible individual for such month, and an additional 
     monthly payment of $50 to each individual (other than an 
     eligible individual) who is entitled to a benefit under 
     section 202 for such month on the basis of the wages and 
     self-employment income of such eligible individual.
       ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `eligible 
     individual' for a month means an individual who--
       ``(i)(I) first becomes eligible for an old-age or

     shall not apply in the case of an individual whose monthly 
     benefit under section 202 or 223 is reduced, regardless of 
     the amount of the reduction, based on the individual's 
     receipt of other income or benefits for such month or the 
     application of section 203(a) or due to the adjustment or 
     recovery of an overpayment under section 204.

     increased by any percentage effective with any month as a 
     result of a determination made under subsection (i), each of 
     the dollar amounts in subparagraph (A) shall be increased by

     SEC. 6. STUDY ON PARTNERING WITH STATE AND LOCAL PENSION 
                   SYSTEMS.

       (a) Study.--
       (1) In general.--The Commissioner of Social Security shall 
     study and test the administrative feasibility of partnering 
     with State and local pension systems, or other governmental 
     entities, to improve the collection and sharing of 
     information relating to State and local noncovered pensions.
       (2) Coordination with state and local pension systems.--In 
     conducting the study described in paragraph (1), the 
     Commissioner shall coordinate with State and local pension 
     systems that reflect the diversity of systems and individual 
     experiences to explore the development of automated data 
     exchange agreements that facilitate reporting of information 
     relating to noncovered pensions.
       (b) Report.--The Commissioner of Social Security shall 
     conclude the study described in subsection (a) not later than 
     4 years after the date of enactment of this Act. As soon as 
     possible after conclusion of the study and not later than 
     4\1/2\ years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
     Commissioner shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means 
     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance 
     of the Senate a report on the results of the study. Such 
     report shall include the following:
       (1) A discussion of how the automated data exchange 
     agreements could be implemented to cover noncovered pensions 
     nationally, including the range of implementation timelines 
     across State and local pension systems, or with other 
     governmental entities.
       (2) An analysis of the barriers to developing automated 
     data exchange agreements and lessons learned that can help 
     address these barriers.
       (3) A description of alternative methods for obtaining 
     information related to noncovered pensions, and an analysis 
     of the barriers to obtaining noncovered pension data through 
     such methods.
       (4) An explanation of how coverage information is obtained 
     by the Social Security Administration when an individual 
     purchases service credits to apply to a new covered or 
     noncovered pension after moving from another covered or 
     noncovered pension within the State or in another State.
       (5) An estimate of the total amount, as of the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, of noncovered pensions not reported to 
     the Social Security Administration as a result of 
     noncompliance with voluntary reporting policies.
       (c) State and Local Pension Information To Be Requested by 
     the Commissioner.--Section 202 of the Social Security Act (42 
     U.S.C. 402) is amended by inserting after subsection (l) the 
     following:
       ``(m) State and Local Pension Information To Be Requested 
     by the Commissioner.--
       ``(1) The Commissioner may partner with States to request 
     information, including the information specified in paragraph 
     (2), with respect to any designated distribution (as defined 
     in section 3405(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) 
     from an employer deferred compensation plan (as defined in 
     section 3405(e)(5) of such Code) of the State (or political 
     subdivision thereof) to a participant of such plan in any 
     case in which any portion of such participant's earnings for 
     service under such plan did not constitute `employment' as 
     defined in section 210 for purposes of this title.
       ``(2) The information specified in this paragraph is the 
     following:
       ``(A) The name and Social Security account number of the 
     participant receiving the designated distribution.
       ``(B) The dollar amount of the designated distribution and 
     the date paid.
       ``(C) The date on which the participant initially became 
     eligible for a designated distribution under the plan and, if 
     different, the date of payment of the initial designated 
     distribution.
       ``(D) The dates of each period of service under the plan 
     that did not constitute `employment' as defined in section 
     210 for purposes of this title, and the dates of any other 
     period of service under the plan.''.
       (d) Definitions.--In this section--
       (1) the term ``noncovered pension'' means a pension any 
     part of which is based on noncovered service (within the 
     meaning of section 215(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (42 
     U.S.C. 415(a)(7))); and
       (2) the term ``covered pension'' means any other pension.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Arrington) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this bill under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a great injustice that has persisted now for 
four decades. Some of our hardest working fellow Americans who are 
public servants in certain States where they have non-Social Security 
covered employment--or to say it this way, where they have teacher 
retirement systems separate from Social Security, or firefighter 
retirement systems separate from Social Security--have what is called a 
windfall elimination provision in the Social Security law, which has 
shortchanged roughly 2 million hardworking public servants.
  Some people are still getting a windfall, but the vast majority are 
not getting what they earned and what they put into the Social Security 
system. So my colleague, Representative   John Larson, who I serve with 
on the Committee on Ways and Means, and who I consider a dear friend 
and someone who I know is very passionate about fixing Social 
Security's insolvency, which looms large over the next 10 years, this 
is but one element of what is not working in Social Security for our 
retirees and Social Security recipients.
  To solve this inequity and injustice, some of my colleagues have 
decided they would just repeal the windfall elimination provision 
altogether. That sounds good, but it is going to cost $192 billion to 
do that. We shouldn't be constrained by cost to do the right thing, but 
to repeal the windfall elimination provision would go back to pre-1983 
when we had a windfall to certain Americans in the same States where 
they had independent retirement systems, and we were spending more 
money for certain retirees than they put into the Social Security 
system.
  There was a great discrepancy and inequity between these individuals 
in these States and the vast majority of the tens of millions of other 
retirees across the country. So you had a teacher or a firefighter in 
certain States, like Texas, pre-1983 getting a windfall, large sums of 
money, over similarly situated people in other States. Firefighters and 
teachers are doing the same work, making roughly the same amount of 
money, but getting less benefits.
  What we should do is fix the inadequacy of the windfall elimination 
provision that was oversimplified and did not use the data that we have 
today and make sure that people are paid what they are owed in terms of 
their benefits, but not revert back to pre-windfall elimination 
provision, where we were spending tens of billions of dollars more than 
we needed to according to what people put in it.
  Why does that matter? Because we should have a system of fairness for 
every public servant in every State, every retiree who fits that 
definition. It is also because if we start just throwing money at this 
and allowing windfall payments to certain retirees, we are going to 
accelerate the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund.

[[Page H5922]]

  One outside expert says that we will accelerate that if we go to H.R. 
82 and just pull the plug on the windfall elimination provision, as 
opposed to fixing it and getting it right. We will accelerate it by 6 
months.
  We should be responsible in how we do this. We should consider 
retirees in every State, and we should also consider future retirees 
because what we do and how we solve problems doesn't just impact the 
people who have been shortchanged, and we need to deal with that, but 
we will impact future retirees, as well.
  I am simply asking my colleagues to do the right thing, address this 
inequity with WEP and our public servants, but do it the right way so 
that we don't compromise the integrity and the fiscal responsibility of 
managing the trust fund and put these public servants now once again at 
odds with the vast majority of public servants who are retired.
  Mr. Speaker, that is a mouthful, by the way. This is a complex issue, 
but what is not complicated is people who have been shortchanged need 
to get the money that they rightfully are owed by their government. I 
can start there and say that Democratic and Republican colleagues alike 
agree on that, but my bill will do it in a fiscally responsible way.
  I think this H.R. 82 is well-intended, but it is going to accelerate 
the bankruptcy of Social Security. That is not good for anybody, 
current or future retirees.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I start by acknowledging my good friend and colleague, 
and I thank him. I think his heart is in the right place.
  Let me say, having worked on this issue for a number of years, to 
have a Social Security, and in this case a portion of it, come to the 
floor, albeit under suspension and not through regular order, Mr. 
Speaker, is a step in the right direction, but the American people have 
to be outraged by the fact that it has been over 50 years since 
Congress has adjusted Social Security. By that, I mean enhanced Social 
Security for its recipients. Imagine that.
  Do you think a few things have happened since Richard Nixon was 
President of the United States? Do you think a few things have 
happened, especially as we live in this post-COVID and now inflationary 
period?
  It impacts over 70 million of our fellow Americans. This provision 
that my colleague and good friend is talking about, WEP, is minuscule 
in terms of comparing that to individuals. As well intended as I 
believe he is, this doesn't straighten out the problem. In our bill, 
the Social Security 2100 Act, we repeal WEP and GPO, and we pay for it. 
That is the responsible thing that Congress has to do on behalf of the 
American people.

  Here are the facts: 70 million Americans rely on Social Security, and 
it is the Nation's number one antipoverty program for the elderly and 
the number one antipoverty program for children. More veterans rely on 
Social Security for disability than they do the VA.
  Congress has done nothing to help these individuals out. Add to that, 
Mr. Speaker, the fact that 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible 
for Social Security.
  What we need to do today, and in both of these bills that are coming 
before us, are steps forward, but we need to come together as a 
Congress and vote to fix Social Security in a manner that doesn't hurt 
or cut benefits for individuals who haven't seen a benefit enhancement 
in more than 50 years. We come here today and say here is a crumb, but 
even in the form of this crumb, this proposal will cut benefits for 
hardworking, everyday Americans.
  I respect my colleague, and I do believe that his heart is in the 
right place, but Congress--both sides--have responsibility here, but 
perhaps now there is an opportunity for us to act--perhaps the fact 
that even under suspension, not regular order with public hearings 
where viewers get to see and actually hear from expert witnesses and 
get to hear both the fiscal side of what needs to be paid for but also 
the benefits side in terms of what has not been done.
  Imagine, my dear friend knows this, 5 million of our fellow 
Americans--and they are in Texas and Connecticut--get below poverty-
level checks from their government. So it is great that you have a 
proposal for WEP, but 5 million people currently on Social Security get 
below poverty-level checks from the wealthiest Nation in the world and 
from a country that has had a program in place, but Congress hasn't 
acted in over 50 years. Most of the 5 million are women, and most of 
them are women of color.
  There are more than 33 million who the only benefit that they have, 
the only thing that keeps them out of poverty, is Social Security, and 
Congress hasn't acted since 1971. These people will be hurt by this 
proposal.
  Benefit cuts in a time of inflation? Ask your constituents back home, 
Mr. Speaker, whether or not they can afford this cut.

                              {time}  1615

  Now, here is the other irony. Here we have one of the great economic 
development plans ever instituted by the United States Congress; That 
is right, an economic development plan, Social Security. How so?
  Every district, on average, has about 143,000 Social Security 
recipients. Every district, monthly, receives on average $200 million 
in cash coming into their district.
  In fact, for my dear friend and colleague here, $222 million comes 
into his district on a monthly basis. He has more than 95,000 retirees, 
9,000 children who get money from Social Security, 10,000 widows, 4,800 
spouses, and 14,000 disabled.
  Congress has done nothing. These cuts will take place because 
Congress hasn't stepped up and said we need to fund this program, not 
cut it. Some say back in 1983 they did do something. Yeah, what they 
did is they raised the age, another great proposal on the other side. 
For every year you raise the age, that is a 7 percent cut in benefits. 
Let's raise the age to age 70, the Republican Study Committee says, and 
what does that do? It cuts benefits by 21 percent.
  Aren't you glad you worked hard and invested and put your money aside 
so that you could find out that, yeah, what we are going to do is raise 
the age so you work longer, and as you are living longer, we expect 
that you will get less in retirement, not more. It makes no sense 
whatsoever.
  We need to come together as a Congress and vote to enhance the 
Nation's number one antipoverty program for the elderly and for our 
children.
  I respect the good intentions that people have, but as they say, the 
road to hell oftentimes is paved with good intentions. In this case, 
though, let's not talk about the parties. There is a lot of blame to go 
around here. How about we focus on the people, the American people, who 
we take an oath of office and swear to serve.
  Staring this Congress in the face is over 50 years of inaction and 70 
million people who are impacted by this in what is the Nation's number 
one antipoverty program for the elderly and for our children.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  My friend mentioned my seniors in west Texas. Let me tell you what 
they sent me here to do. They sent me here to be an advocate for them, 
to ensure that we have fair and just laws, to fix what is broken about 
Social Security but do it in a way that we don't accelerate what will 
be an automatic cut in less than 10 years.
  By repealing the windfall that existed before 1983, you are saying 
you are okay with taxpayers just spending more money than they should, 
more money than what has been earned and owed to the seniors, and in a 
way that creates a vast and tremendous discrepancy and inequity between 
2 million people in several States as opposed to almost 60 million 
across the country.
  How unfair and how nearsighted and narrow-minded can we be not to 
consider the fact that we will have a bankrupt system and that we have 
future seniors who can't bank on their retirement because we want to go 
back to prewindfall? It doesn't make sense, Mr. Speaker.
  The Democrats had control of this place from top to bottom from 2020 
to

[[Page H5923]]

2022, and they didn't fix it. Republicans had control when I was a 
freshman in 2017. Let me tell the world: They didn't fix it. The only 
way we are going to fix it is if we come together. I agree with Mr. 
Larson that there are broader provisions to look at and the system as a 
whole to address going forward.
  You mentioned benefits. That is a great place to do it, but to 
suggest that we are going to go back prewindfall elimination provision 
and have a $2,500 additional cut in 2033 because we are not doing it 
the right way and responsible way and equitable way because we now have 
the data, I just think is egregiously irresponsible for all parties 
involved, including our children, who don't have much of a say in this, 
even though they own the deferred tax on all of these programs that are 
bankrupt, including Medicare.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5342, the Equal 
Treatment of Public Servants Act, which my friend from Texas 
introduced, which was modeled or introduced similarly to a bill that 
our fellow Texan, Kevin Brady, introduced, because it is a responsible 
piece of legislation designed to address a problem head-on.
  Here is the problem. Everybody at home watching this needs to 
understand the joke. We are playing with house money yet again. We are 
playing with funny money. We are pretending and lying to the American 
people that the Social Security funds that are extracted from their 
checks are sitting in a lockbox, sitting in an account for them. It is 
not. That is a lie.
  The money is taken out of your check now, and that money is then 
given to those people who are retiring now, those who have retired. 
That is the truth. It is a tax.
  What happened here was we messed up because we are government. We 
mess up almost every single second. Government messed up, and now we 
are trying to fix the mess up.
  In this case, my friend from Texas has introduced a bill that 
responsibly fixes the mess up. It actually tries to go in and say if 
you are a firefighter, if you are a cop, if you are a teacher and you 
have got the situation where you have got another job and that Social 
Security was taken out of your check but you are not getting the 
benefit of that because you have a pension, this proportional model, 
which is $25 billion, according to the Social Security Administration, 
would responsibly address it.
  Now, I wish it was paid for. We don't pay for anything in this town. 
$25 billion at least addresses it responsibly.
  What has happened, this legislation that we are voting on--the 
gentleman is correct--under suspension of the rules, without going to 
the Rules Committee, I disagree with that. It should not be being done 
under suspension. The reason it is being done under suspension is 
because a majority of people in this body discharged another bill, H.R. 
82, which would spend $200 billion over 10 years to reinstate the 
windfall, to basically take money away from Social Security and make it 
be bankrupt 6 months earlier. That is what this town does.

  My friend from Texas is trying to prevent that. We had to engage in 
political rulemaking warfare on the floor of the House, which we 
addressed today to try to fix it and put the genie back in the bottle, 
to guarantee that we would at least get a vote on this good bill 
instead of the disaster that is a $200 billion hole in the deficit that 
will bankrupt Social Security at least 6 months earlier, according to 
the Social Security Administration.
  I thank my friend from Texas. I rise in support of it. We should not 
have to do this. This should have gone through the Rules Committee. We 
should have amended the bill. We should have a debate about it. We 
should pay for it. Instead, we are doing the same crap we always do. I 
support this bill.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, this will be budget neutral over 75 years 
for the trust fund, according to the actuaries, and I thank Mr. Roy for 
his comments.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I have to say I do agree with Mr. Roy's last statement 
that what we needed to do was go through regular order and what we need 
is to pay for it. That is the responsible thing to do, is to pay for 
it.
  We have a plan to not only repeal WEP and GPO but pay for it. Yes, I 
heard people refer to the Brady-Neal proposal, but Ranking Member Neal 
has a plan also to deal with WEP that is fair and makes sense and is 
something that we should be embracing and including and is paid for. 
That is the big issue today. It is not that people's hearts aren't in 
the right place, and I think the gentleman from Texas understands this.
  All of us are Americans. The President of the United States, Mr. 
Biden, has made a proposal. The incoming President, Mr. Trump, has made 
a proposal also. He has made a proposal to cut taxes for people on 
Social Security. We have that proposal in our bill, except we pay for 
it. That is the responsible thing to do.
  What has been irresponsible is Congress not debating this in regular 
order and bringing it to the floor. How about doing something 
incredible here, actually have a vote on the Nation's number one 
antipoverty program for the elderly and number one antipoverty program 
for our children until the child tax credit is fully adopted, and is 
the program that more veterans rely on for disability than the VA.
  This program is so admired and respected by the American people that 
overwhelmingly Independents, Republicans, and Democrats, all believe 
that it should be supported, expanded, because it hasn't been in over 
50 years, and paid for.
  We have a plan. We are anxiously waiting for the debate and for the 
discussion and the dialogue to take place here in regular order and 
have a vote on a plan that is comprehensive and paid for and lifts the 
5 million Americans who get below-poverty-level checks from the 
government above the poverty level and provides people with the 
opportunity in every single one of our communities to get the benefits 
they richly deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), my colleague and friend.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, the windfall elimination 
provision, or WEP as it is more commonly known, was put in place more 
than four decades ago to prevent workers with earnings that were exempt 
from Social Security payroll taxes from getting more generous treatment 
from Social Security than workers who spent their whole careers 
contributing to Social Security.
  Unfortunately, WEP still results in overly generous payments for some 
while unfairly penalizing others.
  H.R. 5342, the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act, provides 
current beneficiaries affected by the WEP with an additional $100 per 
month and replaces the current-law WEP for future beneficiaries with a 
new formula that bases benefits on a worker's total career earnings.
  This past year, the Ways and Means Committee has held more hearings 
on WEP than in any other Congress in the past 20 years and identified 
that the WEP formula could be replaced with a formula that provides all 
beneficiaries with a fair benefit based on their actual earnings using 
data that wasn't available when the WEP was put in place 40 years ago.

                              {time}  1630

  The bill before us today, the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act, 
replaces the WEP with a new formula based on this now-available 
earnings data to more accurately adjust benefits.
  While I have concerns with this bill's short-term costs, I commend my 
colleagues and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Congressman Jodey 
Arrington, for his dedication to finding a pragmatic solution that 
ultimately improves the financial health of the Social Security 
programs over the long term.
  It is vital that any solution to WEP protects the Social Security 
trust funds that all beneficiaries rely on. I know a very similar 
proposal to permanently replace the WEP used to share bipartisan 
support of members of the Ways and Means Committee, but, unfortunately, 
my Democrat colleagues abandoned this approach several years back.

[[Page H5924]]

  I share the goals of this legislation and encourage my colleagues to 
work with myself and Chairman Arrington to develop a permanent, 
bipartisan solution that permanently fixes the Windfall Elimination 
Provision, and the related government pension offset, while also 
protecting the Social Security benefits of all retirees, which could 
actually pass the United States Senate and become law.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I thank the gentleman from Missouri for his comments. I don't 
know that I could add anything more to what he said. We are trying to 
fix this inequity that exists with this subset of the retirement or 
Social Security beneficiary population.
  I agree with Mr. Larson that we need a broader debate on Social 
Security, and we had better hurry up because it will be insolvent in 
less than 10 years, so we need to talk about the solvency and 
sustainability, the entirety of the program, the pay-fors, programmatic 
reforms, and the benefits. All of it should be on the table.
  That is why as budget chair, I passed a bipartisan fiscal commission 
that would look at that and also at Medicare, which is another 
important safety net for seniors. However, we are talking about one 
specific subset.
  I love the gentleman's passion, and I hope that we can get thoughtful 
Members on both sides of the aisle, like my friend, to sit at the table 
and do the right, the responsible, and the mature thing and actually 
work on a compromise solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did, 
and I will bet the gentleman agrees with that.
  However, we are not talking about the entirety of Social Security. We 
are talking about this subset, this subset of people affected by WEP. 
It is about 2 million people. I want to fix that for them. I want them 
to get the money they have earned, because the windfall elimination 
provision wasn't adequate. It didn't use good information. We still 
have people who are shortchanged.
  We still have people getting a windfall, albeit less, when we have 
the ability, the wherewithal, the tools, and the data to actually fix 
it without just eliminating WEP and going back to where the inequity is 
greater than what it is today.
  That is because if the public servants of my State and the 
gentleman's State would get more than they put into Social Security, 
then we accelerate the insolvency. Then we add to the cuts that will be 
automatic on seniors that would be $2,500 in 2033, and we give almost 
no peace of mind and hope for future seniors and our children and 
grandchildren that this important antipoverty safety net program for 
seniors will still be there when they need it.
  Mr. Speaker, it is too easy just to throw money at every problem up 
here when you are borrowing from China, and you have a $2 trillion 
deficit that will double in 10 years. We have higher levels of 
indebtedness than we had when we were fighting Imperial Japan and Nazi 
Germany.
  This country is going to go into the fiscal ditch never to come out, 
never to prosper, never to be offered the American promise, and never 
to lead the free world because we are going to bankrupt it because we 
don't know how to address these problems like every American does in 
their own household, in their businesses, and at the State and local 
level, and that is conducting their business within their means and not 
like there is a money tree at the Treasury Department where they can 
borrow ad infinitum. That is not reality. That is not reality.
  Let's fix it. Let's do it the right way. Let's not add to the debt. 
Let's not add to the inequity. Let's not accelerate the trust fund 
insolvency.
  Then let's do what the gentleman said. I agree with the gentleman. 
Let's be men and women who love this country and are more concerned 
with solving these big problems than staying up here and being called 
Congressman and chairman. Let's do the people's business. I am ready. I 
am ready.
  This is a very finite subset, and we have the solution. It is not 
perfect, but it balances the things that need to be balanced like these 
folks up there would at their homes and like my parents have to do back 
home in Plainview, Texas.
  Taxpayers deserve a voice as much as seniors, and my children deserve 
a voice as much as taxpayers. That is what we are trying to do here.
  I hope we can get my friend's support. I feel like that is about as 
compelling a pitch I can make. I think   John Larson ought to come over 
and fix this the right way with me, then let's get that fiscal 
commission going, get our President to lean into this and do the 
Reagan-Tip O'Neill grand bargain so we can actually solve the bigger 
and broader issues that plague Social Security.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield myself the balance of my time to close.
  I think you gave a very impassioned plea, but I think we have to 
dispense with we are throwing money at the problem. This is money that 
people have paid weekly, biweekly, and monthly out of their paychecks.

  We are not talking about just 2 million people with regard to WEP. We 
are talking about 70 million Americans. They understand this program.
  Frankly, it doesn't need to be studied. It needs to be voted on.
  Where is the plan on your side?
  We have a plan, and God only knows that plan should be subject to 
debate and discussion, but the plan is to enhance Social Security, not 
to cut it, so that people who are currently struggling, people now, 
today, not waiting for a study, but as we speak are getting below 
poverty-level checks.
  You stand there and tell me we are throwing money at them?
  They didn't think it was throwing money when we were paying the money 
out of their paycheck and they put their trust and confidence in the 
United States of America to return to them a benefit that has been the 
number one antipoverty program for the country.
  I don't care what party you are in or who you are, you understand 
what Social Security has meant to you. Social Security is the safety 
net for capitalism. It is what allows entrepreneurialism to succeed, 
for people to take risks, and if they fail unintentionally or 
otherwise, people are disadvantaged or out of work, they are protected. 
We learned that lesson after the Great Depression.
  If you think it can't happen again, it can. In 2008 and 2009, people 
saw their 401(k) become a 101(k), and during that time, that trust fund 
never missed a payment, not a pension payment, not a disability 
payment, and not a spousal or child payment.
  What it needs is Congress to act and Congress to vote. Congress is 
going to go one of two ways. They are either going to enhance the 
benefit and say: Hey, do you know what? This hasn't been adjusted in 
over 53 years, and we recognize we have the responsibility to do that, 
but we haven't acted, and we haven't voted.
  Both sides haven't acted.
  However, now is the time for us to act and to vote and put a plan in 
front of people so that they get the opportunity to choose.
  Have you got a better plan?
  We have got one. We have got one that expands benefits and is paid 
for. We actually have the temerity to ask people who pay nothing to 
actually contribute to Social Security just like they do to this great 
military that we have in this Nation. People don't go out and buy their 
own tanks and their own F-35s. It is long overdue that people in this 
country all contribute their fair share to the process. This is the 
safety net for capitalism and entrepreneurialism in order for us to 
survive. Every single district--every district--is benefited by it. It 
is an economic development plan.
  How do you explain it to people?
  How can you look them in the eye and say: I am sorry we couldn't do 
anything for you, even though your districts all receive over $200 
million, and yet we haven't done anything to enhance that?
  These were suggestions that they take less while they are living 
longer?
  Where do they spend that money?
  They spend that money right back in your district at the local 
pharmacy, at the grocery store, paying their rent and mortgages, and at 
the dry cleaners. It all goes back to the American people and allows 
our economy to flourish.
  The brilliance of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is still with us today. 
It is

[[Page H5925]]

obstinate of Congress to not vote to enhance people's benefits in more 
than 50 years.
  Ask anyone in your district: Have things changed for them since 1971? 
Could they use a little help from their Congress?
  How many do you think even understand there is a cap on Social 
Security?
  Are we proposing that we lift the cap on people making over $400,000 
and that they actually would have to pay the same thing as someone who 
is making $30, $50, and $100,000?
  They all pay.
  Isn't that the fair thing to do in the country so that all of your 
constituents and mine and all 435 Members of this body can make sure 
that we are taking care of the people whom we are sworn to serve, 
especially those who are already retired, those who are there now?
  While I respect the intention of the gentleman, 14 million people's 
benefits get cut under your proposal--14 million. That is not 
acceptable.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their 
comments to the Chair.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, only in Washington, D.C., and, 
unfortunately--I respect my Democrat colleague and many of my Democrat 
colleagues--only from the Democrat side of the aisle could I hear that 
paying above and beyond what we defined as an earned benefit and has 
now become a windfall for 2 million people at the expense of 60 million 
people who don't receive the same benefit so that we can give people 
equal treatment and not accelerate the insolvency, only in this town 
could I hear that as a solution. That is not a solution. It is a bad 
plan. Let's have the broader debate about Social Security, which is 
what the gentleman is suggesting, but let's fix this.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1645

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the

gentleman from Missouri?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness 
Act of 2023, which fully repeals Social Security's windfall elimination 
provision and government pension offset.
  The WEP and GPO are two Social Security policies that adjust benefits 
for workers who receive a pension from jobs that were exempt from 
Social Security payroll taxes, frequently police officers, 
firefighters, teachers, and other public servants. These two provisions 
affect around 4 percent of all Social Security beneficiaries, more than 
60 percent of whom are concentrated in 10 States.
  These two policies were put in place more than four decades ago to 
prevent workers with earnings that were exempt from Social Security 
payroll taxes from getting more generous treatment from Social Security 
than workers who spent their whole careers contributing to Social 
Security. Unfortunately, these policies still result in overly generous 
benefits for some while unfairly penalizing others.
  This Congress, the Ways and Means Committee has held more hearings on 
WEP and GPO than any other Congress over the past 20 years.
  At our first hearing, held at a fire station in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, we heard directly from American retirees who have been 
affected by these flawed provisions, which took most of them completely 
by surprise.
  At our second hearing, we identified that there are alternatives to 
the current WEP and GPO formulas, using data which wasn't available 
when those two provisions were put in place 40 years ago, which would 
provide all beneficiaries with a fair benefit based on their actual 
earnings.
  Mr. Speaker, while the Social Security Fairness Act repeals the 
flawed WEP and GPO, it is far from being a perfect solution and does 
nothing to replace them with a fair formula.
  Unfortunately, without a replacement, this bill is projected to cost 
Social Security almost $200 billion over the next 10 years and expedite 
Social Security's insolvency by about 6 months. When that happens, it 
is projected that all beneficiaries, not just those affected by the WEP 
and GPO, will receive a 20 to 25 percent benefit cut.
  The WEP and GPO are flawed, but they were put in place for a reason: 
to try to fairly account for workers holding jobs both outside and 
inside the Social Security system.
  I think everyone agrees they have done an imperfect job in treating 
all workers fairly, and that is certainly something we need to fix. 
However, to get rid of them without a replacement potentially trades 
unfair treatment for preferential treatment.
  Like many of the Members who support this legislation, I share the 
goal of providing real relief to those who are harmed by these unfair 
Washington rules, which is why it is unfortunate that this legislation 
had to come to the floor this way. I would have much rather had a 
bipartisan solution that came

[[Page H5926]]

to the floor through regular order that both repealed this formula but 
also replaced it while holding retirees and current workers harmless. 
It is why I appreciate that while the gentleman could have filed a 
Consensus Calendar motion for H.R. 82 more than 460 days ago, 
Representative Garret Graves instead chose to work in good faith with 
the committee to find an alternative that is fully paid for.
  Unfortunately, Democrats and key stakeholders were ultimately 
unwilling to come together and identify a real bipartisan solution that 
would protect both those harmed by the WEP and GPO and the Social 
Security trust fund, which all beneficiaries rely on.
  Mr. Speaker, if Members don't want to be right back here next 
Congress, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with 
us to fix this issue moving forward and protect the retirement security 
of all American seniors.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I commend Representatives Abigail 
Spanberger and Garret Graves for their extraordinary work. It is not 
often in this body, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues are going to find a 
bipartisan group of more than 300 Members who sign on to a proposal. 
Why? Well, my colleagues did it because of how dead wrong WEP and GPO 
are and because of the impact on schoolteachers, firefighters, police 
officers, and municipal employees. That is why it is so heartening to 
see colleagues on both sides of the aisle come together and say, yes, 
there is a path forward, and yes, WEP and GPO need to be reformed and, 
in fact, eliminated.
  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the chair. We need regular order. We need 
regular order because Social Security needs to be addressed 
comprehensively. If not for the work of Ms. Spanberger and Mr. Graves, 
we wouldn't even be here. There would be no dialogue, no discussion, no 
debate on the number one antipoverty program for the elderly and the 
number one antipoverty program for children, a program that protects 
spouses and their children, which every American agrees with and 
understands.
  Congress hasn't acted to expand a program and, in this case, hasn't 
acted to help people who actually worked other jobs and paid into a 
system and are being wrongfully penalized, which is why, in our 
proposal of Social Security 2100, we repeal it, as well, and pay for 
it.

  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the chairman. We didn't have all the data 
over 40 years ago. Now, we do, and now, we have that opportunity. We 
also have the momentum in a body that recognizes that not only is this 
unfair, but to have 5 million fellow Americans get below-poverty-level 
checks is unfair. To not have increased or enhanced benefits in over 50 
years is unfair. To not have a COLA that actually reflects what seniors 
spend their money on is also unfair. To tax Social Security with 
regular income after you have retired is unfair.
  It needs to be addressed. I thank the Members who have done this and 
have brought this, and we need to respond comprehensively. I will add 
that we need to pay for it as well, but the Members who have strove to 
bring this to the floor deserve tremendous credit.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. 
Spanberger).
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Representative for 
tens of thousands of Virginians whose earned retirement benefits have 
been slashed by the windfall elimination provision and the government 
pension offset for far, far too long.
  I urge my colleagues, 330 of whom have cosponsored this legislation, 
to join us in passing the Social Security Fairness Act this evening and 
put an end to this theft.
  For generations, hardworking Americans have been promised that if 
they work hard, save, and contribute to their Social Security, they 
will be afforded a secure retirement with their earned benefits.
  The WEP and the GPO, two misguided provisions that were added to the 
Social Security Act in 1983, have denied Americans the retirement 
security they worked for and expected to receive.
  Today, the WEP steals benefits from more than 2 million retired 
Americans, more than 45,000 Virginians, who both paid into Social 
Security for long enough to earn these benefits and worked in the 
public sector during their careers. These are firefighters who worked a 
second job to make ends meet, police officers who began a second career 
after leaving the force, and teachers who took a summer job to cover 
the bills and buy school supplies. They are Federal employees who went 
on to work in the private sector. They are all receiving a fraction of 
their earned Social Security benefits.
  The GPO denies benefits to more than 750,000 Americans and nearly 
8,000 Virginians, people who dedicated their careers to public service 
who were then robbed of the survivor benefits that they should have 
received while dealing with the death of a spouse. These Americans have 
been punished simply because they chose to selflessly serve our 
communities and our country.
  Mr. Speaker, I have heard from thousands of Virginians about this 
issue. Francis, a retired police officer in Virginia, is seeing his 
benefits slashed by the WEP. Richard, a veteran who served our Nation 
first in the military, then in civil service, and then in the private 
sector, sees nearly half of his Social Security benefits stolen. That 
has been the case for the past 15 years, even though he started working 
when he was 16 years old and started paying into Social Security.
  For more than 40 years, public servants have tirelessly implored 
their Representatives in Congress to listen to their stories and to 
correct this glaring injustice. Today, for the first time, Congress 
will vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, to repeal the WEP and 
the GPO, and to finally put an end to this theft.
  Let me be very clear. The long-term solvency of Social Security is an 
issue that Congress must address, and the issue of how much those 
earned benefits pay to those who are in their retirement is something 
that must be addressed, but that is a separate issue.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Virginia.

                              {time}  1700

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, that is a separate issue from allowing 
Americans who did their part, who contributed their earnings, for them 
to retire with dignity.
  In signing their names onto this legislation, more than 330 lawmakers 
on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, have made clear 
their belief that we must repeal the WEP and GPO. We must pass it 
tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this 
legislation and in sending it over to the United States Senate, where 
61 Senators who are currently serving in that body are cosponsors of 
our legislation. By passing the Social Security Fairness Act, we can 
deliver long-overdue relief to the American public, to our public 
servants, to those who have served our communities.
  I thank everyone who will speak on behalf of this bill this evening. 
I thank my cosponsor, Congressman Garret Graves, for his extraordinary 
partnership as we have worked with public servants from around the 
country to get to this point tonight.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the author of 
this legislation.
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I listened to this debate and heard so many things that 
are simply misunderstandings or maybe just intentionally telling things 
that aren't true.
  When I was growing up, my mom used to ask me: ``Is it going to take 
an act of Congress for you to clean your room?'' She would say it all 
the time. ``Is it going to take an act of Congress for you to clean 
your room?'' I didn't know what she meant because I thought my room was 
pretty clean.
  What she meant is: Is it going to take the Earth, wind, stars, and 
mountains all moving in order for you to act?
  Mr. Speaker, this has been 40 years of treating people differently, 
discriminating against a certain set of workers.

[[Page H5927]]

These are police officers, teachers, firefighters, and other public 
servants. Mr. Speaker, I worked side by side with these folks. They are 
not people who are overpaid. They are not people who are underworked.
  Think about the crime issue, the defund the police issue, the safety 
of our communities. Police officers are integral to our State. They are 
integral to our Nation. We need to treat them fairly, respectfully. 
That means not treating them differently and discriminating against 
them and their benefits.
  Teachers are the ones who train the next generation. Firefighters--
who are you going to call when your house is on fire? These are the 
very people whose benefits we are cutting.
  Mr. Speaker, I have heard people sit here and say the solvency of 
this Social Security trust fund is going to move forward 6 months with 
this bill. Mr. Speaker, the solvency has been delayed years because you 
have stolen from these people. Do you not understand math? This number 
right here--the Congressional Budget Office, $195 billion--do you know 
what that number is? That is the number that you are going to be 
stealing from these same public servants over the next 10 years if you 
don't fix this.
  Mr. Speaker, we can sit here and talk about all of these numbers and 
math. Here is the reality. Probably somewhere between $600 billion and 
$700 billion in Social Security benefits from police officers, 
teachers, firefighters, and other public servants has been stolen. If 
we don't pass this, the Congressional Budget Office says we are going 
to steal another $995 billion.
  An interesting nugget that was in the Congressional Budget Office's 
evaluation is they also said if we actually pass this law, we are going 
to save money on social welfare programs because we are going to lift 
people out of poverty. They will no longer be dependent upon our social 
welfare programs.
  Mr. Speaker, we can't keep doing this. I heard people talking about 
penalizing people and taxes and all of that stuff. Let me tell you what 
is happening. There is a group of people right now that effectively is 
paying a higher tax than anyone else. That is what is happening. It is 
the reason why the Social Security trust fund is going to remain 
solvent for years longer. It is unfair. It is unjust.
  Mr. Speaker, I am going to say it again. This is a community of 
people who cannot afford this. This is a community of people who are 
some of the hardest working folks in our community, and they have been 
stolen from for 40 years.
  Mr. Speaker, very simply, here is the scenario. Let's say that 
Chairman Smith and I were both security guards. We were paid the same 
amount of money over the same period of time. After 20 years, I say 
that I am out. I go back and help raise a family. Chairman Smith goes 
on to become a sheriff's deputy. He does it for 10 years.
  When we retire on the same exact date, my Social Security benefits 
may be $1,500 to $1,800 more. Why? We paid the same amount for same 
period of time into the Social Security trust fund.
  Mr. Speaker, look, there are folks who have tried to throw up other 
legislation and say that these other alternatives are the right way to 
go. There is one bill in this Congress that has a majority of 
Republicans and a majority of Democrats. I don't know the number right 
now. I know that, recently, it was the most cosponsored bill in all of 
Congress. With over 12,000 bills introduced, it was the most 
cosponsored bill.
  Mr. Speaker, do you know what? We didn't go through the regular 
committee process. I do want to thank Chairman Smith for working with 
us. Do you know what we did? We had a hearing in Louisiana. We had a 
hearing in Washington, D.C. We negotiated for months, trying to get 
there. We couldn't.
  Mr. Speaker, there is one package that has the support of the 
majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats that will fix 
this once and for all. How in the world are we trying to beat up on the 
bill that is the most cosponsored bill in Congress?

  My friend, Mr. Larson, was talking about the divisiveness, the 
polarization. My gosh, we have finally come together on something.
  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill. Let's show America that we can do 
what is right and what is just. Let's make sure this bill gets through 
the Senate and to the President's desk and that it doesn't take another 
40 years to do what is right.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Budzinski).
  Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democratic colleague for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 82, the 
Social Security Fairness Act.
  Right now, millions of Americans who have paid into Social Security 
are being cut short in their benefits. Police officers, firefighters, 
and educators, working people who have devoted their professional lives 
to public service, are being unfairly punished by the windfall 
elimination provision and the government pension offset.
  Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Fairness Act is a bipartisan bill to 
fix this, restoring benefits that our public servants have paid into 
throughout the years and ensuring that every American receives the 
Social Security benefits that they have earned and deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to 
come together this evening to support this legislation so that we can 
give these working people the retirement security that they have worked 
for and earned.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, Congress frequently falls 
short of the will of we the people. We know this as Representatives. We 
struggle to do our best. Rarely do we have an opportunity to set things 
right. I have worked for 8 years on the Social Security Fairness Act, 
and tonight, it comes to the floor for a vote.
  Mr. Speaker, tonight, we can repeal the unrighteous law. Tonight, men 
and women of this Chamber, of this honored body, can recognize the 
significance of their signature and can honor their own signature and 
cast a vote in support of H.R. 82.
  Mr. Speaker, I have watched Congress after Congress after Congress as 
this bill has been skillfully and deviously killed in every Congress by 
one means or another. There is an echo through the Chamber of: ``There 
is a better bill pending. We will get it next Congress. There is a more 
conservative bill in the Senate. We can't pass this bill. It won't see 
the light of day in the Senate.''
  Mr. Speaker, we shall shine the light of the American people upon 
this body and upon the Senate. We demand a clean vote. This is why we 
have forced it. By God, we shall get it. It is totally unrighteous to 
state that we can use seized and stolen money to address our ledger as 
a nation.
  Mr. Speaker, we must stop the unrighteous theft. H.R. 82 has my full 
and vigorous support. It carries the signatures of over 300 Members of 
this people's House. I expect its passage tonight.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Landsman).
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who has worked so hard on 
this bill for as long as they have. It has been years, way too long.
  Tonight is a bill vote. This is one of the most significant votes as 
a new Member I have been a part of because of the impact it will have 
on millions and millions of working people and public retirees. It is a 
huge win for them.
  Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act will help 
over 160,000 people in Ohio alone. As has been said, these are people 
who served us. These are retired teachers, retired police officers, 
retired firefighters, retired nurses, and our letter carriers.
  They have paid into the system like everyone else, but they don't get 
all of their benefits. As has been said, this is theft.
  Mr. Speaker, I am going to tell one quick story about a woman named 
Melissa from my district. She has been teaching kindergarten at a 
public school.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. D'Esposito). The time of the gentleman 
has expired.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, she has taught public school for 20 years.

[[Page H5928]]

When she retires next year, she is set to lose $2,000 a month that she 
has earned because of this provision.
  She is not alone. As I mentioned, there are over 160,000 others in 
Ohio and millions across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, this is the most cosponsored bill in the United States 
Congress. There are more than 60 Members of the Senate who will pass 
this bill or at least have said that they will pass this bill.
  With our vote tonight, it will get sent to the Senate. It will become 
law. It will make an enormous difference in the lives of working 
people, public retirees, so that they can pay all of their bills.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back on the floor of the 
U.S. House of Representatives. We wrapped up our election season last 
Tuesday. I participated in debates. Other people participated in 
debates.
  We are all ready to go after that inflation, that inflation driving 
up food costs, driving up housing costs, driving up the cost of 
gasoline. We are ready to get back here and be a little responsible.
  Mr. Speaker, what is the first bill up, the first bill on the first 
day? It is a bill that is going to cost just short of $200 billion, not 
cut $200 billion, as we try to strengthen the dollar. It is going to 
cost $200 billion.
  It is illuminating that the most cosponsored bill is a bill that will 
add another $200 billion to the country's debt, but that is the 
situation that we are in.
  Mr. Speaker, let's forget about the flowery language here. Now is the 
first opportunity to say no to spending. I was anticipating this 
biennium. We fight over bills worth $500 million or $1 billion. Now, we 
have a bill before us for $190 billion, and everyone says it is time 
to, in a bipartisan way, spend more. The average American is already 
$100,000 in debt.

                              {time}  1715

  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please remember the promises 
about excessive spending that we were all saying just 2 weeks ago and 
please vote against this bill.
  I don't know what is going to happen to me if the first thing the 
Republicans do after coming back after this election season is pass a 
bill that is going to cost $200 billion. Remember, the current system 
is built to provide a benefit for the low earner. These folks already 
have a pension and knew what the situation was going to be. Please 
don't spend $200 billion.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I will point out as well that 
the Social Security trust fund is not part of the national debt. This 
proposal does not run up the national debt. It impacts the trust fund.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
Hoyle).
  Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, my father was in the fire service 
when this was passed in 1983. He retired in 1991, and because of this 
wrong, he will get less than people who have private pensions simply 
because he chose to protect and serve our community.
  I agree with what has been said earlier. We need to fix what is 
broken and do it the right way. It is why I believe we should pass the 
Social Security Expansion Act, so that we can extend the solvency of 
Social Security. That is not what is on the floor today.
  I could say a lot of things, but I think my cousin said it best. He 
called me when I was on the way here. He is suffering permanent health 
effects from the time he spent at the World Trade Center after 9/11 and 
for the time he spent in the fire service running into fires when 
everybody else was running away. He said, public employees, police 
officers, teachers, firefighters, and their spouses are punished for 
our commitment to serve our community. While trust fund babies and day 
traders get their full benefits, we do not. This is only part of the 
solution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon.
  Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. He said, Val, tell them they need to pass this 
bill. It is time to right this wrong. We have earned our benefits.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. Speaker, it is rare when you see in this body the number of 
people who have come together to support a bill. I think it 
demonstrates overwhelmingly how badly we need to come together and pass 
legislation that impacts the American people. We see so many of them as 
was so eloquently stated by so many speakers today, especially Mr. 
Graves and Mr. Higgins, saying how these individuals have had money 
taken out of their paychecks and receive nothing. It is wrong. We all 
know that it is wrong. It needs to be corrected, and it needs to be 
paid for.
  I respect the idea and notion that we have to be fiscally 
responsible, but Social Security, the trust fund, is so solid but for 
one thing: the inaction of the United States Congress for more than 53 
years failing the American people, failing to do the right thing for 
teachers, for firefighters, and for police officers.
  I will bet everybody here has heard from the firefighters' union and 
from the teachers' union and from others who are standing up and 
saying, this is flat-out wrong. They are absolutely right, but there 
are other people that are hurt as well when items aren't paid for.
  Who is here to speak for the 5 million Americans who get below-
poverty-level checks from the wealthiest Nation in the world? Who 
speaks for them? Who speaks for the more than 33 million Americans who 
the only benefit that they have is Social Security?
  As proud as I am of the speakers on our side who have talked about 
the need to address this issue for people that have been hurt and 
disadvantaged, if we don't pay for it we hurt and disadvantage people 
who are in the fund currently by not comprehensively addressing this 
issue and paying for it.
  What that takes is for the discussion to move forward in a manner in 
which it goes through regular order, it is debated in committee and on 
the floor, and then voted on.
  The great news is that there will actually be a vote and there will 
actually be a discussion, and people will have to say, well, why was 
that so and what was the outcome?
  In doing so, hopefully, we will have an understanding about the 
absolute neglect by the United States Congress, both Chambers, to 
address the Nation's number one antipoverty program for our elderly and 
for our children. It is the safety net of capitalism and 
entrepreneurialism. It should be something we are embracing where both 
sides have good points to make, but one of them clearly isn't cutting 
benefits intentionally or unintentionally that end up hurting the very 
people we are sworn to serve, the very people that Social Security was 
meant to protect. The genius of Roosevelt and the Congress back in 1935 
is that they got it. It took a major event like the Great Depression, 
but if you think it can't happen again, think back to 2008 and 2009 
when people's 401(k)'s became 101(k)'s.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people are begging us to do something, to 
have a vote. They are right. These benefits have been taken from them 
that they earned and paid for. They deserve them, but in the process we 
can't hurt those people who we have also neglected. There are 5 million 
fellow Americans in all of our districts getting below-poverty-level 
checks. That is wrong.
  My heart is heavy because I oppose this bill because of who it 
impacts and hurts, but I totally respect the effort in what was done 
and the fact, thanks to the efforts of 300 Members of this body, there 
will at least be a vote, not the vote I would have preferred, but 
a vote.

  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, America's public servants deserve 
to be treated fairly by Social Security, and all of America's seniors 
deserve access to the benefits that they have earned and to live out 
their retirement with dignity. These truths are not mutually exclusive.
  We owe it to those Americans who dedicated their careers to serving 
the public that they are not treated unfairly because of a mistake 
Congress made decades ago. We also have a duty

[[Page H5929]]

to the millions of seniors on Social Security not impacted by GPO or 
WEP to put in place a legislative fix that protects their benefits.
  I will commend my colleague and good friend, Congressman Graves, for 
his tireless work on behalf of these seniors and encourage all of my 
colleagues to consider how this legislation will affect their 
constituents one way or another as they vote.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Graves).
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, this bill has been amazing. I 
will say it again. At one point it has been the most cosponsored bill 
in Congress, 330 cosponsors. This bill has a majority of the majority.
  There is one Social Security fix bill that has a majority of the 
majority as cosponsors. There is one bill that has the Speaker of the 
House as a cosponsor that fixes this. There is one bill that has the 
majority leader of the House as a cosponsor that fixes this. There is 
one bill that will truly solve this problem after 40 years of stealing 
from police officers, from teachers, from firefighters, and others, and 
it is H.R. 82.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, at home a lot of people are probably confused, and, 
quite frankly, a lot of Members of Congress are probably confused.
  Why are there two different bills that we are voting on today?
  I will be very clear: One bill, H.R. 82, actually fixes the problem. 
I appreciate the efforts of my friend from Texas working to try to 
solve this. The bill doesn't do it.
  Let me just give you one little story, one little anecdote, to make 
it clear.
  Today, Mr. Speaker, if you have a police officer killed in the line 
of duty, that widow, that spouse, gets zero in spousal benefits in 
Social Security. If we pass the other bill that was introduced that was 
suddenly thrown up and put on the agenda, if we pass that legislation, 
that spouse will continue to get nothing. The widow of a police officer 
killed in the line of duty, the spousal benefits will still be zero.
  According to all of the groups that are out there supporting this 
legislation that are identified on this poster here, the other bill, 
H.R. 5342, would actually benefit 1 million and result in cuts to 14 
million retirees.
  Let me say it another way. You vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5342, you are 
voting to cut Social Security benefits. If you want to go home and 
explain that, have at it. There is one bill that solves the problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congresswoman Spanberger, for 
being a great partner. I thank Logan De La Barre-Hays, Shaun, Ben, 
Mark, and Maggie Ayrea, and the staff folks for being so helpful. While 
the chairman and I were unable to get to an agreement, a consensus on 
this, I thank Chairman Smith for his tireless efforts to fix this.

                              {time}  1730

  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to say it one more time. There is one 
bill--one bill--that has the support of police officers, teachers, 
firefighters, and all the other retirees. I urge support for H.R. 82.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from the 
Federal-Postal Coalition, the Fraternal Order of Police, the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National 
Association of Police Organizations, the National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, NARFE, the International Association of 
Fire Fighters, and the American Federation of Government Employees.


                                     Federal-Postal Coalition,

                                                November 12, 2024.
       Dear Representative: As Chair of the Federal-Postal 
     Coalition, an organization of over thirty labor unions and 
     management associations representing the interests of current 
     and retired federal and postal employees, I urge you to vote 
     in favor of H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, when 
     it is brought up on suspension.
       As you are aware, the Social Security Fairness Act would 
     repeal the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall 
     Elimination Provision (WEP). These policies from the 1970s 
     unfairly target the earned Social Security benefits of our 
     nation's public servants, including a substantial portion of 
     our country's federal retirees.
       GPO and WEP reduce the hard-earned retirement benefits from 
     public sector employees at the federal, state and local 
     levels whose work is not covered by Social Security. GPO 
     targets and reduces spousal and survival Social Security 
     benefits, which disproportionately impacts widows and 
     widowers. Currently, widow's benefits are reduced by $2 for 
     every $3 earned if the widow is eligible for a pension based 
     on a public sector job that was not covered by Social 
     Security. WEP can result in a monthly Social Security benefit 
     as much as $512 1ess than under the regular benefit formula, 
     drastically reducing the amount of fixed income for a retiree 
     to live on.
       Repeal of these provisions is long overdue. Social Security 
     is a critical source of income for our nation's retirees, but 
     we have allowed needless discrimination against retired 
     public servants for far too long. These individuals paid 
     Social Security taxes in connection with covered work (e.g., 
     in the private sector), earning their Social Security 
     benefits. Yet because they chose careers in public service 
     and earned a pension through that service, their earned 
     Social Security benefits are significantly reduced--or even 
     eliminated. These penalties discourage public service and 
     hamper the retirement security of those with long careers 
     benefiting this nation.
       Now it is time for the House to take action to address 
     these longstanding inequities and vote yes on H.R. 82.
       Thank you for your consideration.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Katie Maddocks,
     Federal-Postal Coalition Chair.

                                                       AFSCME,

                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2024.
     Members of the House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members 
     of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
     Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to vote in support of the 
     strongly bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act of 2023 
     (H.R. 82) and to reject the Equal Treatment of Public 
     Servants Act of 2023 (H.R. 5342).
       AFSCME supports H.R. 82 because it would fully repeal the 
     Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination 
     Provision (WEP), two provisions that deprive more than 2.8 
     million public employee retirees of Social Security benefits 
     they have earned.
       With 330 co-sponsors, H.R. 82 has robust bipartisan 
     support.
       H.R. 82 would permanently end the injustice in the current 
     calculation of Social Security benefits that harms 2.8 
     million public pensioners and their spouses who paid 
     thousands of dollars into Social Security over decades.
       H.R. 82 would permanently end the Government Pension Offset 
     (GPO) cuts to the spousal and widow(er) Social Security 
     benefits of 750,000 beneficiaries (or about 1% of all 
     beneficiaries). Two out of three of these beneficiaries saw 
     the GPO take away all their spousal or widow(er)'s Social 
     Security check, denying them the retirement security they 
     planned.
       H.R. 82 would permanently end the Windfall Elimination 
     Provision (WEP) formula that can cut a worker's earned Social 
     Security benefit by more than half, up to $587 in 2024. WEP 
     is an indiscriminate penalty that is especially unfair 
     because these workers pay the same percentage in payroll 
     contributions on their Social Security covered earnings as 
     all others. They fully earned these Social Security benefits.
       AFSCME urges Congress to reject H.R. 5342 as it is deeply 
     flawed in key respects.
       H.R. 5342 provides absolutely no relief for the harm caused 
     to spouses and widow(er)s by GPO.
       H.R. 5342 picks winners and losers in calculating benefits 
     for workers affected by WEP. The Social Security 
     Administration Actuary estimated that the bill would slightly 
     increase benefits for 1 million future retirees but decrease 
     benefits for 14 million other future retirees.
       Currently, former public employees who did not vest in 
     their public pension are exempt from WEP reductions to their 
     earned Social Security benefits. H.R. 5342 eliminates this 
     commonsense exemption and would subject 13.5 million more 
     individuals to a WEP cut in Social Security benefits.
       We ask you to permanently end the injustice caused by GOP 
     and WEP by voting in support of the Social Security Fairness 
     Act (H.R. 82) and to reject the Equal Treatment of Public 
     Servants Act (H.R. 5342) so that current and future retirees 
     receive the benefits they have earned.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Edwin S. Jayne,
     Director of Federal Government Affairs.

                                                    of Police,

                                                November 12, 2024.
       The National Fraternal Order of Police is urging Members of 
     the U.S. House of Representatives to vote YES on H.R. 82, the 
     bipartisan ``Social Security Fairness Act.'' The bill has 330 
     cosponsors, including House Leadership on both sides and a 
     majority of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. It 
     would:
       Repeal existing penalties on retired public employees--the 
     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension 
     Offset (GPO).
       Provide relief for about 1.9 million retired public 
     employees who earned a Social Security benefit through their 
     work but are denied the full benefit because of their public 
     service.

       Ensure that Social Security treats all American workers the 
     same--FAIRLY.
       The National Fraternal Order of Police is urging Members of 
     the U.S. House of Representatives to vote NO on H.R. 5342, 
     the ``Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act.'' The bill 
     falls short of true relief/reform because:
       It leaves the Government Pension Offset intact, which 
     reduces the survivor benefits, and, in most cases, completely 
     eliminates the benefit. Of the 735,000 spouses who lost their 
     loved one and who are entitled to a survivor's benefit, the 
     majority of these widow(er)s--511,000 of them--will see their 
     benefit completely offset and will receive nothing.
       The problem with the WEP in existing law is the unfair and 
     arbitrary nature of the formula. Repealing it will treat all 
     American workers the same. This bill just changes the 
     formula--retired public employees would still be treated 
     differently and not get what they earned.

                               Alexandria, Va., November 12, 2024.
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Cosponsors of H.R. 82: On behalf of the National 
     Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing over 
     250,000 sworn law enforcement officers across the country, I 
     am writing to express our sincere thanks to you for 
     cosponsoring H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, and 
     to urge you to turn your support into a vote in favor of this 
     important legislation when it comes up for a vote today. The 
     Social Security Fairness Act is the only legislation that can 
     fix a long-standing wrong that has put millions of our 
     nation's retired public servants in financial insecurity.
       By cosponsoring H.R 82, you demonstrated your understanding 
     of the detrimental impact the Windfall Elimination Provision 
     (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) have on public 
     servants' Social Security retirement benefits. For over 40 
     years, the GPO and WEP have been harming the retirement 
     security of our nation's public safety officers simply 
     because they chose a public service profession by taking away 
     hard-earned and much needed benefits.
       While initially meant as a ``leveling'' response, in recent 
     years the GPO and WEP have been used to prolong the life of 
     the Social Security Trust Fund on the backs of our nation's 
     public servants, who are seeing cuts across the board to 
     their hard-earned retirement benefits. By totally repealing 
     both the GPO and WEP, the Social Security Fairness Act would 
     preserve the retirement security of those who selflessly 
     serve and protect our communities.
       We urge you to continue standing with us in support of 
     restoring the Social Security retirement benefits of millions 
     of public servants across the county and vote yes on H.R. 82 
     when it comes up for a vote today and no on H.R. 5342.
       If you have any questions, or if we can be of further 
     assistance, please feel free to contact me.
           Sincerely,
                                         William J. Johnson, Esq.,
     Executive Director.

                                    National Committee to Preserve


                                   Social Security & Medicare,

                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2024.
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the millions of members 
     and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social 
     Security and Medicare, I am writing to express our strong 
     opposition to H.R. 5342, the ``Equal Treatment of Public 
     Servants Act of 2023'', because it will cut benefits for 14 
     million hard-working future retirees. Members of the National 
     Committee come from all walks of life and every political 
     persuasion. What unites them is their passion for protecting 
     and strengthening programs that are vitally important to 
     older Americans.
       Although H.R. 5342 is being presented as an alternative to 
     H.R. 82, the ``Social Security Fairness Act of 2023'', it is 
     severely deficient in two major ways. First, it leaves intact 
     the current law Social Security Government Pension Offset 
     (GPO) provision, thus leaving hundreds of thousands of 
     beneficiaries, about one-half of whom are widows and 
     widowers, losing up to the entirety of their Social Security 
     benefit. And second, H.R. 5342 would expand rather than 
     reduce the reach of the current law Windfall Elimination 
     Provision (WEP), cutting the benefits of millions of 
     Americans who are not currently affected by the (WEP).
       It is imperative that members of Congress not be misled by 
     the ``hold harmless'' provision that allows American workers 
     to receive benefits under either the current formula or the 
     new one--whichever is higher--for the next four decades. 
     While this is true, other provisions in the bill would result 
     in benefit cuts for millions of hard-working Americans who 
     were never subject to the WEP in the first place. The Social 
     Security Administration's (SSA) Chief Actuary has projected 
     that H.R. 5342 would cut benefits for 14 million future 
     retirees, while raising benefits for only one million.
       While we prefer that the inequities of the GPO and WEP be 
     resolved as part of a comprehensive modernization of the 
     Social Security system such as that proposed by 
     Representative John Larson in the Social Security 2100 Act, 
     the deep flaws in H.R. 5342 make it a completely inadequate 
     alternative to H.R. 82. Unlike H.R. 5342, H.R. 82 completely 
     repeals both the GPO and the WEP, and does not cut benefits 
     for any future retirees.
       The National Committee truly hopes that H.R. 5342 does not 
     represent a blueprint for how the Republican leadership of 
     the House of Representatives intends to address the broader 
     issue of Social Security reform. Cutting benefits for a large 
     number of beneficiaries while providing benefit increases for 
     a minority of workers is simply not acceptable to the 
     majority of the American people. Poll after poll has shown 
     broad, bipartisan support for increasing revenue to stabilize 
     Social Security's finances rather than cutting benefits.
       We strongly urge all members of the House to oppose H.R. 
     5342 and support H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act of 
     2023. Enactment of H.R. 82 will restore the earned Social 
     Security benefits to millions of public servants--including 
     the teachers, police and firefighters who put their lives on 
     the line for our families every day.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Max Richtman,
     President and CEO.

                                       National Active and Retired


                                Federal Employees Association,

                                Alexandria, VA, November 11, 2024.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Active and 
     Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), which is 
     dedicated to advancing the interests of the more than 5 
     million federal employees and retirees, as well as their 
     spouses and survivors, I write to urge you to vote YES on the 
     Social Security Fairness Act, H.R. 82, when it comes to the 
     House floor this week.
       The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the Windfall 
     Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset 
     (GPO), both of which unfairly penalize retired public 
     servants by reducing earned Social Security benefits simply 
     due to their receipt of an earned government pension.
       Throughout the 118th Congress, we have seen historic 
     progress on this legislation, demonstrating the broad support 
     for ending these unfair penalties. H.R. 82 has garnered 
     overwhelming bipartisan support with 330 cosponsors, making 
     it the most supported bill in all of Congress. The House Ways 
     and Means Committee held two hearings on WEP and GPO repeal, 
     where the committee heard compelling testimony from public 
     servants--including teachers, police officers, firefighters, 
     and federal workers--who detailed the severe financial 
     impacts these provisions have on their lives.
       For nearly four decades, WEP and GPO have reduced--or 
     entirely eliminated--earned Social Security benefits for 
     public servants solely because they received a government 
     pension. The WEP can cut monthly Social Security benefits by 
     as much as $587, while the GPO often eliminates spousal or 
     survivor benefits completely. These cuts create substantial 
     financial burdens, forcing many retirees to consider 
     returning to work just to make ends meet. No former public 
     servant who dedicated their career to serving their country 
     with dignity and honor should face this reality.
       Now is the time for Congress to repeal these provisions 
     once and for all. By voting in favor of H.R. 82, you will 
     help restore the benefits these individuals rightfully earned 
     and provide them with the financial security they deserve in 
     retirement. This is a pivotal moment for public servants 
     across the nation, and your support is critical to ensuring 
     justice and fairness for those who have served our 
     communities and our country.


         H.R. 5342, the equal treatment of public servants act

       I also urge you to vote PRESENT on H.R. 5342, the Equal 
     Treatment of Public Servants Act, which is also scheduled for 
     a vote.
       In comparison to H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, 
     this bill would only provide limited relief from the WEP, and 
     no relief at all for those impacted by the GPO. While NARFE 
     has supported H.R. 5342 in the past as one plausible path to 
     providing an improvement over the status quo, we strongly 
     prefer full repeal of both WEP and GPO, and oppose 
     consideration of the bill side-by-side with H.R. 82, 
     especially when it has not earned floor time through majority 
     support for a discharge petition nor committee approval.
       H.R. 5342 is only receiving a vote because two rogue 
     members of the House took unauthorized action during a pro 
     forma session of the House, ignoring longstanding 
     parliamentary precedent, and the authority of every other 
     member of Congress to vote on actions of the House, 
     threatening the procedural integrity of the House of 
     Representatives as a body. By taking unauthorized action, 
     they spoke for the entire House as just two members, 
     nullifying your vote on behalf of your constituents. A vote 
     of PRESENT takes no position on the underlying bill, yet 
     signals an objection to consideration of the bill, and 
     protests the actions of two rogue members.
       For these reasons, I once again urge you to vote YES on 
     H.R. 82, and PRESENT on H.R. 5342. Thank you for your 
     consideration of our views.
           Sincerely,
                                              William Shackelford,
                                               National President.

       Dear Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries: On behalf of the 
     more than 352,000 members of the International Association of 
     Fire Fighters (IAFF), thank you for bringing the Social 
     Security Fairness Act (H.R. 82) to a vote on the House Floor. 
     With this vote, the House is poised to make the pivotal 
     decision to restore a dignified retirement to countless 
     retired fire fighters, emergency medical workers, and other 
     public servants. I urge you and your colleagues to vote YES 
     on H.R. 82, and end the misguided denial of benefits that has 
     robbed these men and women of their rightfully-earned 
     benefits.
       Every day, fire fighters and emergency medical workers risk 
     their lives and well-being for the greater good. They spend 
     their careers serving our communities, often juggling 
     multiple jobs to support their families--generally while 
     paying into Social Security based on their private-sector 
     earnings. These men and women rightfully expect to receive 
     full Social Security benefits in retirement. The cruel 
     reality is that the WEP and GPO strip away nearly $500 per 
     month from these retirees, leaving them to struggle in 
     retirement.
       The House now holds the power to stand up for these brave 
     men and women. Voting YES on H.R. 82 will restore dignity and 
     fairness to retirees' lives and prove that their sacrifices 
     are honored. This is your chance to make a lasting impact and 
     help the first responders who have given our nation so much. 
     IAFF members are simply asking for fairness and to receive 
     the benefits that they have paid into and earned throughout 
     their careers.
       Our union deeply appreciates your work to build a safer and 
     more dignified fire service. Passing H.R. 82 will ensure a 
     system that is fair for public servants and allows retirees 
     to have the retirements that they have earned. I urge you and 
     your colleagues to continue supporting retired fire fighters 
     by voting to pass H.R. 82. Let's get this bill to the Senate 
     and call upon them to follow your lead.
           Sincerely,
                                                  Edward A. Kelly,

     federal and District of Columbia employees at over 70 
     different agencies, I write to offer our strong endorsement 
     of H.R. 82, the ``Social Security Fairness Act of 2023,'' and 
     our strong opposition to H.R. 5342, the ``Equal Treatment of 
     Public Servants Act of 2023,'' and urge you to vote for H.R. 
     82 and against H.R. 5342 when they are considered on the 
     House floor today.
       H.R. 82 would eliminate the Windfall Elimination Provision 
     (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO), penalties that 
     unfairly deny workers, their spouses, and their children the 
     Social Security benefits earned through their FICA payroll 
     tax contribution. Social Security benefits are modest, but 
     enough to keep millions of seniors, children, disabled 
     individuals and their families out of poverty. The WEP and 
     GPO unfairly target Social Security benefits earned by public 
     service workers, including teachers, police officers, 
     firefighters and hundreds of thousands of federal retirees 
     under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). In total, 
     more than two million Americans have their earned benefits 
     reduced or eliminated by the WEP and around 800,000 Americans 
     have benefits reduced or eliminated by the GPO. These 
     penalties disproportionately affect lower-income workers. 
     About 68 percent of those impacted by the GPO have their 
     benefit fully offset, which means they lose every penny of 
     their promised Social Security benefit. That is why we stand 
     with the 330 bipartisan cosponsors in supporting H.R. 82.
       H.R. 5342, the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 
     2023 is deeply flawed and would hurt millions of more people 
     than it helps. While the bill would slightly increase 
     benefits for nearly one million future retirees, it would 
     decrease benefits for 14 million retirees. The bill also does 
     nothing to provide relief from the unfair GPO. Finally, this 
     bill eliminates an important exemption from WEP for former 
     public employees not receiving a government pension.
       AFGE fully supports H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness 
     Act and encourages you to vote in favor of this much needed 
     legislation. We also urge you to vote against H.R. 5352, 
     which would enact new penalties harming public servants and 
     their families.
           Sincerely,
                                                    Julie Tippens,
                                          Director of Legislation.

  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, all of these groups are 
supporting this bill and urging a ``no'' vote on the other bill, H.R. 
5342.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 82, 
the Social Security Fairness Act. This bill is a critical step to 
ensure fair treatment for hardworking Americans who have dedicated 
their lives to public service. In Virginia alone, nearly 8,000 
individuals are unfairly impacted by the Government Pension Offset, and 
over 46,000 Virginians suffer from reduced Social Security benefits due 
to the Windfall Elimination Provision. These provisions penalize 
teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other dedicated public 
servants, denying them benefits they have rightfully earned. We must 
correct these inequities. Most public servants aren't in it for the 
money--rather, they've decided to work in government because they want 
to serve their country. For their dedication to service, they should be 
rewarded, not penalized for their well-earned pension.
  Those affected by WEP and GPO are unfairly penalized because these 
provisions reduce or even eliminate Social Security benefits for 
retirees who have paid into the system over the course of their 
careers. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) decreases Social 
Security benefits for individuals who receive pensions from jobs not 
covered by Social Security, such as teachers or local government 
workers, regardless of their income or total lifetime contributions. In 
reality, this results in a situation wherein workers who have paid into 
the system but split their careers between covered and non-covered 
employment see a disproportionate reduction in benefits.
  The Government Pension Offset (GPO) adds to this unfairness by 
reducing spousal or survivor benefits by two-thirds of the individual's 
government pension, affecting many retirees who rely on spousal 
benefits for financial stability. This provision especially impacts 
lower-income retirees, such as widows, who can lose most or all of 
their benefits simply because they served in public-sector roles. In 
short, these provisions punish individuals and their families for 
dedicating their lives to public service, and make it harder for such 
individuals to have a secure retirement.
  Through this bill, which repeals WEP and GPO, we can provide much-
needed relief to public sector retirees and their families who often 
rely in part on Social Security benefits for financial security. This 
bill is about fairness, equity, and honoring our commitment to 
individuals who have served their communities. As such, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 82.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

                          ____________________

    STOP TERROR-FINANCING AND TAX PENALTIES ON AMERICAN HOSTAGES ACT

  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 9495) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to

organizations, and for other purposes, as amended.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.


                             General Leave

  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and insert extraneous material on this bill under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Missouri?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 9495, brought forward 
by Representatives Tenney, Kustoff, and Schneider of the Ways and Means 
Committee, as well as Representative Titus of Nevada.
  This bill is about stopping the abuse of the tax code by 
organizations that support terrorism and ensuring that those who are 
held against their will by foreign governments or terrorists don't 
suffer further from tax penalties when they return home to America.
  In the wake of Hamas' brutal attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, we 
have discovered material support for terrorist organizations like Hamas 
right here in the United States, much of which has been funded by tax-
exempt organizations receiving money from American taxpayers.
  Tax-exempt status must be denied to any entity found to have provided 
material support to a terrorist organization. We must starve the 
aggressors of the resources they need to commit more atrocities.
  At the same time, Hamas is still holding hostages in Gaza, including 
American citizens, kidnapped by the terrorist organization on October 7 
of last year. We must honor the struggle of these victims. 
Unfortunately, they are made to suffer unintentionally due to aspects 
of our tax code.
  When those who are wrongfully detained around the world--whether by 
terrorists or by governments--finally return to America, they could be 
subjected to tax bills, including penalties and interest on taxes that 
went unpaid during their captivity.
  H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American 
Hostages Act, is the much-needed solution to both of these problems.
  Under this legislation, the IRS will be given the tools it needs to 
ensure that American citizens held hostage or wrongfully detained and 
their families do not incur penalties for late tax payments while in 
captivity. American victims and their families already went through a 
nightmare. Tax penalties just add to the harm.
  This legislation would also close the IRS loophole that terrorist 
organizations have exploited for years. It builds on the committee's 
antiterror financing efforts by prohibiting organizations from 
maintaining tax-exempt status if they are found to have provided 
material support or resources to a terrorist or terrorist-supporting 
organization within a 3-year period.
  This issue is devastating. Let me provide two examples. One U.S.-
based tax-exempt organization hired a so-called journalist in Gaza, who 
was a member of Hamas and was literally holding Israelis taken hostage 
on October 7 in his own home. He was paid using tax-exempt funds. He 
was paid using tax-exempt funds. That organization is still operating 
as a tax-exempt organization here in the U.S. today. Even though the 
Ways and Means Committee has called for the revocation of their status, 
the IRS Commissioner has yet to do anything.
  Another tax-exempt organization based in the U.S. financially 
sponsored and funded a foreign group that was just designated by 
Treasury as a sham charity and a funder of terrorism. The IRS once 
again has yet to revoke the sponsor's tax-exempt status.
  This legislation is needed. It received overwhelming bipartisan 
support in the Ways and Means Committee. I look forward to seeing H.R. 
9495 receive even more bipartisan support here on the House floor 
today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes Donald Trump to recklessly impose a 
death penalty on any nonprofit in America that happens to be on his 
enemies list. With this bill, he can destroy the very life of civil 
society in this country, one group after another. Even though the group 
involved that he targets as a ``terrorist-supporting'' group has not 
violated a single law, even though the group or the public have not 
been presented with a shred of evidence for doing this, without 
offering any specific explanation or reason as to why the life is being 
taken out of this civil society group, and without providing a day in 
court, a hearing, and without any meaningful right of appeal, no matter 
how capricious, no matter how unjustified Trump's action may be.
  H.R. 9495 is a repackaged version of legislation that was originally 
filed months ago, with good intentions, including that of some of my 
Democratic colleagues.
  With Trump's election, the conditions have changed. The dangers of 
granting additional power to him are far outweighed by any benefits 
from this bill. This is the same Trump who vowed to be ``dictator on 
day one'' and has declared the greatest danger our country faces today 
is ``the enemy within.''

  This bill is now opposed by a growing number of civil society groups, 
over 120 groups--the ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice, the NAACP, 
Planned Parenthood, the Center for American Progress, the American 
Federation of Teachers--a list that goes on and on--including the 
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

  This legislation is done in the name of stopping financial support 
for terrorism. All of us support stopping terrorism. Like everyone 
here, I have done that, and I have previously voted for this very 
language not once but twice, though the last time it came before our 
committee, I voiced the very same concerns about the lack of due 
process that I voice today.
  Since none of the deficiencies of this bill have been corrected and 
no amendment is offered today, we must reject it.
  If he is on a march to make America Fascist, we do not need to supply 
Donald Trump with any additional weapons to accomplish his ill purpose. 
Our freedoms will not be destroyed in one great blow. No, it will be a 
thousand cuts over the term of this administration, undermining our 
liberties one after another.
  To those who say that this bill only applies to groups that are 
supporting terrorism, consider how very expansive that term can be, 
both at home and abroad. The foreign tyrants who Donald Trump so much 
admires have imprisoned journalists, academics, and rights activists by 
claiming that they are supporters of terrorism.
  State and Federal elected officials in this country have called for 
terrorism investigations or prosecution of major news outlets. Trump 
himself has criticized and labeled any racist activist as terrorist. 
Some have mischaracterized environmental groups as ecoterrorists. Under 
this bill, Trump's list of targets would only be limited by his 
imagination. There are not any guardrails in the bill.
  For example, if Trump claimed that Democrats, myself included, who 
didn't clap enough for him in this Chamber when he gave his first State 
of the Union were traitors, that we were treasonous, we could be 
targeted. He could target organizations that assist refugees for 
harboring terrorists.
  Planned Parenthood or a hospital could be targeted for the alleged 
terror of abortion. An environmental group could be mislabeled as an 
ecoterrorist. A private university that permits too many anti-Trump 
demonstrations could be targeted. A disability rights group that is 
objecting to Trump's interference with the Affordable Care Act could be 
targeted.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, a shelter offering housing to LGBTQ youth 
could be targeted. A Vietnam Veterans of America group that previously 
declared Trump's attacks on Gold Star families disgraceful and un-
American could be targeted.
  Other possible targets might be think tanks that don't happen to 
think the way Trump wanted, groups fighting Christian nationalism, or 
simply any tax-exempt group not viewed as sufficiently pro-MAGA.
  Now, let's talk about the two examples that the chairman just 
referred to. He thinks the IRS Commissioner has not acted swiftly 
enough, and it sounds like perhaps he is right. Well, who do you think 
appointed the IRS Commissioner? His name is Donald J. Trump.
  The defect is not in the law as it exists today, but on the question 
of whether or not there is being proper administration of the law that 
exists today that can deal with terrorism.
  If the real purpose of this bill, as well, were simply to postpone 
tax filing deadlines for the very small number of Americans who have 
been detained hostage, as wrong as that is, our approving right now the 
bill that has lingered here, as Republicans shelved it for 6 months, 
that the Senate approved to do that, to provide them that protection, 
we could put that bill on the President's desk right now.
  The very fact that the Republicans used this claim of helping 
hostages is a subterfuge because what it is really about is empowering 
Trump to do more harm. They are, in essence, holding the hostages 
hostage once again.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President-elect.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, may the record also reflect the 
truth and the facts. The IRS Commissioner, Mr. Werfel, was appointed by 
President Biden, not President Trump. Let's get the facts straight.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. Tenney).
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Stop Terror-Financing 
and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, H.R. 9495.
  The intent of this bill is simple, no American who has suffered the 
injustice of wrongful detention or hostage taking by our adversaries 
should return home to face penalties and interest from their own 
government.
  Under current tax law, individuals who have been held against their 
will can be subject to late tax payment penalties and interest after 
returning home from captivity. Not only does this defy common sense, it 
defies compassion. This is an obvious flaw, and it only worsens the 
trauma of individuals and families who have already faced extraordinary 
challenges.
  In addition to righting this egregious wrong, the bill revokes the 
tax-exempt status for organizations found to be supporting these 
terrorist groups; by the way, an initiative that passed unanimously in 
the House Ways and Means Committee.
  Contrary to what some of my colleagues across the aisle believe, the 
American people do not want hard-earned tax dollars to be funneled to 
terrorist organizations. Numerous House Ways and Means Committee 
investigations have uncovered evidence that groups like Samidoun, for 
example, are actively laundering funds through nonprofit organizations 
to terrorist organizations.

                              {time}  1745

  This comes at an important time as last month marked 1 year since 
Hamas' brutal attack on Israel, with many hostages currently being 
wrongfully detained at the hands of designated terrorist groups like 
Hamas.
  The Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act 
would ensure that American hostages, wrongful detainees, and their 
families are not further burdened with tax penalties and interest for 
circumstances beyond their control.
  While I am thankful that we are taking a pivotal step today to 
correct this injustice, we must continue to fight to secure the release 
of Americans being illegally held abroad like my constituent, Ryan 
Corbett, a wonderful husband and father from Dansville, New York, who 
remains wrongfully detained by the Taliban.
  Ryan Corbett has been wrongfully detained by the Taliban for 825 
days, being held in a 9- by 9-foot basement cell without regular access 
to a bathroom, sunlight, or medical care. Ryan's health is 
deteriorating quickly, and the situation is dire.
  I urge President Biden and Secretary Blinken to do everything in 
their power to bring Ryan home and reunite him with his amazing wife, 
Anna, and their three beautiful children, Ketsia, Miriam, and Caleb.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Jason Smith, Speaker   Mike Johnson, 
and Leader   Steve Scalise for bringing this important bill to the 
floor. I also note that this bill passed unanimously out of the House 
Committee on Ways and Means, including with the support of Ranking 
Member Richie Neal.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the Stop Terror-Financing 
and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act to send a clear message that 
we stand by our fellow citizens who have endured unthinkable 
consequences abroad.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to tell the 
chairman he is absolutely right. I stand corrected concerning the IRS 
Commissioner. That is the only thing I stand corrected on, and I would 
be glad to join him in a further appeal to the current Commissioner if 
the facts are as you say because none of us want to see a dollar, 
profit or nonprofit, going to terrorism.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Beyer).
  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I also stand in opposition to H.R. 9495, 
which would provide this administration and any future administration 
with sweeping, unilateral authority to designate nonprofits as terror-
supporting organizations and strip them of their tax-exempt status with 
no due process and

[[Page H5935]]

without sufficient evidence. The authorities provided in this bill are 
unnecessary and extremely dangerous if they ever fall into the wrong 
hands.
  This legislation would do nothing to improve our ability to combat 
terrorism because there are already numerous legal mechanisms that 
effectively monitor and penalize nonprofits that provide support to 
terrorist organizations. No one in this esteemed body wants any 
nonprofits to direct even $1 to a terrorist organization, and it is 
inappropriate to suggest otherwise.
  In the hands of responsible government, the powers provided in this 
bill are redundant and duplicative. However, history is uncertain. 
Democracies, even ours, can wax and wane. Sometimes we have great 
Presidents, and sometimes we do not.
  Under the leadership of an unscrupulous or authoritarian President, 
it is not hard to imagine how that administration could use the powers 
in this bill to hinder or dismantle organizations they don't like. 
Remember, there would be no due process, no right of appeal, no right 
to see the evidence against them, no path to cure.
  It is deeply unfortunate this bill was combined with commonsense 
legislation--led by my friends, Representatives Dina Titus and Claudia 
Tenney, and me--that would have allowed the IRS to waive or postpone 
fines and fees on taxpayers who have been unlawfully detained or held 
hostage overseas and not been able to pay their taxes on time. I was 
pleased to see that piece of legislation unanimously pass the Senate 
earlier this year. However, its pairing with these deeply controversial 
provisions in H.R. 9495 risks those provisions ever becoming law.
  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 
9495, and I hope that we can find a path forward to provide desperately 
needed relief for Americans who have been wrongfully detained overseas.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a question for Mr. Beyer.
  The bill the gentleman has is the same one that the Senate passed 6 
months ago. Has the gentleman been given any reason why the 
Republicans, if they are so eager to help the hostages, have held that 
bill instead of bringing it up to us to consider and getting it on the 
President's desk right now, this week?
  Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Beyer) to answer my question.
  Mr. BEYER. I have never been given that reason, no.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for responding, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand what is 
controversial about an organization losing their tax-exempt status if 
they are funding terrorism. I don't see how that is controversial, but 
apparently, the prior speakers believe it is controversial.
  It is crystal clear. This legislation has passed out of the House 
with overwhelming support in the past. The Senate has been holding it 
up. The Democrat-controlled Senate has been holding it up. But guess 
what. In a couple of months, it won't be the Democrat-controlled 
Senate.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Takano).
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 9495, 
the so-called Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American 
Hostages Act.
  This legislation would grant the President-elect unilateral power to 
essentially shut down any tax-exempt organization based on any simple 
accusations of wrongdoing--let me repeat: a simple accusation of 
wrongdoing.
  By granting the Treasury Secretary enormous power, the Secretary 
would have the authority to stifle any nonprofit organization that has 
provided ``material support'' to terrorists.
  Granting this broad authority to investigate and strip nonprofits of 
their tax-exempt status paves the way for weaponized action against 
targeted organizations based on their core missions and political 
beliefs.
  Mind you, I do not support organizations giving material support for 
terrorists, but I am concerned about a simple accusation of wrongdoing 
leading to that happening.
  To be sure, nonprofits are already prohibited from providing material 
support to terrorist groups, and this legislation is unnecessary and 
duplicative. I support full enforcement of existing law.
  Under a new President-elect Donald Trump, this proposed law could be 
punitive. The notion of giving President-elect Trump the power to take 
away the tax-exempt status of nonprofits associated with his so-called 
political opponents is staggering. Yet, here we are.
  President-elect Trump before and during his campaign made numerous 
comments regarding his supposed enemies. These so-called enemies 
include individuals, corporations, or organizations that have been 
critical of the former President's policies and comments during the 
past and present.
  Let us consider the case of a reputable organization like the 
Japanese American Citizens League. This nonprofit, tax-exempt 
charitable organization, a 501(c)(3), has done immeasurable work on 
behalf of the community and even our Nation advocating for Japanese 
Americans and other marginalized communities, including arguing against 
the Muslim ban. As a proud Japanese American myself, I am in awe of the 
great contributions that this nonprofit has made.
  Yet, with this legislation before us today, one can predict a 
scenario in which this group may be targeted for supporting Muslims 
should a Trump Muslim ban 2.0 come to fruition.
  Every day in this country, nonprofits are doing incredible work. They 
touch a range of different policy areas and sectors, and with this 
bill, they are at significant risk.
  As written, this bill risks allowing LGBTQ organizations to be 
vulnerable to attack solely due to their collaboration with human 
rights groups in hostile areas. Loss of tax exemption would mean that 
these organizations would be subject to corporate tax rates, increasing 
financial burdens and the likelihood of financial hardship. New tax 
liabilities would divert funds away from core missions and activities, 
therefore impeding the work of supporting initiatives and community 
outreach.
  We all know well that the organizations here that could be implicated 
are going to be based on political repercussions. A chilling effect of 
revoking tax-exempt status could deter other organizations from 
speaking up, essentially curtailing free speech.
  Current law dictates it is already a Federal crime for nonprofits to 
provide this support for these groups, so why are we here today? 
Granting the executive branch such extraordinary power based off of 
unilateral accusations paves the way for significant abuse.
  This bill is a gift to President-elect Trump, wrapped in a bow right 
before the holidays, to seek vengeance on his so-called political 
opponents.
  Organizations such as J Street and the ACLU have come out in strong 
opposition to this bill for good reasons. The potential change in tax-
exempt status would not only impact the financial stability of 
countless nonprofit organizations.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from California.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, the potential change in tax-exempt status 
would not only impact the financial stability of countless nonprofit 
organizations but would severely undermine the ability to carry out 
their core missions of advocating for civil rights and social justice.
  Loss of funding and a reduction of capacity to serve communities 
threaten the survival and effectiveness of these nonprofits. We should 
be uplifting these organizations and not hindering their success.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I will say it once again: It is 
pretty clear this bill gives the IRS the authority it needs to revoke 
tax-exempt status for organizations that provide material support for 
terrorism. That is it. The tax-exempt organizations that aren't 
providing material support for terrorism have nothing to fear.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

[[Page H5936]]

  Mr. Speaker, the ability to demand that no dollars flow from America 
to any terrorist organization has been long recognized in the law as it 
exists today. In fact, the chairman has conceded that when he says his 
complaint is that the IRS has not moved fast enough under existing law.
  This is not a question of inadequate law. It is against the law today 
to provide support to a terrorist organization, be it exempt or 
nonexempt. The question here is whether we should change the law to 
eliminate the right to know the evidence to that effect.
  Is it just the chairman's claim that something is a terrorist 
organization? If it is a terrorist organization, why not present the 
evidence? Why not provide an opportunity for a hearing for that 
evidence to be tested? Why not provide a meaningful right of appeal?
  None of these safeguards are there, and they are lacking for a 
reason. The desire is to be able to weaponize the Treasury with regard 
to these organizations and to do as has happened under one tyrant after 
another in another country to claim that the opponents are terrorists, 
a term that is expansive.
  Unchecked authority to revoke the nonprofit status of such groups 
without cause or due process risks Trump truly weaponizing the Treasury 
Department and destroying civil society organizations across this 
country.
  As David Thompson with the National Council of Nonprofits has said, 
by violating basic due process rights, this bill ``bodes ill . . . 
without input from the charitable sector.''
  As civil society groups have stated, over 120 of them: ``The 
executive branch could use this authority to target its political 
opponents and use the fear of crippling legal fees, the stigma of 
designation, and donors fleeing controversy to stifle dissent and chill 
speech and advocacy.''
  It is not just the denial of tax status; it is the threat of denial. 
It is the use of intimidation, at which our President-elect is an 
expert, to let this be an intimidation of one group after another--a 
church, a social organization that has nothing to do with terrorism but 
can be characterized as such by him.
  That is all it takes. Mr. Speaker, if Trump calls you a terrorist, 
just as he called me a traitor for not clapping long enough for him, 
that is all it takes under this bill. You have no hearing. You have no 
evidence. You have no true appeal rights. The supposed administrative 
provisions, administrative safeguards of this bill, are a total sham.
  Mr. Speaker, after you are found guilty and denied your taxpayer 
status, then you can complain about it. It is based on the principle 
that you are guilty before proven innocent. The process there provides 
no protection whatsoever.

                              {time}  1800

  With regard to helping the hostages, let's be very clear about that. 
For 6 months, we have had in this House the opportunity to pass a 
Senate bill that is word for word a bill that is pending here in the 
House to help the hostages. Why has that not been done?
  The very fact that there is such great interest in the hostages today 
and such total insensitivity over the last 6 months to do anything 
about them tells you that there is an ulterior motive here, that the 
goal is not about helping perhaps a dozen hostage victims' families who 
have gone through hell. It is not about that. It is about placing one 
civil society group after another on the line under a new President to 
use unlimited discretion to attack his political foes.
  We have an opportunity tonight to either advance the cause of fascism 
or to push back against it. We have statements not from Democrats but 
from those who worked closest with President Trump raising concern, 
causing my concern about giving him any additional power.
  After he called the press the enemy of the people, there is concern 
about the impact on the press. So many of our journalist organizations 
now at the local level are nonprofit organizations. To lose their tax-
exempt status is to destroy freedom of the press.
  We know with regard to President-elect Trump, that his appointee, 
General Mark Milley, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
a decorated hero and patriot, referred to Mr. Trump as fascist to the 
core, that his former Chief of Staff, the longest serving Chief of 
Staff, one of those best people in the world that he told us he would 
bring to Washington, said he is certainly an authoritarian, admires 
people who are dictators. He has said that.
  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the time remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The gentleman has 2\1/4\ minutes 
remaining.
  Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward 
the President-elect.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the former Chief of Staff said he is 
certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators, so he 
certainly falls into the general definition of fascism.
  Kelly also said that our President-elect has said that Hitler did 
some good things. I don't want those kinds of good things done here in 
America. I want people that disagree with me, as much as the chairman 
does tonight, from across this country to have the opportunity to have 
their say. I think that a vibrant, diverse, civil society and freedom 
of the press here is vital to the future of American democracy, and I 
don't want to see it snuffed out by one new figure. Let us not tonight 
give a wannabe tyrant the tool of tyranny.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President-elect, including by 
making references to other sources that would have been out of order if 
spoken in the Member's own words.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  In response to the prior speaker's comments of the Senate hostage 
bill that was passed earlier, we had the IRS and we had the Joint 
Committee on Taxation that said there were flaws in how it was drafted. 
This bill fixes those flaws, according to what the IRS said and the 
Joint Committee on Taxation.
  Also, the prior speaker is also a member of the Ways and Means 
Committee, and he knows that according to the Constitution, all revenue 
measures originate in the House of Representatives. That bill is a 
revenue measure that originated in the Senate. That is why we are doing 
this legislation, in order to get it accomplished to follow a very 
important document called the U.S. Constitution.
  There is something terribly wrong when organizations that support 
terrorism can abuse the tax code here in the United States but American 
citizens who are victimized by bad actors abroad can be subjected to 
tax penalties when they return home to America. There is something 
terribly wrong when a so-called journalist in Gaza, who had been hired 
by a tax-exempt organization in the U.S., holds Israelis taken hostage 
in his own home for months.
  There is something wrong when the U.S.-based, nonprofit sponsor of a 
designated sham charity and funder of terrorism still has not had its 
tax-exempt status revoked. There is something terribly wrong when 
families, who have already gone through a nightmare, face tax penalties 
when they get home.
  H.R. 9495 is the answer. It received overwhelming bipartisan support 
in the Ways and Means Committee. I look forward to even more bipartisan 
support here on the House floor today.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Rep. 
Tenney's H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on 
American Hostages Act, which will address a profound injustice faced by 
Americans who return home after being wrongfully detained abroad.
  As Co-Chair of the Hostage Task Force in the House alongside my 
friend Haley Stevens of Michigan, I have seen the unimaginable stress 
and hardships these Americans and their families face while being 
detained firsthand.
  The last thing they should have to worry about when they return home 
is a notice from their own government telling them that they now face 
penalties and fines for missing tax deadlines because of circumstances 
entirely beyond their control.
  This bill fixes that irksome issue and sends a clear message:
  That the U.S. government stands by its citizens when they are put 
through these unthinkable circumstances.
  With this measure, we are standing up for Americans who have already 
been through so much.

[[Page H5937]]

  I am proud to see this commonsense measure come to the floor for 
consideration, and I urge my colleagues to support it so we can ensure 
these Americans have the relief they desperately deserve.
  And, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her leadership on this 
critical need.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9495, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a 
quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not 
present.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.
  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.


                             General Leave

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative

[[Page H5940]]

days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), the chairman of our committee.
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding.
  Our foreign adversaries have been using information technology and 
telecommunications equipment to infiltrate and exploit the systems of 
Federal agencies.
  Congress has worked to address this threat by passing numerous bills 
to prohibit Federal agencies from purchasing or using technology from 
sources of concern.
  This includes legislation to prohibit Federal agencies from using 
telecommunications and video surveillance equipment provided by certain 
Chinese companies, legislation to prohibit Federal agencies from 
procuring electronic products or services that include semiconductors 
produced by certain Chinese companies, and legislation to prohibit 
Federal agencies from buying or using drones manufactured or assembled 
by certain Chinese companies.
  In addition to these outright prohibitions, Congress has already 
previously established the Federal Acquisition Security Council, or the 
FASC.
  The FASC has the authority to recommend that agencies exclude certain 
sources from Federal procurement processes or remove certain 
technologies from Federal information systems. However, Congress must 
have a more active role in directing the FASC to consider the exclusion 
and removal of certain sources of concern from Federal systems.
  This bill, the FASC Improvement Act, authorizes the FASC to issue 
binding removal and exclusion orders when directed by Congress. Such 
new binding removal and exclusion orders would complement the existing 
authorities of the FASC to issue recommendations.
  However, this new authority provides Congress a streamlined and 
standardized process for prohibiting Federal agencies from buying or 
using a source of concern in the future. To carry out this 
responsibility, the FASC needs to have adequate support and be 
appropriately resourced.
  H.R. 9597 provides this support by strengthening the governing 
structure of the FASC by moving it into the executive office of the 
President and elevating the FASC's agency membership requirements.
  This bill expands the FASC's focus to include acquisition security 
more broadly, beyond its current narrower focus on supply chain risks, 
and requires the FASC to proactively monitor and evaluate certain 
sources for ongoing risks. This bill also reallocates currently 
authorized appropriations to establish a FASC program within the Office 
of the National Cyber Director.
  This FASC program is authorized to provide the FASC critical 
operational, legal, and policy support it needs to draft and issue 
removal and exclusion orders, such support it currently lacks.
  Importantly, this bill incorporates best practices from the recent 
government-wide procurement prohibitions, including necessary due 
process considerations, national security exemptions, case-by-case 
waiver processes, and second-order prohibitions.
  In other words, the FASC Improvement Act consolidates the past 6 
years of congressional legislation addressing national security 
procurement risks by reforming established processes and expanding 
authorities.
  We need to ensure the executive branch can promptly act to protect 
the Federal supply chain and agency information systems from nefarious 
technology influenced by a foreign adversary.
  This bill will help prevent American taxpayer dollars from supporting 
companies owned or controlled by foreign enemies and hostile actors.
  This bipartisan bill provides the FASC with the teeth and resources 
it needs to protect the Federal supply chain.
  I thank my colleagues, Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jamie 
Raskin, as well as the leadership of the Select Committee on China, 
Chairman Moolenaar and Representative Krishnamoorthi, for partnering 
with me on this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important 
national security bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in support of H.R. 9597, the Federal Acquisition Security 
Council Improvement Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the 
bill.
  I thank the gentleman from Louisiana and Chairman Comer for working 
closely with us on the legislation.
  The bill strengthens the Federal Acquisition Security Council's 
capacity to guard our Nation's supply chains against foreign 
adversaries.
  The council was established in 2018, and this bill would improve its 
governing structure by moving it into the executive office of the 
President and elevating FASC membership requirements.

                              {time}  1815

  The bill would always expand the council's authorities beyond supply 
chain security to include acquisition security more broadly and grants 
the council the authority to issue removal or exclusion orders of 
specific companies when necessary or when directed to do so by the 
United States Congress.
  Finally, our bill would create a streamlined process for Congress to 
designate sources of concern and requires the council to launch an 
investigation into these sources, with appropriate due process 
government-wide input and potential subcontractor prohibitions.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend the staff on both sides of the aisle for their 
creative collaboration on this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I am closing with an admonition to everybody to vote for 
this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. I support the bill, Mr. Speaker, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9597, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

       ``(a) Special Edition for Codification of Agency

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.


                             General Leave

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9592, the Federal Register 
Modernization Act.
  Our government must be both transparent and accountable to the 
American people.
  Laws requiring proper recordkeeping are vital to both. In 1935 the 
Federal Register Act established the Federal

[[Page H5942]]

Register, a daily publication of the Federal Government's activities 
including Presidential documents, proposed and final rules, and public 
notices.
  In other words, the Federal Register provides official notice to the 
public and Congress that an executive branch document exists.
  The Federal Register also provides the building blocks for the Code 
of Federal Regulations, which makes it easier for the American public 
to find and understand the Federal regulations governing our Nation.
  In 1994, the Government Publishing Office began publishing the 
Federal Register online with modern search tools and downloadable 
content.
  Congress has recently taken steps to make the Federal Register more 
efficient by passing the Federal Register Printing Savings Act in 2017. 
However, additional reforms are still needed to alleviate the 
Government Publishing Office of the 1935 law's requirement to print and 
distribute paper copies of the Federal Register every day.
  H.R. 9592 allows the Government Publishing Office to stop wasting 
paper and money and instead publish the Federal Register and the Code 
of Federal Regulations online.
  The bill also streamlines the process for Federal agencies to 
transmit official documents to the National Archives, ensuring a more 
efficient process for making these important Federal documents public.
  Lastly, the bill provides necessary safeguards so that backup 
physical copies are properly stored and alternate publication systems 
can be established in cases of a continuity of government national 
crisis.
  Taken together, these reforms will bring the Federal Register into 
the 21st century and save taxpayer dollars.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
commonsense legislation. I thank my colleague Representative Gerry 
Connolly for partnering with me to ensure these long overdue reforms 
get done, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9592, the Federal Register 
Modernization Act. This bill represents a big step forward in 
streamlining how the Federal Government retains public records and 
communicates with the public.
  The Federal Register Act of 1935 was designed to ensure government 
transparency by requiring publication of Federal laws, Presidential 
proclamations, agency rules, and public notices in the Federal 
Register.
  Today, with the increasing use of digital devices to conduct 
government operations, an electronic edition of the Federal Register is 
published every single business day. The publication of hard copy 
agency document submissions to the Office of the Federal Register 
creates unnecessary redundancy and administrative burdens, and, as my 
friend from Louisiana says, administrative burdens and environmental 
waste.
  In 1936, the Office of the Federal Register published 2,620 pages in 
a year, just over 2,500 pages. By 2023 the Federal Register had 
expanded to more than 90,000 pages in a year. The volume of Federal 
documentation has grown exponentially over the last century, so the 
need for a more efficient and streamlined process is obvious.
  This act would align with the current digital practices of Federal 
agencies and eliminate the need for multiple print submissions.
  This bill allows for electronic only publication of the Federal 
Register except for two print copies maintained by the Office of the 
Federal Register. By maintaining and improving the digital format of 
the Federal Register, the office will operate more efficiently, 
ultimately benefiting not only Federal agencies and the environment but 
also the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I 
have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at 
this time on this bill, and I am prepared to close.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9592, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

remarks and include extraneous material for this measure.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9596, the Value Over Cost Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Donalds).
  Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Value 
Over Cost Act. This is a simple, commonsense piece of legislation that 
modernizes the antiquated Federal procurement process. Specifically, 
this bill provides the General Services Administration with additional 
contracting flexibility by allowing for the consideration of best value 
in addition to the lowest overall cost alternative.
  Instead of just looking at the initial price tag, the Federal 
Government should be fiscally responsible and also consider the 
contractual value of products and services over time, if it is in the 
best interest of the Federal Government.
  Ultimately, my bill increases contractual flexibility and contracting 
competition, provides clarity for acquisition stakeholders, maximizes 
the Federal Government's ability to procure modern technology, and 
helps the small business community by reducing regulatory burdens 
associated with Federal procurement.
  In sum, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense 
piece of legislation.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 9596, the Value Over Cost Act. 
The GSA keeps a list of goods and services that

[[Page H5943]]

are available to Federal agencies for multiple GSA-approved vendors at 
different prices. This schedule is known as the Federal supply 
schedule. Agencies can order commercial goods and services listed on 
this schedule in different quantities at the prices stated on the 
schedule.
  It provides a simplified process for agencies to acquire goods and 
services while also earning the volume discounts for the Federal 
Government as a whole.
  Current law is ambiguous about whether the contracts and orders under 
the Federal supply schedule program must be the lowest price or the 
best value price. Best value contracts consider price but also things 
like the quality of the product and the expertise of the service 
provider.
  The bill clarifies that both the lowest price and the best value are 
acceptable outcomes for contracts obtained under the scheduled program.
  I commend Representative Byron Donalds and Representative Gerry 
Connolly from Virginia for their work on the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on 
this bill, and I am prepared to close.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9596.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

                             General Leave

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5301, I urge support across 
the aisle, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5301, the Eliminate Useless 
Reports Act. I thank my distinguished colleague from California, the 
ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, 
Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs, Mr. 
Garcia for introducing H.R. 5301. I am proud to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California (Mr.  Robert 
Garcia) 2 minutes to discuss it.
  Mr. ROBERT GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
this commonsense bipartisan bill, the Eliminate Useless Reports Act, 
and I thank my co-lead, Representative Grothman from Wisconsin, for all 
his work and support.
  This bill is very simple. Congress, as we know, frequently requires 
that Federal agencies provide reports on various topics and issues. 
These reports provide Congress with important information, and we 
couldn't do our jobs without them.
  However, drafting these reports often takes lots of time and 
resources.
  Under this bill, every year, when agencies report their budget 
requests, they will also send a list of any congressional reports they 
believe that are outdated or duplicative. They can recommend that we 
sunset, modify, or consolidate these reports.
  We, in Congress, are unable to actually decide what is needed. When I 
was mayor of Long Beach, I worked to cut red tape so we could support 
small businesses and develop more housing where we needed it most. In 
Congress, this is a bipartisan way to pursue that same goal which is 
cutting the red tape.
  I thank the Senate leads on this bill, Senators Ossoff and Lankford. 
Finally, I will point out the bill has already passed the House once by 
voice vote. Now we just need to pass it again as the previous bill was 
adopted as a vehicle for separate legislation in the Senate.
  Today, I hope we pass this back to the Senate so it can again be 
agreed upon by unanimous consent and send it to the President's desk. I 
urge everyone to vote for this legislation.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, this bill would increase 
government efficiency and save taxpayer dollars by eliminating 
unnecessary reports.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Garcia and Grothman for their 
leadership on this issue and for the House Budget Committee's 
collaboration.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides to support the 
bill. I have no further speakers on this bill, and I am prepared to 
close.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5301, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE

  The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from 
the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

                                              Office of the Clerk,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to transmit herewith a 
     copy of a letter received from Ms. Christina Adkins, Director 
     of Elections, with the Texas Office of the Secretary of State 
     indicating that, according to the unofficial results for the 
     Special General Election held on November 5, 2024, the 
     Honorable Erica Lee Carter was elected Representative to 
     Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.
       With best wishes, I am
           Sincerely,
                                                Kevin F. McCumber,
     Acting Clerk.
                                  ____

                                               The State of Texas,


                              Jane Nelson, Secretary of State,

                                                 November 8, 2024.
     Hon. Kevin F. McCumber:
     Acting Clerk, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. McCumber: This is to advise you that the 
     unofficial results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, 
     November 5, 2024 for Representative in Congress from the 
     Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas, show that ERICA 
     LEE CARTER received 144,660 or 67.8% of the total number of 
     votes cast for that office.
       It would appear from these unofficial results that ERICA 
     LEE CARTER was elected as Representative in Congress from the 
     Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.
       To the best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there 
     is no contest to this election.
       As soon as the official results are certified to this 
     office by all counties involved and certified by the Governor 
     of Texas, an official Certificate of Election will be 
     prepared for transmittal as required by law.
           Sincerely,
                                                 Christina Adkins,
     Director of Elections.

               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

                                              Office of the Clerk,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to transmit herewith a 
     copy of a letter received from Ms. Meagan Wolfe, 
     Administrator, with the Wisconsin Elections Commission 
     indicating that, according to the unofficial results for the 
     Special General Election held on November 5, 2024, the 
     Honorable Tony Wied was elected Representative to Congress 
     for the Eighth Congressional District of Wisconsin.
       With best wishes, I am,
           Sincerely,
                                                Kevin F. McCumber,
                                                     Acting Clerk.
       Enclosure.
                                  ____



                               Wisconsin Elections Commission,

                                   Madison, WI, November 11, 2024.
     Hon. Kevin F. McCumber,
     Acting Clerk, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. McCumber: This is to advise you that the 
     unofficial results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, 
     November 5, 2024, for Representative in Congress from the 
     Eighth Congressional District of Wisconsin show that Tony 
     Wied received approximately 241,930 votes or 57.38% of the 
     total number of votes cast for that office, excluding write-
     in votes and scattering data for all locations which have not 
     yet been fully reported or canvassed by Wisconsin's election 
     officials. Democratic candidate, Kristin Lyerly, has received 
     approximately 179,862 votes or 42.62% of the total number of 
     votes cast for this office. The Commission's web page 
     provides a link to the real-time data posted by each county: 
     <a href='https://elections.wi.gov/
wisconsin-county-election-websites'>https://elections.wi.gov/
wisconsin-county-election-websites</a>.
       It would appear from these current, unofficial, and non-
     aggregate results that Tony Wied was elected as 
     Representative in Congress from the Eighth Congressional 
     District of Wisconsin. The latest date that the eleven 
     counties in the Eighth Congressional District of Wisconsin 
     may transmit their completed canvass is November 18, 2024, 
     although they may do so earlier. The Chairwoman of the 
     Wisconsin Elections Commission must conduct the canvass and 
     certification process at the state level once any recount 
     deadline has passed, and only then are the results official.
       To the best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there 
     is no contest to this election. Wisconsin Statutes would only 
     allow a recount for this race if the trailing candidate were 
     ``aggrieved,'' which in this race means the trailing 
     candidate must trail by no more than one percent of the total 
     votes cast. If a recount petition could be submitted, the 
     last possible date for submission would be November 21, 2024, 
     for this race, which is unlikely based on current, unofficial 
     reporting.
       As soon as the official results are certified to this 
     office by all county officials involved, an official 
     Certificate of Election will be prepared for transmittal as 
     required by law.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Meagan Wolfe,
                    Administrator, Wisconsin Elections Commission.

       WELCOMING THE HONORABLE ERICA LEE CARTER TO THE HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Doggett) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome to the House a new 
addition from Texas, Erica Lee Carter. This is a somewhat bittersweet 
moment for all of us because it was only a few months ago that we 
gathered here to commemorate the life and legacy of her mother, Sheila 
Jackson Lee. There is more than physical resemblance between the two.
  When I was elected in 1994 in the same small class of 13 that Sheila 
was a Member of, Erica was a teenager. She has been here a number of 
times over the three decades that Sheila served. Sheila was a fierce 
advocate for justice who fought relentlessly for her community. Erica, 
I know, has her mother's tenacity and her compassion.
  She carries on a legacy of helping those with the least. She has led 
initiatives on economic equality and voting rights in Harris County. 
She spearheaded a funding drive for after-school programs. She has also 
worked to end discriminatory practices in the workplace and uplift 
minority- and women-owned businesses.
  She is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
She earned a master's degree at Duke University's Terry Sanford School 
of Public Policy. She began her career as an elementary schoolteacher 
in Houston. Her expertise in the classroom and in making education more 
accessible for every child, regardless of ZIP Code, is a great example 
of why her strong voice will be valuable.
  While cancer cruelly cut Sheila's term short and Erica will be with 
us for a short time, I believe that we can count on her to continue 
carrying the torch for social justice in whatever role she may play, 
and we welcome her tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Lee Carter), 
our new colleague for her maiden speech.
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Doggett, my fellow 
colleagues in the Texas delegation, and Mr. Jeffries for welcoming me 
to the House.
  I, Congresswoman Erica Lee Carter, rise on behalf of the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas to return their voice and their vote to 
this esteemed body, the United States House of Representatives, to 
finish the 118th Congress with dignity, honor, and service.

  I thank God, the author and finisher of my faith, for this awesome 
privilege, which I do not take lightly.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my husband, Dr. Roy L. Carter, Jr., for his 
unwavering support and sense of humor that keeps me going. To my twin 
children, Roy Lee Carter, III, and Ellison Bennett Carter, I love you 
with all of my heart.
  To my father, Dr. Elwyn C. Lee, your unconditional love and guidance 
has continued to lift me.
  To my brother, Jason Lee, and cousin Whitney, thank you for being my 
biggest supporters.
  To the Jacksons, Lees, Carters, Cannons, and other extended family, 
thank you for being with me throughout this enormously challenging time 
and serving as a source of strength and support.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be the fifth person to serve the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, a line of service which began with the 
Honorable Barbara Jordan, who was the first Black woman from the South 
to be elected to Congress. She was followed by the Honorable Mickey 
Leland, a global humanitarian who brought attention to the suffering of 
many around the world, particularly on the continent of Africa.
  After Mickey came the Honorable Craig Washington, who was an astute 
jurist. Then came my mother, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, a 
prolific legislator who served as a bridge from the civil rights era 
till now, and a dedicated public servant who was committed to making 
America better for her children.
  I rise in the memory of my mother, the late, great Congresswoman 
Sheila Jackson Lee, who served this Chamber for nearly three decades. 
Her legacy of fierce advocacy, a voice for the voiceless, her 
unwavering commitment to speak truth to power shaped the lives of 
countless Americans. Her eloquence and mastery in the art of 
legislation brought forth reforms that echoed from Houston to the 
entire Nation.
  She was a social justice leader who advocated tirelessly for women, 
survivors of violence, and the wrongfully accused. As a senior member 
of the Judiciary Committee, she always fought to ensure that the United 
States Constitution was a living, breathing document that lived up to 
its promise for all people. She held it close and knew it could create 
a more perfect Union that we all desire.
  This is why she was proud to be the lead sponsor of the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act to recognize when freedom reached all 
America's shores. As an early member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, she worked to keep Americans safe at home and abroad and 
supported creating the Transportation Security Administration.
  She was known to work across the aisle through all Presidential 
administrations and congressional terms, doing what was necessary to 
make progress, bring resources back to Houston, and bend the moral arc 
of the universe toward justice.
  On behalf of my family, friends, and the 18th Congressional District, 
I offer my heartfelt thanks to her colleagues, now mine, who offered 
their support during her illness and beyond. Your kindness was a great 
comfort to her, and it reassured her that her work would endure.
  As for this moment tonight, while joyful, it is bittersweet because I 
wish she were standing at this podium to finish the 118th Congress on 
her own terms. Nevertheless, there is much work to do, and it is my 
honor to finish what she started alongside each of you.
  Mr. Speaker, I will stand for justice, freedom, economic opportunity, 
and the dignity for all Americans. I am so proud to serve all the 
people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas that starts near the 
bottoms of Third Ward, travels through Freedmen's Town where the newly 
emancipated slaves

[[Page H5947]]

settled and began to celebrate Juneteenth, steps into the Fifth Ward, 
the birthplace of Barbara and Mickey, travels toward the resilient 
Independence Heights, moves to North Forest then Humble, and then west 
toward Acres Homes.
  Mr. Speaker, I pledge every day to work hard for my constituents 
because every day they work hard to reach their American Dream. I am 
grateful for this moment in time to do this work and be a small part of 
my mother's tremendous legacy in this body. May God bless our work and 
may God bless the United States of America.

   WELCOMING THE HONORABLE TONY WIED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Grothman) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the newest member of the 
Wisconsin delegation, Tony Wied, on being sworn in this evening.
  Tony joins our delegation with an impressive three-decade career of 
starting, building, and running three retail outlets in northeast 
Wisconsin, including Dino Stop locations in Green Bay, Ledgeview, 
Manitowoc, New Franken, Little Suamico, and Abrams.
  Through his years in business, Tony has learned a lot about the value 
of hard work, strong customer service, and uniting people around a 
common mission.
  Tony has employed hundreds of Wisconsinites over the years and now 
brings that same commonsense business acumen to this body, where it is 
greatly needed. We need more people dealing with the common sense that 
requires you to be a small businessman, and he is going to help the 
everyday Americans pursue the American Dream.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to 
Tony; his wife, Angela; and his four sons: Charlie, Frank, George, and 
Simon on this momentous occasion.

  I certainly had a chance to see his four sons on the campaign trail. 
They are like a whirlwind across northeastern Wisconsin.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Wied).
  Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, the 
Republican Dean of the delegation, Congressman Glenn Grothman, for 
yielding.
  I will start by expressing my deepest gratitude to my wife of 24 
years, Angela, and also to my four boys and my mom and dad.
  Family is everything to me, and all of you have made this journey so 
much fun and special. I also thank my constituents for placing their 
trust in me. It is a privilege to serve you and an honor of a lifetime.
  Our country faces a lot of difficult challenges: record-high 
inflation, a border crisis, and increasing crime rates in our 
neighborhoods, to name only a few.
  Now is the time to bring some Wisconsin common sense to Washington to 
lower costs, secure our border, and rein in out-of-control government 
spending.
  I ran for Congress to solve America's toughest problems, and I pledge 
to work with my congressional colleagues to lower prices for northeast 
Wisconsin's middle-class families, small businesses, and farmers by 
putting more money back in their pockets.
  Mr. Speaker, I am excited to get to work.

                          ____________________

                              {time}  1930
     MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE HONORABLE DAVID HOBSON

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise, along with my dear colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, as dean of the Ohio delegation with a very 
grateful but heavy heart as we honor the memory of our distinguished 
former Ohio colleague, Congressman David Hobson, who passed away on 
October 6, 2024.
  David was a true patriot, dedicated to accomplishing innovative and 
tangible results and projects of merit. To all of his colleagues, he 
was a personal friend whose impact will be felt for generations. He 
embodied a joy of life. It was fun to know Dave, and he devoted his 
life to his family and serving the people of greater Springfield and 
Ohio.
  His 18-year tenure in Congress was marked by his enthusiasm, 
remarkable perseverance, and relentless commitment to achieve results. 
As he ascended to significant roles, including

[[Page H5949]]

as ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy 
and Water Development and Related Agencies and chair of the House 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, 
and Related Agencies, he distinguished himself with unwavering 
dedication to the defense and sustainment of our country.
  What set David apart was his precious ability to work across the 
aisle, and this is a legacy other Members could do well to learn from. 
He not only valued bipartisanship, but he thrived on it. His 
achievements from the shores of Normandy, France, to Springfield, 
Ohio's betterment are a testament to his profound tenacity, legacy of 
service, and leadership.
  His wit and humor brought light to our discussions, and his insights 
were invaluable.
  We all will sorely miss his visits, his laughter, and his unceasing 
efforts to improve the living conditions for his constituents and all 
of America.
  Today, all of us extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, 
Carolyn; his children, Susan, Lynn, and Doug; and his family, 
constituents, and friends.
  As we remember Congressman Hobson today, let us carry forward his 
exemplary spirit of service and dedication, and may his soul rest in 
eternal peace. May his legacy inspire us all.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues if they could please join us in a 
moment of silence in recognition of his good life.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kaptur for calling to 
the attention of our colleagues the distinguished service of David 
Hobson.
  When she said he worked across the aisle, that is exactly what he 
did, with respect for the dignity and the views of all of us in this 
body.
  I had the privilege of traveling with him to theaters of war, with 
him and Jack Murtha, his pal. I have had the joy of enjoying the candy 
that he would bring from Ohio, saying it was the best chocolate candy 
ever.
  I also had deep gratitude to him for what he did to help us with the 
Presidio in San Francisco, for our appropriations funding, again 
reaching across the aisle.
  This was a very special person, a person full of joy but very serious 
about the legislation and very committed to bipartisanship in the body. 
It was an honor to serve with him. I join in extending condolences to 
his family.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank his family for sharing him with us. David Hobson 
was a blessing to our country.

                    GAO INSPECTOR GENERAL PARITY ACT

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules

of the Inspector General of the Government Accountability Office, and 
for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                                S. 1510

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``GAO Inspector General Parity 
     Act''.

     SEC. 2. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE GOVERNMENT 
                   ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE.

       Section 705 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--
       (1) in subsection (b)--
       (A) in paragraph (2)--
       (i) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The Inspector General'';
       (ii) in subparagraph (A), as so designated, by striking the 
     second sentence; and
       (iii) by adding at the end the following:
       ``(B) If the Inspector General is removed from office or is 
     transferred to another position or location within the

     shall communicate in writing the substantive rationale, 
     including detailed and case-specific reasons, for any such 
     removal or transfer to both Houses of Congress (including to 
     the appropriate congressional committees), not later than 30 
     days before the removal or transfer.
       ``(C) If there is an open or completed inquiry into the

     communication required under subparagraph (B) shall--

     conducted, the inquiry; and
       ``(ii) in the case of a completed inquiry, contain the 
     findings made during the inquiry.
       ``(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a personnel 
     action otherwise authorized by law, other than transfer or 
     removal.'';
       (B) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and
       (C) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:
       ``(3)(A) Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, 
     only the Comptroller General may place the Inspector General

     detailed and case-specific reasons, for the change in status 
     to both Houses of Congress (including to the appropriate 
     congressional committees) not later than 15 days before the 
     date on which the change in status takes effect, except that 
     the Comptroller General may submit that communication not

     the continued presence of the Inspector General in the 
     workplace poses a specific threat; and

     Accountability Office, obtain legal advice from a counsel 
     reporting directly to the Inspector General or another 
     Inspector General.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.


                             General Leave

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Louisiana?

[[Page H5950]]

  There was no objection.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1510, the GAO Inspector General 
Parity Act.
  Two years ago, Congress passed sweeping bipartisan reforms for the 
inspector general community. Those reforms, passed in the fiscal year 
2023 NDAA, provided critical reforms to enable both the independence of 
Federal agency inspectors general and proper congressional oversight 
over their activities.
  As a legislative branch entity, the Government Accountability 
Office's inspector general was not included in those reforms. H.R. 5300 
fixes that by providing the GAO inspector general the same resources 
and oversight now provided to other IGs across the government.
  Those reforms include requiring the head of GAO to notify the 
Congress if the GAO inspector general is to be removed or transferred, 
providing Congress the knowledge it needs to weigh in on such decisions 
if necessary.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1510, the GAO Inspector 
General Parity Act. I commend both Senator Michael Braun for 
introducing the bill and also my colleagues, Representatives Robert 
Garcia and Lisa McClain, for introducing the House companion.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Robert Garcia) to explain the bill.

                              {time}  1945

  Mr. ROBERT GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge 
the House to pass the bipartisan Government Accountability Office 
Inspector General Parity Act.
  The GAO, of course, is an independent, nonpartisan agency responsible 
for monitoring government operations to detect waste, fraud, and abuse.
  Like other Federal agencies, the GAO has an inspector general 
watching over their operations, conducting audits, improving 
efficiency, and ensuring the agency follows the law.
  Congress has in the past several years made important reforms to 
strengthen the inspectors general systems for all of our agencies, to 
guarantee their independence, and to make sure they have the resources 
and the tools that they need.
  Those reforms regrettably did not apply to the GAO. Our bill is a 
simple and bipartisan fix to correct these oversights.
  Among other reforms, we are going to ensure the GAO has the 
independent general counsel they need to communicate budget requests 
directly to Congress without any sort of interference.
  The bill did pass the Senate unanimously, thanks to the Senate 
sponsors, Senator and now Governor-elect Mike Braun and Homeland 
Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters.
  In the House, I am grateful for the support of Chairman Comer, 
Ranking Member Raskin, and my House co-lead, Representative Lisa 
McClain of Michigan.
  This bill passed unanimously by voice vote from the Oversight 
Committee, and I urge adoption of this long overdue bill to send to the 
President's desk and urge it to become law.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on 
this bill, and I am prepared to close.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has the only time remaining.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House 
colleagues to support this commonsense bill to support the GAO 
Inspector General in carrying out their oversight mission.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 1510.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2274. Dessie Bebout was a

                    GAVIN NEWSOM'S POLITICAL THEATER

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, once again, California Governor Gavin 
Newsom is prioritizing political theater over solving California's real 
issues.
  While he is busy here in Washington touting his so-called Trump-
proofing efforts, Californians are struggling under the weight of his 
failed policies.
  He claims his latest moves on guns, climate, housing, and healthcare 
are about protecting Californians, but let's get real. Newsom's high-
cost rail project, the high-speed train, is costing four times what it 
originally was projected. It is over budget and many years behind 
schedule. He is pushing for more taxpayer funding for that.
  The California Air Resources Board, known as CARB, is coming down 
with even more rules that are driving the cost of fuel.
  California is already about $1 per gallon higher than the rest of the 
country, maybe even $1.50. They just added rules the other day that 
will raise it anywhere from 47 cents to 65 cents per gallon or even 
more because of some climate change rule.
  Are they tone-deaf to what just happened?
  Not to electioneer here, but the people of this country spoke loudly 
that they are tired of unnecessary pain being inflicted upon them by 
governments. The State of California is stepping up to do that even 
more so, and they want the Federal Government to help them with EPA and 
more waivers to do this kind of stuff that will hurt families and hurt 
industry.

          RECOGNIZING BROOKE COTTRELL FROM CORRYTON, TENNESSEE

  (Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I recognize Brooke Cottrell from Corryton, 
Tennessee, who recently graduated from Lincoln Memorial University as a 
physician assistant. She is the daughter of my good friend, Scott 
Moore.
  Brooke has always been a very good student. She graduated from Gibbs 
High School as their valedictorian in 2015 and attended East Tennessee 
State University where she graduated in 2018 before heading to LMU.
  She was inspired to become a physician assistant because tragically 
she lost her Meemaw and Papi to COVID. She said: ``God called me to 
take care of people during some of the most vulnerable and scary 
moments in people's lives. I want to use my medical training and faith 
in God to provide healing and comfort.''
  Along with her academic achievements, Brooke has a heart to help 
those in need. She has spent a lot of her time working with local 
community organizations to help folks who are less fortunate, and she 
wants to use her career to continue taking care of east Tennesseans who 
need it most.
  Brooke is a true Tennessean, so, of course, she loves the country 
life, farming, and UT football. She enjoys the opportunity to take in 
the natural beauty of east Tennessee while hiking and spending time 
with her dogs, Enzo and Biscuit.
  I congratulate Brooke on her recent graduation.
  I am looking forward to seeing Brooke's bright future that she has 
ahead of her.
  I drove by their house, Mr. Speaker, on the day of her celebration. 
My daughter asked me what was going on. I said: Honey, I don't know, 
but, obviously, we weren't invited.
  Oddly enough, when I got home I found the invitation, so I missed the 
party.

           LA PURISIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH'S 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 100th 
anniversary of La Purisima Catholic Church, that is 100 years of 
service to our community in the city of Orange.
  Established in 1924, the church originally served local residents and 
seasonal migrant farm workers from Mexico. As the city of Orange grew, 
so did La Purisima. It adapted to meet the needs of its new 
parishioners, leading to some of the first trilingual services in the 
Diocese of Orange County.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing La 
Purisima Catholic Church as it celebrates 100 years of great service. 
We look forward to the next 100 years.
  Congratulations for service well done.

                  HONORING THE LIFE OF DARIEL VASQUEZ

  (Mr. LAWLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dariel 
Vasquez, a courageous young man from Pomona, New York, who tragically 
lost his life at just 18 years old.
  Dariel was a dedicated parks and recreation aide with the New York 
State Parks Department and a selfless volunteer with the wildland fire 
crew, who gave his life battling a wildfire in Sterling Forest in 
Greenwood Lake.
  A 2024 graduate and captain of the Ramapo High School varsity 
baseball team, Dariel was a true leader, beloved by his teammates, 
coworkers, and friends alike.
  His coach described him as authentic, a young man who inspired 
everyone around him with his kindness, strength, and unwavering 
dedication.
  Dariel was a star player and a beloved son, brother, and friend. He 
had big dreams, plans for college, and hopes for the future, all left 
tragically unfulfilled.
  At his vigil, family, friends, and community members gathered to 
remember a young man who embodied the spirit of service and who bravely 
gave his life to protect our Hudson Valley community.
  May Dariel Vasquez rest in peace.

                        UNITED METHODIST CHURCH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by stating some very related 
facts.
  First and foremost, I am a proud United Methodist. In fact, I am an 
ordained United Methodist elder. I served one church for 38 years as 
pastor. The church, St. James United Methodist Church, is located in 
Kansas City, Missouri. I followed the Reverend Phillip J. Lawson as the 
pastor.
  Phil Lawson was a very prominent social activist in Kansas City. In 
terms of his activism, he followed his big brother, the inimitable 
James Lawson. James Lawson was the civil rights iconic pastor of the 
Centenary United Methodist Church in Memphis, Tennessee.
  It was Jim Lawson who, upon returning from India spending 3 years 
working under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi, met Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and began to talk about this theory of nonviolence.

[[Page H5953]]

  Dr. King invited him to move to the South and work with this 
fledgling organization called the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference.
  Jim Lawson also remained in Memphis where he began to tutor 
individuals who were going to participate in the freedom rides.
  Jim Lawson was a major human being, and he is someone who helped give 
me the guidance I needed as a young person becoming involved in not 
only the United Methodist Church but the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference. Jim Lawson was so prophetic to all of the young people, 
including our own John Lewis, who served here with us for many years, 
for several decades.
  It was a pleasure of mine when I left the mayor's office in Kansas 
City to be given a radio program that was broadcast live in Kansas City 
from Union Station.
  I brought in various guests. My first guest was the Reverend James 
Lawson. I talked about things that I thought people wanted to know. He 
is the pastor who invited Martin Luther King to Memphis when Dr. King 
was killed. He is also the first layperson to go in and meet with James 
Earl Ray. He is the person who after the assassination of Dr. King 
created all of the national attention not only on the assassination but 
on the movement.
  James Lawson died a few months ago at the age of 95. We thank God for 
giving him those years.
  When I decided to run for Congress, Jim Lawson said: I hope that you 
will call and see if there is some kind of way that you can stay in the 
United Methodist Building.
  Of course, my first question was: What is the United Methodist 
Building?
  At that time I did not have a full knowledge about the United 
Methodist Building here in Washington, D.C.
  Decades ago, there was a man with tremendous vision in the early 
1900s, the Reverend Clarence True Wilson who had this vision of a 
building right across the street from the United States Capitol. This 
building was initially supposed to be the headquarters of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church's efforts to pass the laws relating to Prohibition. I 
guess I should say first that it didn't work. However, I don't think we 
Methodists should be upset because the prohibition God gave Adam and 
Eve didn't work either.
  I do think, however, that the building of that building located right 
across the street from us here has been not only a place for United 
Methodist witness but a place where people from all over the world have 
been able to come and hold meetings. It has also been a place where 
people who were demonstrating could find a place where they could get a 
cool sip of water. It was a place where people in emergencies could 
come in. It was a place of refuge. Frankly, it still is a place of 
refuge.
  I think a part of the definition of what that Methodist building 
became was a result of the March on Washington in 1968. People came to 
the March on Washington, mainly Methodists, gathered around the 
Methodist building and in the Methodist building.
  It was a place where Native Americans were able to gather later for 
demonstrations and where they could come and discuss the major issues.
  I was fortunate enough to bump into Jim Winkler who responded to my 
inquiry about living in the Methodist building. I am proud and pleased 
to say that was 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, I came to Washington 
and moved into the United Methodist Building at 110 Maryland Avenue, 
NE, right across the street from this Capitol.
  I will have to say that many of my early mornings were started before 
I wanted to start my early morning because it is also right across the 
street from the United States Supreme Court, and the protesters will 
quite often ignore my sleeping pattern and will begin to protest in the 
wee hours of the morning. I would say 6 o'clock is wee hours of the 
morning for me.
  I think that people have come now, and here we are all these years 
later, over 100 years. Now, after 100 years, the Methodist building 
stands as a monument not only to a denomination but for a large piece 
of the United States population. That is the population of people who 
believe that we all have the right to worship as we please. It is a 
part of the legislative and founding articles of the United States.
  People will be able to come by the Methodist building. Some people 
say that we sometimes have controversial messages out in front of the 
building, and I like to tell them that if you stay around long enough 
and walk by here long enough, you will finally see something that you 
like. There will be some kind of sign there that you can embrace.
  All of those messages that are placed there are messages that we 
believe help to create the kind of government that all of us in reality 
would like to have, which is a free and just system of government and 
the right to worship as we choose.
  We are not keeping that building open for the purpose of 
proselytizing and trying to convert people to the United Methodist 
Church.

                              {time}  2015

  It stands, therefore, as the United Methodist Building, but it is 
open to every single person who desires to come into those doors.
  There are coalitions. For example, Jim Winkler, who I spoke of 
earlier, chaired a coalition opposing the Iraq war during President 
George W. Bush's administration. There were people who, at the same 
time, understood that George W. Bush was the son of a person who had 
been a part of another denomination, but the President at that time, 
President Bush, was a United Methodist. One of the places that was 
considered for his daughter's wedding was the United Methodist 
Building, performed by the Reverend Kirbyjon Caldwell, the United 
Methodist pastor of Houston, Texas.
  In the United Methodist Building, there are, of course, apartments, 
and there are offices of many different denominations. In fact, in that 
building, one can find just about any denomination actively involved in 
the affairs of this country officing in that building.
  During the whole process of the Affordable Care Act, which brought 
tens of thousands of people from around the country to Washington, 
D.C., that place did two things. One, it was a place where this 
coalition that had formed around the Affordable Care Act could come and 
meet, but it was also a place where those many people stopped when they 
needed water or needed some other emergency service. I was here. I saw 
it. I witnessed it. I was inconvenienced by it because I couldn't get 
to my apartment for several days.
  We look at the United Methodist Church as just a religious 
organization, but the United Methodist Building, which is representing 
the United Methodist Church, is much more than just a religious 
organization.
  I also have to say that it is not a perfect location, but it is about 
as good as you can get. We don't have any parking. There is no parking 
there.
  I have to tell a story that may be true. The Senate was trying to 
decide whether to build another office building. It was decided that 
the best location was on the lot that we now know as the 110 Maryland 
site. The United States Government, of course, through eminent domain, 
can take property and give a fair amount for that property.
  As the story goes, the Methodist bishop for this area knew about this 
plan from a Member of the United States Senate, and this Senator, 
giving the bishop that information, told the bishop he wished that 
there was something he could do to prevent this from happening, but it 
was going to happen.
  This bishop began to think: What can we do? He got a list of all the 
members of the United Methodist Church who were Members of the United 
States Senate. He sent them all a letter inviting them to come over to 
the building. When they came to the building, he said: Look, we have 
been thinking about converting some of these offices into apartments, 
and we just wanted to make sure that the Members of the Senate who were 
a part of the United Methodist Church would have the first opportunity 
to get an apartment.
  Needless to say, the eminent domain faded and faded away. From that 
point on, as the story goes, those apartments have been there. When I 
first moved into the United Methodist Building, my next-door neighbor 
was Al Gore's mom, who was a Baptist. I lived there for about a year 
during the time that she was there, and then she passed.
  The reality was I knew Al Gore through politics, so I could always 
tell

[[Page H5954]]

when I was very secure in the United Methodist Church. Those were the 
days that Al Gore visited his mom, coming into the church with Secret 
Service. I told my wife and family back in Kansas City that those were 
the safest moments of my life, when there were 12 or 13 Secret Service 
agents running in.
  I also am very proud that when they came to clean up her apartment 
after she had passed, she forgot one thing. I walked in there during 
the last few hours of the cleaning, and there was a yard placard which 
read ``Al Gore for President.'' I have that in my apartment right now. 
I kept that as a point of remembering not only Mrs. Gore but also my 
friendship with the Vice President, Al Gore, also a former Member of 
the United States House.
  Let me just say in conclusion that, on January 6, I was here in 
Washington. In my office, I had no idea of what was going on. When we 
turned on the annunciator and found out what was going on here at the 
Capitol, my great fear was that I would not be able to go home.
  Then, of course, about 3 a.m. in the morning, after we took care of 
business in here by confirming the electoral college's report, I walked 
out of the building and began to walk to the fence and go to my 
apartment.
  I was met by several police officers who said they had to accompany 
me. The police were from the Capitol Police force. Also, most people 
don't realize this, but there is a Supreme Court Police force. I 
mention that because I tell people that the United Methodist Building 
is one of the safest places. There are actually three police 
departments taking care of the whole area. The Capitol Police, the 
Supreme Court Police, and then the Metropolitan Police are all taking 
care of this area.
  It is safe for anybody and everybody to visit the United Methodist 
Building. If you see that there are activities over there that you 
would like to participate in, feel free to contact the United Methodist 
Building. The building was there for one purpose. Since that purpose is 
no longer an issue in the United States, it serves many other purposes, 
one of them being a place of refuge.
  I have performed three weddings in the building. I baptized two 
people, including one Member. The Methodist Building is a point of joy 
not only for me but for a number of people here.
  I baptized the children of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's chief of 
staff and felt really good about performing weddings there because I 
have a 100 percent record there. Everybody who I married in the United 
Methodist Building is still married. That is a hint to those of you who 
are watching this. Get married in the United Methodist Building.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                   Recognition of the Majority Leader

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.


                         2024 Election Results

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 1 week ago, a near-record number of 
Americans carried on the grand tradition of voting in a national 
election and of passing the torch peacefully.
  There are many things we can say about what happened last Tuesday. It 
was not the result many of us wanted. But we live in a democracy where 
the will of the people is respected and followed, and the American 
people have spoken.
  I congratulate President-elect Trump on his victory, and I look 
forward to speaking with him soon.
  I congratulate Vice President Harris and Governor Walz for running a 
historic campaign. They can be proud of the incredible work their team 
has done over the last 4 months. The values Vice President Harris ran 
on will live on--individual freedom, opportunity for all, and working 
together to build a safer, stronger nation.
  For those of us who have been given the honor of representing the 
people of our States, we look forward to serving, to governing, to 
working in a principled and bipartisan fashion, to reward the trust the 
American people have placed in us.
  Now, to my fellow Democrats across America, it is natural and 
appropriate to feel deep disappointment, grief, and even anger in this 
moment. I understand those feelings. It never feels good to come up 
short. But when you do, you get up, you dust yourself off, you learn, 
and you prepare to do better in the future. You study what occurred. We 
will do that. You listen to what voters are saying, and you find ways 
to make government responsive to those wants and desires, those dreams, 
those needs.
  And you also take the approval of the voters from places we each 
represent--those voters who sent us back to the Senate--and carry forth 
the principles we campaigned on and we won on, and you find ways to put 
those principles into practice as much as possible, while finding ways 
to work in a bipartisan fashion to get things done.
  As I have told my caucus this week, we should regard this election 
not merely as a defeat but, more importantly, as a challenge. The 
American people have presented us with a challenge, and we must answer 
the call. We have to look at what we did right, what we did wrong, and 
what we didn't do but should have done.
  First, we have to look at what we did right and continue to pursue 
those goals. Many of our Senate colleagues, after all, are returning to 
the Senate

[[Page S6500]]

despite facing strong headwinds. I will say more about that in a 
moment.
  Second, we have to understand the things we did wrong and how we must 
change.
  And, third, we have to look at what we didn't do but should have 
done.
  We will have these important and necessary conversations in due 
course, and everyone must have a seat at the table. We must be honest. 
We must be practical. And we must never abandon the roots that have 
defined the Democratic Party for generations.
  To Democrats who were back around in 2004, remember the grief we felt 
back then? It was a tough election, for sure. But what happened 
afterward? We got back to work to regain the trust of the American 
people. I was proud to be part of that process as chair of the DSCC. 
And just 2 years later, the tide turned in a dramatic way.
  Finally, before I turn to the Senate, let me say this: I hope that, 
after last week, we can put to rest the fantasy of stolen elections and 
rigged outcomes.
  Four years ago, the losing side refused to accept the will of the 
people, and it led to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. This 
year, we will not go down that dark and violent path.
  Now, let me go on to the Senate. Last Tuesday brought a mix of 
success and disappointment for Senate Democrats. In the final analysis, 
we hoped for a better result. As happens from time to time, control of 
this Chamber will change from one party to the other.
  To Senator Brown and Senator Tester, we could not be prouder of the 
races you ran. More importantly, we could not be prouder of the legacy 
you have built here in the U.S. Senate. You are some of the finest 
people I have ever worked with in this Chamber. To both of you, I say: 
Thank you. Job well done. Job well done.
  I have spoken to both Senators Tester and Brown a couple of times 
this past week. They are not ones to get down on themselves. They are 
going to be just fine, and they will continue to do great things for 
their home States and for our country. But I feel for the people of 
Montana and Ohio, who will now lose two incredible leaders.
  To Senators Rosen and Baldwin, we are thrilled that you are coming 
back for another term, despite all the headwinds and obstacles you 
faced back home.
  In fact, despite a difficult year for Democrats, four of our most 
contested seats will remain in the hands of Democrats. In one other 
State, the votes are still being counted.
  Let me repeat that. Despite a difficult year for Democrats, which 
everyone predicted would be a place where we lost all of our seats, 
almost--despite that--four of the most contested seats will remain in 
Democratic hands: Nevada, Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin.
  As I said, in one more State, the votes are still being counted.
  Donald Trump won all of those States, but so did all our Democratic 
colleagues and colleagues to be.
  Winning four Senate seats from the Nation's tightest swing States 
does not happen on its own. It is a testament to the incredible work 
Senate Democrats have done in this Chamber to benefit the American 
people.
  With Democrats in the majority, the United States had its most 
successful and productive years in decades. Under our watch, this 
Chamber became a place where we got things done--amazing things done.
  We passed bold legislation that lifted America out of crisis, rebuilt 
our economy, and invested in good-paying jobs. We passed the American 
Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the Chips and Science 
Act. We took care of our veterans. We defended Ukraine. We protected 
marriage equality. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which has 
done more to improve the environment than any other act and also 
lowered the cost of prescription drugs. And we did so much more. These 
accomplishments will continue to pay off for years and decades to come.
  I am proud that the vast majority of our accomplishments were done in 
a bipartisan fashion. As a result, many of our incumbents are coming 
back, despite a tough year, and multiple swing seats will remain with 
Democrats.
  Now, to my newly elected Democratic colleagues from across the 
country, I extend a welcoming hand. I met with these new Members just 
now in my office. We are excited to get to work. We are excited you are 
joining our caucus.
  Now, let me turn to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
Another closely contested election now comes to an end. To my 
Republican colleagues, I offer a word of caution in good faith. Take 
care not to misread the will of the people, and do not abandon the need 
for bipartisanship.
  After winning an election, the temptation may be to go to the 
extreme. We have seen that happen over the decades, and it has 
consistently backfired on the party in power. So instead of going to 
the extremes, I remind my colleagues that this body is most effective 
when it is bipartisan.
  If we want, in the next 4 years, the Senate to be as productive as 
the last 4, the only way that will happen is through bipartisan 
cooperation.
  Democrats will be ready to do what we have consistently done: work 
with both sides when the opportunity arises. Democrats will never 
abandon our values, but neither will we reject an opportunity to move 
the ball forward to make people's lives better when we can. The 
question is, now, whether or not Republicans are willing to do the 
same.
  To my colleagues on the other side, once again, do not abandon 
bipartisanship. It is the best and most effective way to get things 
done. It was true in the last 4 years, and it will be true in the years 
to come.
  Finally, let me end with this. For millions of Americans, 
particularly those on this side of the aisle, this is a difficult 
moment. But as John F. Kennedy once said, ``Let us not despair but 
act.''
  Let us not despair but act. Let us not give up on the dream that is 
America. Instead, let us do what those who came before us have always 
done. Let us persevere. Let us persist. Let us get to work.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

is recognized.

MINORITY LEADER The Republican leader is recognized.


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


                         2024 Election Results

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a week ago today, the American people 
stood to be counted. They lined up to make their voices heard, and the 
message they sent was resoundingly clear.
  Four years ago, they watched Washington Democrats take an economy 
that was primed for recovery and douse it in reckless taxing and 
inflationary spending. Over 4 years, they watched consumer prices rise 
more than 20 percent. As they made tough choices at the grocery store 
and felt the pain at the gas pump, they watched Washington Democrats 
deflect blame for the worst inflation in four decades. And last 
Tuesday, they said enough was enough.
  And 4 years ago, they watched Washington Democrats campaign on 
slashing ICE and halting construction of physical barriers along the 
southern border. Month by month, they watched as this unseriousness and 
willful neglect turned into the worst humanitarian and security crisis 
at the border on record. And last Tuesday, they said enough was enough.
  Also 4 years ago, they watched Washington Democrats campaign on 
defunding the police and going soft on crime. In cities across America, 
their fears of unchecked violent crime were proven justified. And last 
Tuesday, they said enough was enough.
  Last week, American voters were desperate for leaders who could 
deliver safe streets, secure borders, stable prices, and strength 
abroad. So they chose to hire Republicans. They maintained a Republican 
majority in the House; they created a decisive Republican majority in 
the Senate; and by a wide margin, they put the White House in 
Republican hands once again.
  The Nation surveyed its problems and decided that Republicans were 
equipped to put the ship of state back on the right track. Thus far, I 
have been encouraged by the lack of baseless

[[Page S6501]]

speculation that Tuesday's decisive result was influenced in any way by 
foreign interference. Washington Democrats appear to recognize that 
they are on the losing side of a legitimate, crystal-clear mandate.
  Here in the Senate, I hope they will work with the new Senate 
Republican majority as we begin to clean up the messes left over from 
the past 4 years. The first opportunities to work together are already 
upon us. The Senate has a great deal of outstanding business that we 
have to tackle in the coming weeks. We certainly need to pass the long 
overdue National Defense Authorization Act. Every year, the NDAA gives 
Congress an indispensable opportunity to set national security 
priorities. This year, it is a chance to show we appreciate the gravity 
of an especially dangerous moment. After months of needless dithering, 
I would urge the Democratic leader to get this must-pass legislation 
moving without further delay.
  We also need to work swiftly to deliver urgent supplemental 
assistance to the States and communities hit hard by natural disasters 
in recent months. Kentucky knows the power and pain of severe storms 
and flooding. This year, communities across the southeast recovering 
from major hurricane and flood damage deserve the Senate's attention 
and support.
  And before anyone gets home for the holidays, we will need to extend 
Federal government funding. As I have said before, there is never a 
political advantage to be gained from allowing core government 
functions to go dark. The 119th Congress and the 47th President must 
not inherit a Federal Government in the middle of a funding crisis. The 
work ahead of us will require all parties to operate quickly and in 
good faith. The American people deserve nothing less.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

                          Reproductive Rights

  Mr. President, 2 years ago, six rightwing judicial activists sent us 
back in time. And I am referring, of course, to the Supreme Court 
decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. I guess it 
was a crowning achievement for the Republican-led, decades-long 
campaign to overrule Roe v. Wade and eliminate fundamental reproductive 
rights in America.
  The Dobbs ruling has turned out to be one of the most dangerous 
decisions ever handed down by the Supreme Court. It overruled nearly 50 
years of court decisions and, for the first time, stripped away a 
constitutional right from Americans. Overruling Roe v. Wade has 
unleashed a healthcare crisis unimaginable. Following the decision, 
nearly two dozen States have either banned or restricted access to 
abortion or are in the process of doing so. Many of these bans provide 
no exceptions for victims of rape and incest, and many utterly fail to 
protect the health and lives of mothers. Some of these bans are written 
in a way that can limit access even to contraception.
  During my time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we have held 
multiple hearings on the impact of the Dobbs decision and the need to 
safeguard reproductive rights. I share the concerns of many Americans 
about what a second Trump administration could mean for women's 
reproductive rights and healthcare.
  The majority of Americans support a woman's right to choose, and 
whatever further turmoil President-elect Trump may unleash on access to 
reproductive health care, we will not stop fighting for our Nation's 
women and families.

                       Senate Judiciary Committee

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am honored to serve as chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, where the committee members work hard to 
protect freedom, advance justice, protect equality, and bring balance 
to our Federal authorities.
  Over the past 4 years, we have advanced well-qualified nominees to 
the Federal bench who reflect the reality of America. We have made 
significant progress on issues important to our Nation. For many of us, 
the outcome of last week's election was not what we wanted, what we 
fought for, or what we voted for. But my priorities for the committee 
have not changed because of the election. I will continue to work on 
issues that are important to all Americans: judicial confirmations, 
reproductive rights for women, fixing our broken immigration system, 
and gun violence protection.
  I am especially proud of the committee's contributions to one of the 
most important accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration: 
confirming highly qualified, independent, evenhanded judges to the 
Federal bench. During the Biden administration, the Senate has 
confirmed 213 well-qualified judges to lifetime appointments on the 
Federal bench. One-fourth of all the Federal judgeships have been 
filled in the last 4 years, and counting.
  Aside from their exceptional qualifications and respect for the rule 
of law, these judges represent historic demographic and professional 
diversity. Under President Biden's leadership, the Senate has confirmed 
more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than all Presidents 
combined, including--and I am proud to say this--the first ever Black 
woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. She 
is exceptional.
  We have confirmed a historic number of Asian-American, Latino, and 
LGBTQ+ judges. We have also confirmed more circuit judges with 
experience as public defenders than all other Presidents combined.
  The American people deserve a Federal judiciary which looks like 
America and reflects our reality. Until the end of my tenure as chair, 
I will continue to urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of 
these well-qualified and diverse judicial nominees.

                              Immigration

  Mr. President, on another issue, our Nation needs immigrants now more 
than ever. They are a vital part of the American history and the 
American success story of the future.
  I am deeply concerned that the incoming President has campaigned on 
deporting children and families who have lived in this country for 
years. Mr. President, you have met these people. I have, too. We count 
on them every day in so many different ways. When we look at what the 
incoming President has proposed, I worry about what is going to happen 
when these children and their families are deported from this country. 
It could be devastating to our economy.
  If the DACA Program alone is struck down, experts predict our economy 
will lose $11 billion-plus yearly in lost wages. Without continued 
immigration, the U.S. working-age population will shrink by 6 million 
by the year 2040. As Americans retire, this could lead to a 23-percent 
reduction in money being paid into the Social Security fund for our 
retirees.
  If we genuinely want to boost the American economy and resolve labor 
shortages, we need to provide a path to citizenship for those who have 
long contributed to our economy and society.
  I have worked for years to pass bipartisan legislation to fix our 
broken immigration system. Such legislation is needed to secure the 
border and protect American workers from outsourcing companies that 
exploit temporary workers. We need immigration reform to protect the 
children of temporary workers who age out of legal status when they 
turn 21, as well as Dreamers, recipients of TPS, farmworkers, and other 
essential workers.
  There are Members of this U.S. Senate and the House of 
Representatives who sincerely, positively believe that we should not 
let one more immigrant into this country. That is an unrealistic and a 
mean-spirited approach to the challenge we face.
  I believe we all agree--I certainly do--that we need to make certain 
that everyone coming into this country has the potential of making this 
a better nation. We should not be opening our doors to anyone who is 
dangerous to America, period. We can say that on a bipartisan basis, I 
am sure.
  Secondly, we cannot absorb every person in the world who has the 
ambition to live in this country. We have to have an orderly system.
  But let's be honest about who these people are. Somewhere across 
America--maybe in the city of Chicago--parents dropped off their kids 
at daycare

[[Page S6502]]

today. It is an undocumented worker who is taking care of your little 
granddaughter or daughter at that daycare facility. They are also the 
people who are taking care of your mothers and grandmothers in nursing 
homes. They made sure that Mom got down to breakfast this morning and 
didn't slip and fall in the hallway. They stood next to her. Do you 
want to deport that woman who helped her to breakfast this morning? I 
don't. If she is not breaking the law and she is a positive part of 
America's economy, let's make her part of our future and find a way to 
do it.
  We had a comprehensive immigration bill not that long ago that passed 
with an overwhelming majority here in the U.S. Senate. There was a 
process there which I was part of writing that makes a difference in 
the way we approach immigration. We should be doing something positive 
on a bipartisan basis to deal with this issue and not be swearing at 
the people who are talking about change as being somehow un-American.
  Fighting for our Nation's immigrants in the right way will continue 
to be one of my highest priorities.

                              Gun Violence

  Finally, tomorrow, the committee will hold a hearing on conversion 
devices used to increase the lethality of firearms, such as Glock 
switches, auto sears, bump stocks, and pistol braces. Some of these 
devices can be used to convert a semiautomatic firearm, designed to 
fire one shot per trigger pull, into a fully automatic firearm. This 
makes it easier for a gunman to commit mass murders, such as the 
deadliest mass shooting in modern history when a shooter killed 60 
people and wounded hundreds more in Las Vegas in 2017. These modified 
machine guns are weapons of war, and we need to get them off the 
streets of America and away from innocent American families.
  While my time as chair of this committee will end in January, my 
belief in the promise of this country never will end. I promise to work 
each day in the Senate to look out for the most vulnerable among us, to 
ensure liberty and equality for every person, and to uphold the rule of

                              Veterans Day

  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, yesterday, we celebrated Veterans Day. 
On this day, we honor the brave men and women who have valiantly served 
and sacrificed to protect us and secure our liberties, both in times of 
war and in times of peace.
  We are especially thankful to those veterans who were permanently 
injured as a result of their service. They sacrificed their safety to 
protect America. We are deeply grateful to these veterans.
  It is difficult for words alone to express how appreciative we are of 
America's veterans and their families.
  To the Gold Star families, your service to our country does not go 
unnoticed. America will never forget the sacrifices your families have 
made in service to this great Nation. I want to acknowledge your 
dedication to honoring the memory of your fallen family members, who 
paid the ultimate price.
  We are forever indebted to those who have worn the uniform in the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and Space Force. I hope 
all Americans can commit to serving our veterans with the same amount 
of devotion they had when fighting for our great Nation.
  This national holiday began 105 years ago when President Woodrow 
Wilson declared November 11 as ``Armistice Day.'' This marked the 1-
year anniversary of the conclusion of World War I. In 1947, a World War 
II veteran named Raymond Weeks, of Birmingham, AL--my State--led a 
movement asking the Army Chief of Staff, then a general named Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, to expand Armistice Day to include all veterans, not just 
the ones from World War I. Seven years later, after becoming President, 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed national Veterans Day into law, 
reflecting the wishes of that great Alabamian named Raymond Weeks. 
Alabama is proud of Mr. Weeks for that great donation.
  Alabama is also proud to be home to 400,000 veterans. We are thankful 
for these brave Alabamians and the more than 19 million U.S. veterans 
living across the world.
  We thank you for your dedication, the sacrifices you made, and the 
courage you displayed to ensure that America remains, as Abraham 
Lincoln said, the last, best hope on Earth.
  Today, I will recognize three Alabama veterans who honorably served 
in our Nation's military. With each of them, you will hear how their 
service to America did not end when their time in the military came to 
an end. They have continued to contribute to their communities long 
after taking off their uniforms. They continue to uplift and inspire 
others around them, including myself. I would like to honor their 
commitment by thanking them today.
  Sgt. Ricardo Jaramillo is one of these great veterans, from Harvest, 
AL. Ricardo joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1976 at the age of 18. He 
deployed around the world, where he helped maintain American drones and 
surface-to-air missiles. He later became an instructor at the Redstone 
Arsenal in Huntsville, AL, preparing the next generation to protect our 
national security.
  Ricardo retired from the military in 1999 after 23 years of service, 
but his commitment to what America stands for doesn't end there. 
Ricardo wanted to continue serving his fellow man. After committing his 
life to Christ, Ricardo became a missionary so that he could spread 
hope to those in need all around the world.
  Now Ricardo takes multiple trips a year to the mountain villages in 
Guatemala with his two granddaughters, Gloria and Judiana. He credits 
the training he received as a marine for

[[Page S6503]]

preparing him to withstand the tough conditions that he experiences on 
his mission trips.
  Ricardo's lifelong dedication to serving others is an example to all 
of us.
  Thank you, Ricardo.
  I would also like to recognize SCPO Wayne Weeks of Geneva, AL. Wayne 
was motivated to join the U.S. Navy by his four uncles, who served in 
World War II. One of Wayne's uncles lost his life just 4 days after 
turning 21 years old during an Allied invasion of Italy.
  Wayne recalls attending his uncle's funeral as a small child and felt 
inspired to serve in the military as soon as he could. In 1953, at the 
age of 18, he courageously answered this calling and joined the Navy. 
Wayne traveled the oceans across the world, keeping our aircraft 
prepared for combat. He would serve until the end of the Vietnam war in 
1975. Despite the domestic turmoil and protests around that time, Wayne 
looks back positively on his time in the military.
  Wayne's determination to see a difficult war through from the 
beginning to the end demonstrates his integrity to finish the job he 
started. Wayne embodies the American grit that is foundational to our 
military servicemembers who have kept our country safe and the torch of 
liberty burning bright.
  Alabama is proud of Wayne and his wonderful wife Helen.
  Thank you for your service, Wayne.
  Finally, the strength of our military is dependent on the next 
generation of warriors who believe in our country and are willing to 
defend it. No one demonstrates this next generation of courage better 
than PO2 Alex Vogt of Hoover, AL.
  Alex says he felt he had a duty as an American who had benefited from 
the many opportunities our country offers to give back by joining the 
military, so he enlisted as a nuclear mechanic in the U.S. Navy in 
2016, deploying around the world to maintain our submarines. His final 
mission was decommissioning the USS Olympia submarine before he was 
discharged in 2021.
  When asked what Veterans Day means to him, Alex was quick to note the 
importance of using this day to show our gratitude for all veterans and 
their families. Alex and his wife Anna are now passing along this 
patriotic spirit to their twin boys, Charlie and Thomas.
  We want to thank you for your service, Alex. You are truly an 
inspiration to us all.
  These are just three Alabama veterans who sacrificed so much by 
serving our country. There are so many others who are also willing to 
give their lives for the great country that we have.
  I am reminded of my father, Charles Tuberville III, a World War II 
veteran. My father was one of the brave, young soldiers who landed and 
fought on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944. My dad remains an inspiration for 
me to this day. I will never forget his service to our country.
  As President Reagan said, ``Veterans have given their best for all of 
us, and we must continue to do our best by them.'' By observing 
Veterans Day this year, I hope we are encouraged to continue giving 
veterans our best.
  When you see a man or woman in uniform, please--please--take the time 
and thank them for their service. Because of their service and 
sacrifice, America remains a great beacon of freedom for generations to 
come.
  May God bless our veterans and their families.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I echo the comments of my colleague 
regarding the service of our veterans. They have stood up for us 
overseas, and we must stand up for them back here at home.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

                      Nomination of April M. Perry

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, it is my great privilege to help lead the confirmation of 
the Biden-Harris administration's judicial nominees. It is one of our 
committee's most important tasks, and confirming fair, evenhanded 
judges who are dedicated to the Constitution is one of my priorities as 
chair. But it is even more of an honor to help confirm judges from my 
State of Illinois.
  Today, I would like to take a moment to say a word in support of 
April Perry, who has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois. She is highly qualified and will 
strengthen the Federal bench.
  Ms. Perry is a highly accomplished litigator whose breadth of 
experience in the government and the private sector makes her an 
outstanding nominee. A double graduate of Northwestern University, Ms. 
Perry clerked on the Seventh Circuit before serving as an Assistant 
U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Illinois for more than a 
decade. In that role, she investigated and prosecuted a broad range of 
criminal cases.
  Additionally, Ms. Perry served as the Civil Rights and Hate Crimes 
coordinator, the Project Safe Childhood and Violence Against Women Act 
coordinator, and the Narcotics and Gangs Deputy chief in the U.S. 
attorney's office. Following this, Ms. Perry served in the Cook County 
State's attorney's office and has since expanded her legal experience 
as in-house counsel at GE Healthcare. Suffice it to say, Ms. Perry has 
proven herself an experienced, talented litigator with a dedication to 
the rule of law.
  Ms. Perry was rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar 
Association and has the strong support of Senator Duckworth and myself. 
I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.

                       REMEMBERING ANNA MAE WEEMS

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor Anna 
Mae Weems. Anna Mae was a standout citizen from Waterloo, who passed 
away in September after 98 years of life well-lived.
  My wife Barbara and I met Anna Mae during my first congressional 
campaign for elected office in 1974. Little did we know, our fast 
friendship would endure 50 cherished years. We were fortunate to get to 
know the Weems family. I was reminded recently of a story. Barbara had 
shared the Senate bean soup recipe with the Weems family, and they 
enjoyed it together each year.
  Anna Mae was always helping others and bridging connections. She 
fostered relationships for me with countless fellow Iowans, local 
groups, churches, and more. Her passion for civil rights and fierce 
advocacy against racial discrimination drove Anna Mae's work as a 
talented organizer. She facilitated a march in Waterloo to honor the 
20th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington 
and invited me to join. It was an important event that brought the 
community together. Anna Mae had marched on the picket line alongside 
Dr. King during the 1968 sanitation workers' strike in Memphis. At that 
time, she served as a prominent union leader at Rath Packing Company in 
Waterloo. She was the perfect person for the job. Change seemed to 
happen overnight when Anna Mae came around because she refused to rest 
until people paid attention. She never gave up on a cause she felt was 
unjust.
  In fact, I have Anna Mae to thank for bringing many causes to my 
attention. As a Senator, my No. 1 priority is to help Iowans the best I 
possibly can. She identified me as a resource to many Iowans who didn't 
know a Senator could help with their particular cases.
  Over the years, through frequent phone conversations, I learned from 
Anna Mae's insights--and about the ways she was making our community a 
better place. It was a privilege for Barbara and me to know Anna Mae, 
her extraordinary impact, and the positive mark she left wherever she 
went.

                       TRIBUTE TO JEANIE WILCOXON

<bullet> Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and 
recognize Jeanie Wilcoxon on being named Arkansas's 2025 Teacher of the 
Year by the Arkansas Department of Education.
  Jeanie is a fourth-grade math teacher at Chenal Elementary School in 
the Pulaski County Special School District in Little Rock. She has been 
a teacher for 25 years, 13 of which have been spent in this district.
  She is a graduate of Dumas High School who pursued higher education 
first at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, where she earned a 
bachelor of science in elementary and secondary physical education. She 
went on to complete postbaccalaureate work in elementary education at 
Louisiana State University.
  Jeanie displays an immense commitment to her students inside the 
classroom, and the results of her diligent and innovative approach are 
evident with her math students consistently ranking in the top 3 
percent of standardized test scores.
  Her dedication doesn't stop when the class bell rings. She also gives 
her time to academic and athletic extracurricular activities, including 
previously serving as a high school athletic coach and organizing clubs 
to promote skills like coding to help students apply their curriculum 
and lessons to the real world. Jeanie's efforts both inside and outside 
the classroom create a fun and dynamic learning environment that helps 
her students gain confidence and develop skills they need for future 
success.
  Throughout her career, Jeanie has been recognized by her peers and 
leaders for her successful instruction in addition to being beloved by 
students. She previously has been honored as the Pulaski County Special 
School District Teacher of the Year for 2023-2024 and earned the 
Iberville Parish Teacher of the Year award for 2006-2007.
  As part of her duties as Teacher of the Year for Arkansas, Jeanie 
will travel the State to share best practices and promote the teaching 
profession. She will also serve as a nonvoting member on Arkansas's 
State Board of Education.
  Jeanie's dedication towards her students exemplifies what it means to 
be a teacher, mentor, and leader, and I am extremely proud that she is 
receiving the recognition she richly deserves. I wish her the best of 
luck during her tenure as our State's top educator.<bullet>

      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PI GAMMA MU INTERNATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations 
to the Pi Gamma Mu International Honor Society on celebrating its 100th 
anniversary. As a proud member, I commend the work the society has done 
and continues to do in encouraging and promoting excellence in the 
world of social science disciplines.
  Social science studies are important because they help us understand 
one another, our government, and how we can help build a better world. 
One hundred years is an important milestone, and it represents the 
exceptional achievement and impact the society has around the world and 
in our country. I appreciate the unwavering commitment of Pi Gamma Mu 
toward contributing to philanthropic causes and intellectual spaces. 
One hundred years of service and achievement is rare, and it 
demonstrates the society's outstanding impact on young scholars.
  As a Senator and a member, I am pleased to send my best wishes to Pi 
Gamma Mu International Honor Society for this extraordinary 
accomplishment. On behalf of all Iowans and myself, I salute you on a 
job well done.

                          ____________________

                         TRIBUTE TO IAN MALLORY

<bullet> Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, Detective Ian Mallory stands out as 
an exceptional law enforcement professional with a steadfast commitment 
to justice and keeping Iowans safe. Throughout 8 years of service as a 
detective with the University of Iowa Police Department, Detective 
Mallory has consistently pursued investigations long after others might 
abandon them, demonstrating an unwavering drive to restore faith in the 
justice system for victims who had lost hope.
  Detective Mallory was recently honored with the U.S. Attorney for the 
Northern District of Iowa's 2024 Law Enforcement Victim Services Award. 
Ian's determination to resolve a three-decade-long identity theft 
scheme that stumped law enforcement, courts, banks, and government 
officials alike earned this accolade. Through an exhaustive 
investigation, Ian's breakthroughs brought a sophisticated web of 
deception to light and conclusively identified the fraudster.
  Detective Mallory's persistence was instrumental in resolving a case 
involving a suspect who fled to Jordan after being arrested for 
brutally strangling a woman until she was unconscious on the University 
of Iowa campus in April 2022. The suspect, facing charges of attempted 
murder and first-degree robbery and theft, escaped 10 days before trial 
by removing the court-ordered GPS ankle monitor. He then fled the 
country using a Jordanian passport.
  Undeterred, Detective Mallory successfully established a rapport with 
the suspect, overcoming the 8-hour time difference between Iowa and 
Jordan by often waking up in the middle of the night to maintain 
communication. Through his diligence, Detective Mallory persuaded the 
suspect to voluntarily return to the United States to face justice. 
Detective Mallory subsequently worked closely with the U.S. Embassy 
Overseas Criminal Investigations Unit in Jordan to meticulously plan 
the suspect's return.
  Detective Mallory's tireless service, integrity, and genuine concern 
for victims embodies the highest standards of law enforcement. We 
should all commend him for his exemplary service to the people of 
Iowa.<bullet>

                        TRIBUTE TO PATRICK JUMP

<bullet> Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, it is no secret that the COVID 
pandemic brought about a lot of unexpected challenges and, for some, 
even loss. But if you meet Cpl Patrick Jump of Robertsdale, you will 
hear about something positive that came from this dark time.
  Patrick enlisted in the Marines while in his senior year of high 
school. The son of a Vietnam veteran, Patrick knew what he was getting 
into when he signed up for the military. He remembers watching the Twin 
Towers fall while sitting in government class on September 11, 2001. 
But Patrick's desire to serve was unmoved. He served with ``Devil 
Dogs'' of First Battalion Sixth Marines, deploying to both Afghanistan 
and Iraq.
  After discharging from the military in 2006, Patrick missed the sense 
of community that came from being in the military. He reconnected and 
continued to rebuild these relationships as the years went by.
  When the COVID pandemic hit, he realized how great the need was to 
help veterans struggling with mental health. What began as a weekly 
virtual check-in with fellow soldiers, grew to a fulltime mission to 
help fellow veterans and their families. Patrick purchased a RV, 
traveling across 43 States before deciding to settle down in Baldwin 
County. Although not originally from Alabama, when Patrick discovered 
the region's patriotic spirit, he decided it was the perfect place to 
call home.
  He founded the Warrior Legacy Ranch to provide support to veterans 
struggling with their mental health. He has been a leader in fighting 
to prevent veteran suicides and expanding the sense of community for 
veterans--specifically those who served post-9/11. Patrick's efforts 
have not only helped veterans in Alabama, but all across the Nation.
  Alabama is grateful to have him on the frontlines of serving those 
who have honorably served us. It is my honor to recognize him as the 
November Veteran of the month.<bullet>

                 TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT FRANK PERRY

<bullet> Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, Senator Budd and I rise today to 
recognize Staff Sergeant Frank Perry, who is celebrating his 98th 
birthday this year. Mr. Perry served our Nation valiantly in World War 
II as a member of the U.S. Army Air Corps and is a respected and 
cherished member of the North Carolina triad community.
  During his service in WWII, Mr. Perry flew combat missions into 
Germany with the 754th Bombardment Squadron. He also served on a B-29 
Superfortress crew in preparation for troop movements in the Pacific.
  The brave men and women who served in World War II rightfully earned 
the title ``the Greatest Generation.'' Their courage and sacrifice 
changed the course of history, ultimately liberating Western Europe and 
much of Asia from fascism and ushering in an era of unprecedented 
prosperity here at home.
  After the war, Mr. Perry continued his career in aviation, eventually 
becoming a flight dispatcher based in Winston-Salem. He is a lifetime 
member of Winston-Salem Elks Lodge No. 449 and has served in various 
leadership positions.
  We are honored to join his family, friends, and community in 
recognizing his contributions to our Nation.<bullet>

             RECOGNIZING THE GUJARATI SAMAJ OF KANSAS CITY

<bullet> Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to 
the Gujarati Samaj of Kansas City, which celebrates the 25th 
anniversary of its founding this year. A values-based ethnolinguistic 
group with roots in Gujarat, India, the Gujarati people have a thriving 
community in Kansas City.
  On behalf of the State of Kansas, I express heartfelt appreciation 
for the ways in which Gujarat tradition enhances the cultural tapestry 
that defines America. The Gujarati Samaj of Kansas City have become a 
driving force for unity and harmony among Gujaratis in Kansas City, and 
the admirable achievements of this organization are deserving of 
commendation in the Congressional Record.
  This milestone anniversary is a testament to the Gujarati's 
unwavering commitment to preserving and promoting their rich cultural 
heritage in Kansas City. Over the past 25 years, the Gujarati Samaj of 
Kansas City's social, cultural, and educational events have 
strengthened and inspired the Gujarati community throughout the Kansas 
City area and across the world.
  The primary goals of the Gujarati Samaj of Kansas City include 
preserving and perpetuating its values-based culture, fostering a sense 
of belonging, and educating youth to become leaders of conscience--
virtues that enrich the present and ensure a prosperous future.
  I now ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the silver jubilee 
anniversary of the Gujarati Samaj of Kansas City.<bullet>

                     RECOGNIZING TADLOCK STOCKYARD

<bullet> Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to celebrate 
the 100-year anniversary of Tadlock Stockyard in Forest, MS, which was 
celebrated November 8, 2024. This fourth-generation, family-owned 
business is recognized as a cornerstone of the cattle industry in 
Mississippi for more than a century, serving producers as they seek to 
provide wholesome, safe, and nutritious beef to the American people.
  Originally founded by O.T. Bishop in 1924, the stockyard moved to its 
current location along Highway 35 in 1960 under the ownership of Luther 
and Ouida Jean Tadlock. David Tadlock, who assumed ownership of Tadlock 
Stockyard in 1974, has managed the sale barn and a weekly Monday sale 
at the current location ever since. The family-owned business is 
currently operated by all four members of the Tadlock family--David and 
Sandy Tadlock and daughters Greggina Brown and Char'lesa Tadlock.
  Given the remarkable changes in our Nation over the past 100 years, 
including economic disruptions and global competition, the success of 
Tadlock Stockyard is a testament to the fortitude and commitment of the 
Tadlock family.
  Tadlock Stockyard is the largest sale barn in Mississippi today, and 
it has consistently served to provide cattlemen across the State and 
region with a place to market their cattle. Given its proximity to 
Interstate 20, it serves as a hub for cattle marketing in the 
Southeast, especially as a gateway for stocker cattle to be shipped to 
feedlots out West.
  Recently, the stockyard raised over $35,000 for the victims of 
Hurricane Helene. During the sale on October 7, a Brangus heifer calf 
was donated by an anonymous producer and resold 18 times in 10 minutes. 
This represents the generosity of Mississippi cattlemen and women and 
the sense of community among them that Tadlock Stockyard has fostered 
over the past 100 years.
  Rural America is the backbone of this country, and Tadlock Stockyard 
is an important part of the backbone of rural Mississippi. I am 
thankful for the many important ways Tadlock Stockyard has contributed 
to the cattle industry and central Mississippi as a whole. I wish the 
stockyard and the Tadlock family continued success in their endeavors 
and look forward to watching another century of their legacy 
unfold.<bullet>

     designated the week beginning on October 13, 2024, as 
     National Wildlife Refuge Week; and

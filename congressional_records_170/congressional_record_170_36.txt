     HONORING SERGEANT RANDY ARMSTRONG AS VETERAN OF THE MONTH FOR 
                        MICHIGAN'S 9TH DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable 
valor and contributions of Randy Armstrong, our esteemed Veteran of the 
Month from Michigan's 9th Congressional District. It is with great 
honor that I highlight the exemplary service and dedication of this 
true American hero, whose courage and commitment have certainly left a 
mark on our Nation's history.
  Randy Armstrong, born and raised in Brown City, dedicated his entire 
childhood to the community that shaped him. His passion for baseball 
and humble beginnings, including his initial employment at the Brown 
City Bank, illustrate a profound--and proud--connection to his roots. 
In 1966, answering the call of duty, he enlisted for a three-year term 
alongside his brother at Fort Knox.
  Following his graduation from ordnance supply school, Randy's journey 
took him to Fort Lee, Virginia, and later to Scott Air Force Base, 
where he served with distinction in the Air Defense Command. His 
expertise as a radar operator led to his promotion to the rank of E4. 
In 1967, orders arrived for deployment to Vietnam, and before 1968, 
Randy found himself across the world. By January 1969, he had attained 
the rank of Sergeant E5.
  Completing his tour of duty, Randy returned to the United States, 
making his way to Fort Snelling in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was there, 
in acknowledgment of his honorable service, that he was discharged from 
the Army, marking the conclusion of a chapter defined by profound 
dedication to his country.
  In honoring Randy Armstrong, we pay tribute to a man whose journey 
from Brown City to the heart of Vietnam embodies the sacrifices and 
resilience of our armed forces. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in honoring this American patriot.

                       RECOGNIZING MADISON MARSH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LAUREN BOEBERT

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Madison Marsh, a 
distinguished second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force and the first 
active-duty service member to be crowned Miss America. Madison 
graduated from the Air Force Academy with a degree in physics and 
represents the epitome of dedication, intelligence, service, and class. 
She entered the world of pageantry motivated by a desire to serve and 
inspire others. and she has redefined what is possible for women across 
America.
  From a young age, Madison had a love of science and a dream to be a 
pilot and astronaut. Her parents encouraged her dreams, sending her to 
Space Camp when she was 13 years old where she met astronauts and 
fighter pilots.
  Around that time, she learned about the United States Air Force 
Academy and at 15 years old, started flying lessons. She earned her 
pilot's license two years later and then began to work towards her goal 
of becoming a cadet. Upon graduation from the and commissioning into 
the Air Force, she received a coveted pilot slot and is currently 
determining the career opportunities and personal projects she wants to 
pursue.
  Madison's accomplishments reach far beyond the Air Force and 
pageantry. She founded the Whitney Marsh Foundation to raise awareness 
and funds for pancreatic cancer research in memory of her mother.
  Madison is an exceptional role model for women and girls across our 
great country, teaching them that even the sky is not the limit. She is 
currently studying public policy as a graduate student at the Harvard 
Kennedy School, working to earn her master's degree. She is a two-time 
National Astronaut Scholar, National Rhodes Finalist, certified private 
pilot, black belt in tae kwon do, and U.S. Air Force Academy 
Superintendent's List NASA Intern.
  Mr. Speaker, Madison is an inspiration to women across America and a 
shining role model for all. I urge all Americans to join me in 
congratulating Madison on being crowned Miss America. Madison's journey 
reminds us of what we can accomplish when we work towards something 
greater than ourselves. I thank Madison for showing America what it 
means to be a Coloradoan.

    CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RAUL PERDOMO AND HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Raul 
Perdomo, a longtime resident of Southeast Michigan and a veteran of the 
Vietnam War, and to grieve his passing. His service to our country, 
both in the military and afterward, is worthy of commendation.
  Born on September 28, 1944, in Caracas, Venezuela, Raul moved to 
Dearborn, Michigan, at the age of 16. Following his graduation from 
Dearborn High, he became a naturalized citizen and answered our 
nation's highest calling when he joined the United States Navy to serve 
in the Vietnam War. This set the stage for a lifetime of service to his 
community and to his country. After his military service, Raul returned 
to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and enrolled at the University of Michigan 
where he studied anthropology before studying business at Eastern 
Michigan University.
  As a graduate of the University of Michigan, Raul was one of the most 
enthusiastic supporters of the Wolverines. His hearty ``Go Blue!'' and 
love for the Maize and Blue was known by anyone who met him, whether 
through his 40 years of work for the University of Michigan Athletics 
Department, as President of the U-M Club of Tampa Bay, the Central Cafe 
and Beer Depot in Ann Arbor, or during his time helping run the Ann 
Arbor Community Recreation and Education Center. Public service 
remained at the forefront of Raul's life, and even after retiring from 
the military. he remained just as committed to serving his community, 
which included 20 years of research and tenure on the Institutional 
Review Board at the Ann Arbor VA Hospital, and as a patient advocate as 
the University of Michigan Frankel Cardiovascular Center.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
life of Raul to our nation. A naturalized citizen answering his 
country's highest calling, he served his country with bravery and honor 
in the Vietnam War before continuing to serve his local communities 
after leaving the military, bringing joy, enthusiasm, and love to 
everyone he met along the way.

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a special 
man, William K. (Buddy) Wheeler of Lexington, Kentucky. He passed away 
on February 8, 2024.
  Mr. Wheeler was born in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. He met his future 
wife Lucy Clay in grade school. He graduated in 1952 from Mt. Sterling 
High School. He went on to the University of Kentucky, where he 
graduated from the College of Pharmacy in 1956. He opened Wheeler 
Pharmacy in 1958 in the Chevy Chase neighborhood, which was on the 
outskirts of Lexington at that time. Wheeler Pharmacy is a Lexington 
landmark, enjoyed by many regular patrons including myself. In addition 
to the pharmacy, customers enjoy the soda fountain, serving breakfast 
and lunch and providing a warm neighborhood atmosphere.
  Mr. Wheeler was an innovator, implementing a computerized dispensing 
system, compounding service, and a medication management program and 
much more. He welcomed pharmacy students for their rotations and served 
as a mentor to them. Mr. Wheeler sold the pharmacy to his daughter in 
2020 but remained an active presence. He was known for his unwavering 
dedication to his profession and for his kindness to all.
  Mr. Wheeler is survived by his wife Lucy. They had been married for 
nearly 70 years.

[[Page E184]]

He also leaves 4 children and their spouses: William Kendall (Tammy) 
Wheeler, Jr., Stuart (Karen) Wheeler, Margaret (Kevin) Meredith, and 
Claire (Darrell) Lewis. They are all involved in the family business. 
He also leaves nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
  Buddy Wheeler will long be remembered as a kind and caring person, 
and he will be greatly missed. It was my honor to know him and call him 
my friend. I am grateful for the opportunity to lift up the life of 
Buddy Wheeler before the United States Congress.

          HONORING THE CAREER AND IMPACT OF COACH LANNY BOOHER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable legacy 
of Anaheim High School Football Coach Lanny Booher. For two decades, 
Coach Booher has been a beacon of inspiration and mentorship in our 
Anaheim community, leaving a significant mark on the hearts of his 
players and community.
  Stepping down after 20 years of dedication to our shared alma mater, 
Anaheim High School, Coach Booher leaves a legacy of transformation and 
triumph. In 2004, he took charge of a struggling football team--but 
through his leadership and mentorship, Coach Booher was able to change 
the trajectory of the program and his players. Over the next two 
decades, Coach Booher led the Anaheim football team to success on the 
field, including accomplishing eleven playoff appearances and securing 
three Orange League championships.
  Coach Lanny Booher's commitment and love for the game and his 
community has been evident in every milestone and achievement. More 
importantly, his passion for his players has made his two decades of 
impact a cornerstone of our community. His impact extends far beyond 
the football field, shaping the lives of young athletes off the field 
by teaching them the value of teamwork and perseverance.
  Throughout his coaching career, Lanny Booher accumulated an 
impressive 100 wins at Anaheim High, making him the coach with the 
second-most wins in Orange County. One of his most notable 
achievements, a 22-10 victory in the Orange County All-Star Football 
Classic in 2007, is a moment that will surely live forever in local 
memory.
  By honoring the legacy of Coach Booher, we celebrate more than just 
victories on the field--we celebrate the profound impact he's had on 
every student who has played for him. There is no doubt that his legacy 
while at Anaheim High School will continue to inspire generations of 
young athletes to give back to their community and put their all into 
the game.
  I thank Coach Booher for his two decades of dedication. Go Colonists.

                   HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD MAGUDA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
accomplishments of Mr. Donald ``Don'' J. Maguda of Rockville, 
Connecticut. Aged 90, Donald passed peacefully on December 9, 2023, 
surrounded by family. Donald was a leader in his community and embraced 
a love for helping others that he held dear throughout his life.
  Born July 11, 1933, to Joseph Maguda and Stella Taylor in New 
Britain, Connecticut. Donald purposed his life toward protecting his 
community and leading with compassion. He graduated from Rockville High 
School, immediately after which he began a long and rewarding career as 
a fireman. Donald began his service with the Snipsic Hook and Ladder 
Company. Here, Donald was identified as a born leader and rose through 
the ranks of the Rockville Fire Department. In 1967, Donald's attention 
to detail and devotion to his work was rewarded when he became Chief of 
the department.
  As Chief, Donald used his leadership to coordinate and oversee the 
consolidation of the Rockville Fire Deparlment and Vernon Fire District 
into the Town of Vernon Fire Department. After the merger, Donald 
served as Fire Chief of the newly formed Vernon Fire Department in 
1980, still leaving time for his other passion, running his business, 
Maguda's Woodworking Shop. After decades of leadership with the fire 
department, in 1986 Donald transitioned to the role of Town of Vernon 
Fire Marshal until his retirement in 2002, concluding a remarkable 
nearly 50-year career during which he never lost a firefighter in the 
line of duty.
  Equipped with extensive knowledge in his field and a desire to share 
that knowledge with anyone who needed it, it is no surprise that Donald 
was a member of the Connecticut State Firefighters Association and the 
Connecticut Fire Marshals Association. Donald presented to numerous 
groups and individuals for better fire education and community 
involvement.
  Donald's work ethic and dedication to his community rubbed off on his 
son David, who followed in his footsteps to serve as a firefighter for 
42 years--most of which he spent serving under his father.
  In addition to this incredible work as a firefighter, Donald spent 
innumerable hours giving back to his community in other ways as well. 
In the 1960s, he was integral in starting ``Toys for Tots'' in Vernon, 
assisting children and families during the holidays and ``Christmas in 
April.'' Mr. Speaker, as a citizen of the town of Vernon who held 
elective office over the years, I had the privilege to know Don and see 
up close his intelligence, kindness, and unstinting devotion to duty. 
Our town was so blessed to know Don and to have his positive, critical 
contribution that saved lives and protected property.
  In his free time, Donald spent time with his family, those most 
important to him. They enjoyed taking vacations and cruises. Donald 
could also be found landscaping, woodworking, playing golf, and playing 
cards with friends and family.
  Though we mourn this incredible loss, we can find solace in knowing 
that Donald's memory and legacy will live on through his family and the 
countless number of individuals who knew him. Donald is survived by his 
beloved wife of 64 years, Gabrielle, his son David and his wife 
Michelle, his daughter Donna and her husband Jeffrey, and countless 
nieces and nephews. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to know and represent 
constituents as purposeful in their work as Donald. As we memorialize 
Donald's faithful service. I ask that my colleagues join me in paying 
tribute to Donald Maguda.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Mr. 
Raymond Flores, a World War II veteran and native of San Antonio, Texas 
who recently celebrated his 102nd birthday at San Antonio's Boss Ross 
Senior Center. Born February 28, 1922, to Mauro Flores and Dorothea 
Martinez, Mr. Flores has spent his life dedicated to public service.
  Following his graduation from Luther Burbank High School in 1941, Mr. 
Flores spent the greater part of a year working for the Civilian 
Conservation Corps in Dallas Texas, helping the country recover from 
the Great Depression. In December of that year, Mr. Flores answered the 
Nation's call and enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps to help defend 
freedoms overseas. Mr. Flores completed a tour of duty in the Southern 
and Western Pacific where he served as Air Freight Master in Papua New 
Guinea and as First Cook in Australia. Mr. Flores then returned 
stateside, where he served as First Cook at Camp Kearns in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, before being transferred back home to Fort Sam Houston in 
San Antonio, Texas. It was there on September 30, 1945, that Mr. Flores 
received his honorable discharge along with other accommodations for 
his time in service.
  After his return to civilian life, Mr. Flores attended San Antonio 
College. In early spring 1948, Mr. Flores met Margarita Gomez and they 
were married later that year on June 27, 1948, at San Fernando 
Cathedral. Over the following three decades, Mr. Flores continued his 
tradition of service, working for the United States Postal Service 
until he retired, with commendation from President Jimmy Carter, in 
December 1980.
  Mr. Flores is currently living in a VA assisted living care facility 
where he brings life and joy to those around him. Before his beloved 
wife Margarita passed in 2019, she and Mr. Flores celebrated seventy-
one years of marriage together. When asked what he is proudest of, Mr. 
Flores cites his fifty-two years of volunteer service to the St. 
Vincent De Paul Society, where he was an officer from 1952 to 2004 at 
the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Little Flower. When asked 
what lesson he wishes to pass onto the next generation, Mr. Flores 
asked that we all pray and keep the Lord in our lives.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the long life and 
honorable achievements of Mr. Raymond Flores. His story is a testament 
to his character and his status as the pride of San Antonio. May God 
bless him and his family for all their years to come.

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Post 1136 in Wyandotte, Michigan on the 100th anniversary

  The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States dates back to 
September 29, 1899, when it was founded in Columbus, Ohio following the 
return of Americans from the campaign in the Spanish-American war. 
Founded by a small group of veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars was 
founded to build upon them a spirit of comradeship only known to those 
who faced the dangers of war fighting side-by-side.
  Post 1136 has a long and notable history of service. Throughout World 
War II, the Post sent gifts and home newspapers to the men and women 
serving all over the United States and the world. They continued 
serving the veterans as they returned home, creating a special Ritual 
Team to escort the returning bodies of their fallen comrades and to 
conduct military funerals. Although the Ritual Team was disbanded, in 
the late fifties, the Service Officer Burial Detail was formed and 
became known as the ``Wyandotte Honor Guard.'' They still serve their 
fallen comrades even today. Post 1136 grew to over 1,000 members on 
March 25, 1970, at the height of the Vietnam War. Throughout war time, 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1136 has been steadfast in its 
commitment to supporting our troops at home and abroad. With financial 
struggles and lower membership following the Vietnam War, Post 1136 
gained strength once again as the United States liberated Kuwait from 
Iraqi occupation. Renewed efforts by the post allowed for continued 
campaigns of support for our troops abroad, with Post 1136 donating 
food, toiletries, cigarettes, and other items in short supply to those 
on the battlefield.
  Over the decades since its founding, Post 1136 in Wyandotte, Michigan 
has continued to give back to its community by hosting an annual 4th of 
July parade that it first started in 1939, memorial services for those 
lost in the September 11th attacks, charity fundraisers, and the 
construction of memorials for the brave heroes who lost their lives in 
the Vietnam War along the main boulevard that features inscriptions and 
poems written by community members. Committed to the cause of helping 
our service members, Post 1136 admirably helps veterans with health 
issues gain access to a variety of medical and social benefits and 
become comfortable at home following their return from combat.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
100th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1136 in 
Wyandotte, Michigan. For the last century, their members have continued 
serving their community well after being out of uniform. We thank them 
for their service, both at home and abroad, and are excited to see what 
they can accomplish over the next 100 years.

                          ____________________

               CELEBRATING WILLA HARTER'S 101ST BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ZACHARY NUNN

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Ms. Willa Harter 
of Bloomfield, Iowa a very happy 101st birthday.
  Ms. Harter was born in Colorado on February 27, 1923. A survivor of 
scarlet fever at just four years old and left with only half her 
hearing, she learned to read lips at an early age. Ms. Harter's family 
moved to Iowa in December of 1933, and she graduated from Bloomfield 
High School in 1940. Two years later, she married her husband Marion 
Harter and together they raised four children: Nancy, Betty, Tom 
Harter, and Mary Jo.
  During her life she wore many different hats. She taught school, 
worked as a telephone operator at the Drakesville switchboard, and 
spent 27 years working at the Davis County Hospital. Willa's love and 
care was shown through her dedication at the hospital and at home with 
her children. Ms. Harter also has extensive experience crocheting 
afghans for every one of her children, her twelve grandchildren, twenty 
great grandchildren, and ten great-great grandchildren.
  In addition to a full life at home in Iowa, Ms. Harter has seen her 
fair share of adventures, traveling to all 50 states, as well as Asia, 
Europe, South America, and Australia. Now, her daily adventure is 
enjoying retirement by doing puzzles and reading books in her 
Bloomfield home.
  I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Willa Harter's life 
and achievements as we wish her a very happy 101st birthday. I extend 
my congratulations and best wishes to her and her family.

                          ____________________

                         RECOGNIZING ROB ZERJAV

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. Rob Zerjav 
for being named the 2023 Baseball America (BA) Minor League Baseball 
Executive of the Year.
  A native of Green Bay, Rob began his career in 1997 as an unpaid 
intern with the team. During this time, his work ethic and love for the 
team became clear, and in the years following, Rob joined the full-time 
staff as a group sales representative. After two years in this 
position, Rob was promoted to Director of Baseball Operations and then 
to Vice President of Operations. Following the 2002 season, Rob was 
named Team President and General Manager, and in 2020, Rob purchased 
the team and stadium with partners Craig Dickman and Brad Raaths. This 
purchase made Appleton baseball club history as it became the first-
ever private ownership group.
  Throughout his years with the Timber Rattlers, Rob has remained 
focused on the organization's success and lived the organization's 
mission of ``creating the best entertainment experience in Wisconsin so 
that every guest walks away with a smile and the desire to return.'' I 
applaud Rob for his dedication and thank him for his years of service 
to the organization and community.
  It is clear that Rob's leadership and skills have played a critical 
role in the success of the Timber Rattlers. Since Rob assumed the role 
of General Manager, the Timber Rattlers have been recognized for many 
different achievements. In 2012, the team received the Larry MacPhail 
Award, Minor League Baseball's highest award in promotional excellence. 
The team was also recognized for its success in 2005, 2018, and 2019 
when it received the Midwest League President's Award. As Rob marks his 
28th year in Minor League Baseball, I wish him many more successful 
seasons and thank him for his leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Mr. Rob Zerjav for 
being named the 2023 Baseball America Minor League Baseball Executive 
of the Year. Rob's unwavering service and commitment to the Wisconsin 
Timber Rattlers and Northeast Wisconsin deserves the highest degree of 
recognition.

         RECOGNIZING ALEX FERREIRA'S X GAMES SUPERPIPE VICTORY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LAUREN BOEBERT

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Ms. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Alex 
Ferreira, an exceptional athlete hailing from Aspen, Colorado, who has 
once again earned a gold medal in the men's Ski SuperPipe at the Winter 
X Games. This is the third time Alex has won the X Games for the United 
States. He is an inspiration to us all, and he has shown the world what 
it means to be an American and a Coloradan.
  The X Games invite athletes from across the world to compete in 
extreme sports, including skateboarding, BMX, motocross, snowboarding, 
and skiing. The SuperPipe event stands out among the events as a 
monumental challenge, allowing athletes to utilize towering walls to 
showcase breathtaking aerial tricks. The Winter X Games take athletes 
to the heart of Aspen to show off their skills to the world. Alex did 
not have to go far to remind us all, once again, that he had what it 
takes to win the X Games for a third time.
  Alex's journey reminds us of what we can accomplish when we embrace 
difficulties and continue to push on. Time and time again, Alex kept 
going after setbacks that would have caused many people to give up. 
Last year's competition left him with two hard falls, a disappointing 
finish, and critics calling for his retirement. But Alex never gave up. 
At this year's X Games, he won not only for himself but for every young 
athlete across America who looks up to him.
  Mr. Speaker, Alex Ferreira is a true inspiration to athletes across 
our nation, and I am incredibly proud to honor him today. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating Alex for his spectacular win at 
the X Games and for redefining what it means to be a Coloradan. Alex is 
the best that Colorado's Third Congressional District has to offer, and 
his story pushes us all to strive for greatness.

                               COMMUNITY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional 
dedication and contributions of Ms. Angela LoPiccolo, better known as 
``Ms. LoPo'' by her students from Dakota High School in Michigan's 9th 
Congressional District. It is with great honor that I highlight the 
exemplary service and educational leadership of a truly remarkable 
educator, whose passion and commitment have profoundly impacted the 
academic and personal lives of countless students.
  Beginning her career as a student teacher at Chippewa Valley Schools, 
Ms. LoPiccolo has devoted her life to teaching Advanced Placement 
United States History, global history, and comparative government 
courses. After a brief tenure at Fitzgerald High School, she returned 
to Dakota High School, where she has remained a pillar of knowledge and 
guidance for the last 18 years.
  Ms. LoPiccolo's dedication to the field of political science, 
government, and United States history was inspired by the influential 
instructors and mentors in her own life. She has become a beloved 
figure at Dakota High School, known for her ability to identify and 
nurture her students' academic strengths, and for her commitment to 
building meaningful relationships with each of them. Her role extends 
beyond teaching; she serves as the advisor to the Dakota High School 
Chapter of Rho Kappa Social Studies Honor Society and has previously 
advised the National Honor Society and Senior Class Council.
  Her accolades, including being named the 2022 High School Teacher of 
the Year at Chippewa Valley Schools and receiving the Excellence in 
Education Award in 2016 from the Michigan Lottery, are testaments to 
her exceptional service and dedication to education. Currently, she 
teaches advanced placement courses in United States history and micro 
and macroeconomics, continuing to inspire and shape the minds of future 
generations.
  Ms. LoPiccolo holds an MAT from Marygrove College in Detroit and a BA 
in history and political science from Oakland University. Her 
educational background, combined with her passion and dedication, has 
made her an invaluable asset to Dakota High School and the community at 
large.
  Ms. Angela LoPiccolo's life and career represents the values of 
educational excellence, dedication, and commitment that are so crucial 
in academics. Her service as an educator during a pivotal time in our 
nation's history reminds us of the profound impact that one individual 
can have on shaping the minds and futures of our youth.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this 
wonderful leader for her commitment to education and enabling future 
generations to uphold the values of knowledge, democracy, and civic 
engagement that have defined our nation.

Williams as the recipient of Inspire Life's Impact Award. Aaron and the 
Asbury Park Tennis Initiative were recognized at Inspire Life's 2024

  Founded by Aaron in 2021, the Asbury Park Tennis Initiative aims to 
introduce tennis to local children while instilling the values of 
discipline, self-confidence, sportsmanship, and leadership. Playing 
tennis throughout his life, Aaron knows firsthand the benefits of the 
sport. Recognizing the lack of access to the sport, Aaron established 
the Asbury Park Tennis Initiative to create opportunities for Asbury 
Park's students to experience tennis and the life skills it helps 
develop. He has partnered with local schools, churches, and community 
organizations to connect with the city's youth, providing not only 
tennis lessons but also mentoring and community involvement. Aaron's 
commitment to the success of the program is evident and his dedication 
is admirable.
  Aaron's work with the Asbury Park Tennis Initiative is indicative of 
his commitment to public service and as United States Marine Corps 
veteran and an LGBTQ advocate, he has dedicated his life to serving his 
community and Nation. His passion to help others and improve our 
communities is commendable and he exemplifies honor, integrity, and 
professionalism in each endeavor he undertakes.
  Mr. Speaker, I join Inspire Life in recognizing Aaron Williams and 
the Asbury Park Tennis Initiative for their impact on Asbury Park's 
youth. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in thanking 
Aaron for his service to our Nation and local communities.

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Master 
Sergeant Kevin Johnson, Sr.
  Originally of Philadelphia, MSG Johnson enlisted in the Army in 1984, 
marking the beginning of his lifelong career in service to his country. 
After completing basic training at Ft. Jackson in South Carolina, MSG 
Johnson went on to Advanced Individual Training at Ft. Gordon, Georgia 
and later participated in the Home Town Recruiting Assistance Program 
where he helped to recruit 10 soldiers and prepare them for entry into 
the Army by assisting them to pass their ASVAB tests and improve their 
physical fitness.
  MSG Johnson would go on to serve in several different posts including 
as a Station Technical Controller in Germany with the 581st Signal 
Company and as a member of the White House Communications Agency where 
he supported the critical Direct Communication Link between the White 
House and the Kremlin during an era of heightened diplomatic relations 
between the Soviet Union and United States.
  Later in his career, MSG Johnson transferred to the U.S. Army 
Reserve, proudly serving with the 80th division for 25 years during 
which he dedicated himself to training new soldiers, first as a Drill 
Sergeant and then as a Senior Drill Sergeant with B Company in Suffolk, 
VA. Deploying with the 80th during Operation Iraqi Freedom, he served 
as a Platoon Sergeant for the 3rd Iraqi Army Division Basic Combat 
Training.
  Holder of multiple professional certifications in IT and 
Telecommunications, MSG Johnson has spent his career preparing 
generations of soldiers for the tasks they face during deployment and 
building upon his own education to ensure his instruction is of the 
highest quality possible. Throughout his service, MSG Johnson received 
a number of awards including the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army 
Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal.
  The proud father to Kevin Jr., Yasmeen, Courtney, and Kazmir I and 
husband to Tiniko Johnson, MSG Johnson is a shining example of 
dedication to service and patriotism. I extend my most sincere thank 
you to MSG Johnson and his family for their sacrifice and commend him 
for a career of selflessness.

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I joined thousands of people in 
Minnesota who gathered for the public funeral for Burnsville Police 
Officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, and Firefighter-Paramedic 
Adam Finseth who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
  On Sunday, February 18, 2024, these courageous public servants 
answered a call to protect a family and our community, and were gunned 
down in a horrific act of violence. This heartbreaking incident occurs 
amid a crisis of gun violence and domestic abuse, and our first 
responders are on the front lines every day.
  Officers Elmstrand and Ruge dedicated their lives to protecting our 
community. Firefighter-Paramedic Finseth was committed to saving lives, 
as he was attempting to do that day. He also served our Nation proudly 
in the U.S. Army, twice deploying on tours of duty in Iraq. Their 
deaths in the line of duty are a devastating tragedy that touches their 
families, their fellow first responders, the Burnsville community, the 
state of Minnesota, and our Nation.
  I extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends who 
loved them. Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered and 
honored.

               HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MARK SMAIL

                                 ______

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Mark Smail, who sadly passed away at the age of 62 on 
February 17, 2024.
  A graduate of Hempfield Area High School and the University of 
Pittsburgh-Johnstown, Mark joined the family business at Smail Auto 
Group and spent the next 40 years establishing the company as an 
institutional pillar of the Westmoreland County business community. 
Mark replaced his father as General Manager in 2018 and became the 
third generation of the Smail family to lead the business.
  Mark distinguished himself through his leadership, business acumen, 
and dedication to the community. The Westmoreland County Chamber of 
Commerce named Smail Auto Group the 2021 Business of the Year, largely 
due to the company's ability to keep all 500 employees on staff during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark's continuous participation in industry and 
community associations also earned widespread praise. In recognition of 
his commitment to civic engagement, the Pennsylvania Automotive 
Association awarded Mark the 2021 Bud Smail Political Advocacy Award. 
The award pays homage to Mark's late father, who inspired him to work 
hard and give back to his community.
  Mark shared his father's determination to give back to the community 
and strived to make southwestern Pennsylvania a better place to live. 
As a philanthropist, Mark raised millions of dollars for local 
nonprofits. He contributed to and volunteered with many organizations, 
including the Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, the 
Magee-Women's Research Institute and Foundation, the Troops First 
Foundation, the Westmoreland Cultural Trust, and the Westmoreland Food 
Bank.
  As a devoted husband and father, Mark cherished his friends and 
family. Mark will be remembered by his wife of 35 years, Kelly, and 
their children, Taylor and Marcus. His memory will undoubtedly serve as 
an example of love, devotion to one's family, and selfless service.
  Mr. Speaker, Mark Smail dedicated his life to the people of 
Westmoreland County and southwestern Pennsylvania. His legacy is the 
epitome of a life well-lived. On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 
14th Congressional District, I wish his family healing during this 
difficult time.

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Bryan

Department after 25 years of service to the city of Canton, Michigan. 
His decades of service to our community is worthy of commendation.
  Officer Szostak joined the Canton Police Department in 1999 and has

he has been a member of the department's Honor Guard as one of the 
founding members and leader, with which he has participated in Posting 
of the Colors for ceremonies across the state and funeral services for 
fallen officers. Officer Szostak also served the community's youth as a 
veteran advisor for the Explorer Unit, a program for teenagers 
interested in law enforcement. In these roles, Officer Szostak has 
showed his emphatic commitment to the units he has been involved in.
  Most notably, Officer Szostak has been a committed Canine Officer for 
the past 20 years. His loyalty and passion for this program has been 
exemplified in his love for his current canine partner Ragnar, who is 
retiring alongside Officer Szostak, as well as his two previous canine 
partners, Poncho and Hoss. In this role, Officer Szostak has set new 
standards for training and policing, which will not soon be forgotten. 
Over the course of his extensive career, Officer Szostak earned many 
department awards, in addition to citizen recognitions for his service 
and commitmment to improving the city.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Officer Bryan 
Szostak for his remarkable 25 years of service. His commitment to the 
canine program, Canton Police Department, and the City of Canton has 
been dedicated to the safety and improvement of the community. I join 
Officer Szostak's family, friends, and colleagues in extending my best 
wishes to him in retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
a community leader and advocate, Mr. Alan Nishio.
  Mr. Nishio was an activist, educator, and tireless organizer. Born in 
the Manzanar incarceration camp in 1945, Mr. Nishio spent his life 
uplifting the Japanese American community in his many roles, including 
as the longest-tenured Board President for the Little Tokyo Service 
Center. Mr. Nishio was also the founder of UCLA's Asian American 
Studies program in 1968.
  Mr. Nishio advocated for the Japanese community in Little Tokyo and 
beyond. As founder and co-chair of the National Coalition of Redress/
Reparations, Mr. Nishio worked tirelessly to provide rightful 
compensation to Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II.
  Mr. Nishio was not only a mover and a changemaker, but a genuinely 
kind individual. Mr. Nishio always focused on the bigger picture, 
emphasizing the importance of building strong relationships between the 
Japanese American community and other communities throughout Los 
Angeles.
  Mr. Nishio's legacy will live on in the Japanese American community 
in Little Tokyo, and beyond.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Mr. Alan Nishio.

           CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JOB CORPS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JARED F. GOLDEN

                                of maine

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. GOLDEN of Maine. Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the Job 
Corps program on 60 years of dedicated support in changing the lives of 
young Americans. 2024 marks six decades of ambition and hope for our 
young Mainers at the centers in Limestone and Bangor, and throughout 
the United States of America. Maine's Job Corps programs are vital for 
preparing young people in the Great State of Maine for high demand 
industry sector employment as well as furthering educational 
opportunities.
  I join my congressional colleagues in honoring and supporting their 
mission to better the

[[Page E188]]

lives of Mainers through technical and academic training. Since the 
first class of students in 1997, the Loring Job Corps Center in 
Limestone has helped students from Maine and across the Nation earn 
high school diplomas, construct long-term careers, and obtain great 
jobs. The Penobscot Job Corps has maintained the same mission for the 
past 45 years.
  Education and community service alike are two of the cornerstones of 
both Job Corps Centers in Maine, resulting in the students not only 
changing their lives but the lives of those around them. The program's 
outreach and development with workforce partners has only enhanced its 
ability to reach out and enrich the lives of young Mainers. The Job 
Corps program encourages the vital education and creativity of bright 
young students throughout our country.
  It is with great pride and appreciation that I congratulate our two 
Maine Centers and Job Corps for 60 years of critical work.

        RECOGNIZING NEW HAMPSHIRE'S POLL WORKERS AND VOLUNTEERS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANN M. KUSTER

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important work 
of New Hampshire's poll workers and volunteers, who oversaw a safe, 
secure election in the first-in-the-nation primary that took place on 
Tuesday, January 23, 2024.
  For more than 100 years, New Hampshire has been proud to host our 
country's first presidential primary, an honor our state takes very 
seriously. This primary would not be possible without New Hampshire's 
dedicated poll workers and volunteers. This year, like every time 
before, our poll workers demonstrated the power of our democracy and 
the importance of civic responsibility by dutifully and earnestly 
conducting this year's election.
  I want to thank these citizens for stepping up for our democracy. New 
Hampshire's poll workers continue to set an example for the nation in 
their tireless efforts to count every vote and ensure that the voices 
of all Granite Staters are heard at the ballot box. These poll workers 
prove that despite ongoing efforts to polarize or politicize our 
elections, our American democracy is strong. Granite Stater poll 
workers help inspire increased voter confidence and turnout and ensure 
a smoother process for our state's elections. It is critical that all 
communities throughout our state are able to have their voices heard in 
our democracy.
  Poll workers, local town officials, and volunteers are instrumental 
to our electoral process, preserving the right to vote for all 
Americans by remaining impartial and fair throughout the process, from 
overseeing voter registration to processing ballots. All Americans 
deserve to have their voices represented.
  Mr. Speaker, I say thank you again to all of the poll workers and 
volunteers who stepped up to serve their communities and our democracy.

   HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CAPTAIN BENJAMIN MOULTON

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor five of our precious 
fallen Marines, including Captain Benjamin Moulton, who were killed in 
a helicopter crash last week in California.
  At 27 years old, Captain Moulton was known for his leadership and 
determination. Benjamin grew up with family roots in Emmett, Idaho, and 
received an ROTC scholarship to the University of Washington. Once 
commissioned into the Marines in 2019, Benjamin continued to strive for 
excellence and was promoted to Captain in August of last year.
  Captain Moulton was a decorated pilot who flew with precision and 
skill, navigating through challenges with grace and determination. His 
love for aviation and his commitment to excellence inspired all who had 
the privilege to serve alongside him.
  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Moulton family and friends as 
they mourn the loss of this remarkable Marine. We are inspired by 
Benjamin's bravery and his service to our Nation will never be 
forgotten.

            HONORING THE SERVICE OF BENJAMIN ``BEN'' COOPER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the inspiring 
life and noble career of a lifelong Connecticut resident and patriot, 
Mr. Benjamin ``Ben'' Cooper. A member of America's ``Greatest 
Generation'' who honorably served in the U.S. Armed Forces in World War 
II, Mr. Cooper witnessed the unspeakable horror of mass casualties and 
genocide that occurred in the European theater. Rather than suppressing 
this experience, he made it a mission to share the unspeakable 
tragedies he witnessed on the frontlines of the War. He transformed his 
experience into lessons for high school students and taught kindness 
and empathy for others. His service and lessons have inspired many 
generations of American citizens to care for each other with the same 
sincerity and dedication seen in Mr. Cooper himself.
  Born in 1921 to Max and Fannie Cooper, Ben is a lifelong resident of 
West Hartford, Connecticut. Ben attended Hall High School and graduated 
in 1940. After attending George Washington University for one year, he 
returned to Connecticut in 1941 and worked at Colt Arms Factory in 
Hartford. Despite not having officially joined the military yet, Ben 
contributed to the war effort through his testing of guns for the Colt 
Company. Come 1942, Ben had been drafted into the U.S. Army as a combat 
medic in the 45th Infantry Division. Soon after his drafting, Ben met 
his wife of 65 years, Dorothy, and they married on July 14, 1944, in a 
Maine synagogue shortly before he was deployed to serve in the European 
theater. Ben's selfless nature manifested through his becoming a medic, 
starting a long legacy of sacrifice and consummate service to those in 
need. Through his service, Ben served as a shining beacon in an all-
enveloping sea of darkness. His service safeguarded the life and 
liberty of his fellow citizens and the peoples across Europe.
  Unforgettably, the U.S. Army 45th Infantry helped liberate Dachau 
concentration camp in 1945. Alongside his fellow soldiers, Ben bore 
witness to the deplorable condition of the victims of the concentration 
camp. Darkness and inhumanity enveloped Dachau. The scent of 
incinerated flesh hung heavily on the camp's air, and its prisoners 
stood in front of their liberators emaciated, so weak that any attempt 
at nourishment was rejected by their broken bodies. The extent of these 
crimes against humanity and decency left Ben speechless and 
traumatized. He would not speak of the camp or war experiences for 
decades to come.
  In 1990, Ben began to share his wartime experiences. Through an 
interview with a Torrington High School history teacher, Ben was able 
to open up about his personal history. This interview served as the 
genesis of

[[Page E189]]

Ben's new mission: to teach America's future generations of the impact 
of prejudice and bigotry, and to promote kindness and compassion. He 
spoke at many high schools, including Simsbury and Hall, about his 
wartime experiences. His lessons always included advocacy for kindness. 
He brought historical events from textbooks to life through his lived 
memories. Ben hoped that teaching this part of history would ensure 
that it would never be repeated.
  In 2010, Ben met Henny Simon, a liberated victim of the Nazi 
concentration camps. Until her death in 2017, the two visited high 
schools in Connecticut and taught classes on WWII. Students across 
Connecticut gained valuable insight on how precious a thing our 
liberties and rights are, and how fiercely they need to be defended. 
The pair were offered to include their experiences in a documentary 
titled ``In Times of War.'' Fortunately, their stories have been 
immortalized through their lessons and the documentary and countless 
news articles.
  Mr. Speaker, even in the darkest hour of our civilization, courageous 
truth tellers like Ben Cooper refuse to be silenced by fear or 
indifference. Ben's impact on our nation's citizens is immeasurable, 
and scores of young citizens will remember his stories and examples. 
Regrettably understanding the savagery of Nazi barbarism is of critical 
importance in the world we live in today. Our country should honor 
Ben's gentle kindness and conviction that touched thousands of fellow 
Americans. I ask that my colleagues join me in immortalizing Ben's 
story.

  RECOGNIZING THE MARITIME SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE COUNCIL'S PLAN TO 
                       MODERNIZE THE USMMA CAMPUS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Academy Congressional Board of Visitors to thank the 
experts of the Maritime Security Infrastructure Council.
  Recognizing the vital role of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in our 
national security and concerned about outdated and deteriorating 
conditions across campus, they assembled a straightforward, multi-year 
plan to bring the campus up to a standard commensurate with its crucial 
function. I am pleased to include in the Record a summary of their plan 
to modernize the Academy's 80-year-old infrastructure as well as a link 
to the Full Speed Ahead Plan in its entirety, which can be found at 
https://wearetheusmma.com/fullspeedahead/.
  Graduates of the USMMA, one of our Nation's five federal service 
academies, make up more than 80 percent of the U.S. Navy Strategic 
Sealift Officer Force. Without these service-committed mariners, the 
Nation would have no assured source of trained, licensed officers to 
crew the vessels which move materiel, fuel and supplies to foreign 
shores in wartime. Without a comprehensive capital improvement plan and 
its timely execution, conditions on the USMMA's Kings Point, New York 
campus will continue to worsen, adversely impacting mission-critical 
training and hindering recruitment of dedicated service-obligated 
midshipmen.
  For far too long, Congress has ignored the infrastructure required to 
provide USMMA midshipmen the specialized education and training they 
need to fulfill their mission. It is now time to make the institution 
worthy of their commitment to serve our Nation.

                Maritime Security Infrastructure Council

           U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Full Speed Ahead Plan


 Full Speed Ahead: A Plan to Address Critical Infrastructure Needs at 
                    the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy

       Background: In January 2021, the Maritime Security 
     Infrastructure Council (MSIC), a group with expertise in 
     major construction project management and concerned about the 
     deterioration of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) 
     infrastructure, developed a comprehensive plan to bring the 
     campus up to the standards necessary to prepare USMMA 
     Midshipmen to lead our Nation's maritime mission in the 21st 
     century.
       The Full Speed Ahead Plan is an intensive 8-year program to 
     execute a decades overdue, comprehensive modernization: new 
     academic buildings, physical readiness/training facilities, 
     midshipmen morale and welfare spaces, parking structures, 
     faculty and senior staff housing, utilities, IT, and campus 
     security upgrades, and renovations of many existing 
     buildings. This plan is adaptable, e.g., it can be adjusted 
     for longer construction timelines and funding schedules, 
     and--importantly--it is intended to be executed while keeping 
     USMMA fully operational throughout construction.
       Previous cost estimates were $611M in January 2021 and 
     $820M in March 2022. The estimated cost when adjusted for 
     inflation has now risen to $1.02B; additional delay will only 
     further increase the cost of this urgently needed 
     modernization.
       The need: With over 80 years in service to our nation, a 
     comprehensive modernization is long overdue if USMMA is to 
     continue producing world-class, service-committed merchant 
     marine officers who are the backbone of the U.S. Navy's 
     Strategic Sealift Officer Force and a crucial element of 
     defense readiness.
       Congress has rightly recognized the necessity of and 
     supported funding modernization projects at the other federal 
     service academies, especially West Point and Annapolis. Long-
     term low funding levels have left the campus under-resourced, 
     and the result is a deteriorating campus that makes 
     attracting a diverse applicant pool and providing state-of-
     the-art mission critical training even more difficult. Many 
     of the facilities date back to the Academy's founding in the 
     1940s and are simply not conducive to the immersive training 
     and demanding coursework expected from our Nation's five 
     service academies.
       Modern IT is nearly nonexistent in several buildings; what 
     is available cannot accommodate even the most basic digital 
     needs of Midshipmen, let alone support the increasingly high-
     tech vessel systems that they must master.
       Aside from minor Midshipmen Barracks repairs in the 2000s, 
     there have been no renovations or upgrades since 1988. Nearly 
     every building on campus has exceeded its life expectancy and 
     now requires replacement or major renovation.
       This is particularly true of the Academy's physical 
     training, leadership readiness, and athletic facilities. 
     Although USMMA was the first federal service academy to admit 
     women in 1974, no additional athletic or training spaces have 
     been provided for female teams in the ensuing 50 years, 
     clearly contrary to the requirements of Title IX. Overall, 
     these limited and outdated facilities are inadequate for 
     Midshipmen to maintain physical readiness standards of the 
     U.S. Navy and other services and adversely impact the 
     recruitment of future Midshipmen. Midshipmen need a purpose-
     built pool, featuring a separate wave pool with high dive/
     jump capabilities in order to accommodate their specific 
     mandatory training needs for rescue and survival at sea.
       The Fix: Our working group of maritime executives, 
     engineers, architects, and construction industry 
     professionals--some USMMA graduates--propose the 
     authorization and funding of a multi-year program of 
     infrastructure replacement and improvement projects.
       The Budget and Timeline Snapshot: We suggest directed 
     funding for foundational design work that will serve as the 
     blueprint for an aggressive eight-year construction and 
     project management program. However, the plan can be readily 
     adapted to meet longer construction timelines and funding 
     schedules, along with any potential project modifications. As 
     of January 2024, the current cost of the plan is $1.02B over 
     eight years.
       The Plan: For decades, concerned stakeholders have 
     unsuccessfully sought to upgrade USMMA's physical plant; this 
     plan reflects much of the quality thinking and hard work that 
     went into earlier plans, which regrettably never came to 
     fruition. This document specifically builds on the input of 
     those earlier planning initiatives.
       This plan details the facilities necessary for the USMMA to 
     preserve its position as the preeminent leader in maritime 
     education in the Nation, today and into the future. It 
     reflects a long overdue acknowledgment that the campus has 
     fallen woefully behind the other four federal service 
     academies and other peer top-tier institutions.
       The plan meets the long-term objectives of the Academy 
     through facilities that will promote modern educational best 
     practices, including globally connected research facilities; 
     engineering powerplant laboratories; 21st century IT-enabled 
     classrooms.
       Support mission critical proficiencies: Standards of 
     Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW) applications 
     laboratories; Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) training pool; 
     Conference and license exam space.
       Promote readiness: Accessible modernized fitness facilities 
     sufficient to enable all Midshipmen to maintain physical 
     readiness standards required of USN Reserve officers; NCAA-
     standard facilities for all athletes; Health and wellness 
     center.
       Facilitate leadership development: Weapons range; enhanced 
     waterfront facilities; band facility.
       Attract a diverse pool of applicants to ensure USMMA 
     enrolls the best and the brightest.
       Provide continuing education and industry engagement 
     facilities: Maritime Center of Excellence for research, 
     innovation, and policy development; MSCE accreditation 
     required post-graduate continuing education opportunities; 
     Maritime industry leadership conference capability.
       Maintain a secure facility and a safe environment: secure 
     campus at a level necessary to protect a federal facility; 
     centralized security/access control at main gate and academy 
     facilities; fencing and monitoring of campus boundaries; 
     cyber-secure, modernized IT network.
       Master Planning Process and Principles: The 82-acre campus 
     is a unique, historically significant property. Our plan is 
     designed to modernize the campus without expanding its 
     current footprint.
       The Education District includes the original 1943 academic 
     buildings, barracks, and

[[Page E190]]

     administrative offices that form the hub of the campus.
       The Waterfront District includes Eldridge Pool, the 
     Memorial Arbors, the Chapel, Yocum Sailing Center, the USCG 
     Station, Samuels Hall and Crowninshield/Cressy Pier.
       The Physical Training and Athletics District includes all 
     the Academy's athletic facilities.
       The Community District encompasses all of the McNulty 
     Campus, including faculty housing and the museum. A second 
     community district south of the Education District includes 
     senior staff housing, the Patten Health Clinic, and the 
     Midshipmen Activities Center.
       Program Cost Summary:
       Construction: Academic Center $116M; Activity Center 
     $42.2M; Aquatic Readiness Center $65.6M; Leadership 
     Development and Readiness Center $133.1M; Parking Structures 
     $50.7M; Federal Maritime Center of Excellence $49.1M; Senior 
     Staff/Faculty Housing $12.2M; Crowninshield Pier Replacement 
     $31.7M; Waterfront Sailing Center $19.2M. New construction 
     subtotal: $519.8M.
       Facility Renovation & Upgrades: Samuels Hall Renovation 
     Completion $8.8M; Campus Security and Waterfront Improvements 
     $28.3M; GIS and Upgrade Academy Utilities $95.4M; Main Gate

                  RECOGNIZING ONA MARIE JUDGE STAINES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHRIS PAPPAS

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ona Marie 
Judge Staines, a New Hampshire woman born in Virginia, who was enslaved 
by George and Martha Washington, and taken by them to Phildelphia 
during Washington's second term as United States president. Ona Judge 
self-emancipated from their household, as the Washingtons were 
preparing to return to Mount Vernon in their semi-annual effort to 
avoid the Pennsylvania law that enabled enslaved people to sue for 
their freedom if they remained in the state for more than six months. 
Recounting her story in 1845 she remarked on her escape, ``Whilst they 
were packing up to go to Virginia, I was packing to go, I didn't know 
where; for I knew that if I went back to Virginia, I should never get 
my liberty . . .''
  During her time in the city, Ona Judge had become acquainted with 
members of Philadelphia's large free Black community who provided her 
contact with a ship captain who would take her north. On May 21, 1796, 
she boarded the ship Nancy, bound for Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 
search of freedom.
  The Washingtons relentlessly pursued her, but Ona Judge found a home 
among Portsmouth's Black community. Washington learned of her 
whereabouts and sent one of his wife's relatives to convince her to 
return. She refused, saying ``I am free now, and choose to remain so.'' 
Rebuffed, the man determined to take her and her child back to Virginia 
by force and admitted his intentions to Senator John Langdon. Whether 
it was Langdon who alerted her to the impending capture, or his trusted 
free Black servant Cyrus Bruce, we do not know for sure. But Ona was 
determined to remain free and fled eight miles from Portsmouth into 
Greenland, New Hampshire, where she lived with her daughters and 
friends John and Phillis Jacks and their family until her death in 
1848.
  Several years before her death, Ona Judge Staines told her story to 
two abolitionist newspapers. The interviewer for the Granite State 
Freeman asked her if she ever regretted her decision, and she replied 
``No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by the 
means.'' Her journey exemplifies the power of determination in the 
search for liberty, embodying our state motto ``Live Free or Die.'' On 
behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional 
District, I commend the bravery of Ona Judge Staines to assert her 
right to freedom at any cost. May her story never be forgotten.

         RECOGNIZING ROBERT LAMBE'S SERVICE TO THE GREAT LAKES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 28, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert Lambe on 
the occasion of his retirement from the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. 
His significant service to the Great Lakes and surrounding communities 
during his lengthy career is worthy of commendation.
  Bob Lambe has been focused on serving and protecting our environment 
throughout his career. He holds a Master of Business Administration 
from the University of Western Ontario and is an Electronic Engineering 
Technology graduate from the Cabot Institute of Applied Arts and 
Technology. Bob had a 35-year career within the Public Service of 
Canada. For 6 years, Bob served as the Regional Director General for 
the Central and Arctic regions. Bob was also appointed as the first 
Executive Director for the Invasive Species Centre in Sault Ste. Marie, 
which focuses on research, mitigation and response planning, and 
rehabilitation efforts to combat invasive species that hurt Canada's 
ecosystems. In these roles, Bob has exhibited a wealth of knowledge and 
experience when it comes to natural resource management, and his true 
passion and dedication for protecting and conserving our aquatic 
ecosystems is clear.
  Most notably, in 2013 Bob Lambe joined the Great Lakes Fishery 
Commission, a binational organization based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
Here he served as executive secretary for over a decade, as well as 
commissioner and chair of the Commission. Bob's work was invaluable, 
and focused on appropriations, infrastructure, and strengthening 
relationships with other organizations. Bob was also a board member for 
the North American Invasive Species Network, and the Canadian Aquatic 
Invasive Species Network. In all these positions, Bob worked tirelessly 
to serve the organizations and their ability to serve the Great Lakes. 
He emphasized the importance of protecting and sustaining fisheries in 
the Great

[[Page E191]]

Lakes Basin and applying the wealth of knowledge he gained from his 
career to improve the commission. During his time with the commission, 
Bob received high accolades and praise, including a Distinguished 
Service Award from the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at 
Michigan State University, for his dedication to conservation and 
facilitation of effective cooperative fisheries management.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bob Lambe for 
his lifetime of public service. His commitment to the Great Lakes 
Fishery Commission has made a lasting change to the conservation 
efforts of this organization and will not soon be forgotten. Throughout 
his career, Bob has remained reliable and genuine in his work to 
protect our environment. I join Bob Lambe's family, friends, and 
colleagues in extending my best wishes to him in retirement.

                     PUBLIC TELEVISION IS IMPORTANT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, this week we are having a public media 
summit in our Nation's Capital, with representatives from independent 
television stations from across the country.
  Thirteen years ago, the prospects were not particularly encouraging. 
We had just had a takeover in the House of Representatives with people 
intent on reducing government spending, and public media was in the 
crosshairs. Today, 13 years later, the Federal funding is still flowing 
at record levels to America's public broadcasters. We noted the 
retirement of the head of America's Public Television Stations, Pat 
Butler, who helped guide us through these difficult times.
  Congress has enacted a new infrastructure investment program for 
public media nearly three times as large as the one it replaced. When 
COVID struck, the economy imploded. Congress provided $250 million in 
emergency financial assistance to America's public media. Our 
partnership for public radio and television includes our State 
governments, as well, who will commit a record $365 million to support 
public media.
  There are hundreds of advocates who will hit Capitol Hill to share 
the strong positive message of public broadcasting. In a way, this 
should be the easiest of lobbying assignments. Public broadcasting is 
the most trusted name in media; 180 million people watch or listen to 
it every week.
  The Senate passed the appropriation out of committee 24-2, at a 
funding level overwhelmingly approved last spring by Congress with the 
agreement with the President to avert a shutdown. It included 149 
Republicans. The benefits are powerful and almost universally 
supported, and it is not just news, but most point out that PBS and NPR 
are where even the critics go when they need to know what is actually 
going on.
  Part of our challenge now is that there are a handful of people who 
are holding the budget hostage, which is unfortunate, because there is 
overwhelming support in the House and the Senate if we are able to see 
our way clear. It is perplexing because funding for public media is 
overwhelmingly supported by rural and small-town America.
  There is always going to be public broadcasting in New York, San 
Francisco, Boston, or even Portland, Oregon, but there will not be as 
much and the programming won't be as good, but it will be there. 
However, that is not the case for rural and small-town America, in the 
mountain States, in the rural Midwest, in Alaska.
  That is why the late Republican dean of the House, Don Young, was 
such a fierce champion for public broadcasting in his State and 
nationally. He knew that it was more important in rural America where 
there are fewer choices, and it is more expensive. Federal support was 
critical.
  News, entertainment, culture, think of where we would be during COVID 
without the public educational component. It is also increasingly 
important for public safety. The network supplied by public 
broadcasting is the emergency communications for natural disasters, for 
efforts in terms of fires and floods. It is a system that we depend 
upon, and it is public broadcasting that provides the backbone. People 
literally depend on it for their lives.
  Let's hope, as the visitors from the public television stations visit 
Capitol Hill, meeting with our staff, providing this information, that 
people are receptive because this is an opportunity for us on a 
bipartisan basis to strengthen the ability of Americans to be able to 
learn, to be able to promote culture, education, and public safety. It 
is the best bargain for the taxpayer dollar, and I hope that we will be 
supportive.

                     STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS SCAM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, last week, President Biden 
announced a plan to cancel $1.2 billion

[[Page H700]]

in Federal student loans for 150,000 borrowers.
  As Americans, we have always followed a simple rule: If you take out 
a loan, you pay back the loan. It is time to call a spade a spade. This 
student loan scam isn't forgiveness; it is an election-year handout to 
President Biden's far-left voters to transfer debt to the American 
taxpayer. This gimmick transfers the burden of the loans from the 
students who took the loans onto every American taxpayer.
  Repaying these loans certainly has no personal benefit to 87 percent 
of taxpayers who don't have student loans and to the 100 million 
Americans who never attended college.
  This program takes advantage of Americans who are already struggling 
to support their families under the weight of President Biden's 
inflation. It is time to send a message to President Biden and his 
administration that we cannot allow hardworking Americans, who have 
kept their word and repaid their personal loans, to be ripped off by 
yet another pandering scheme to the far left.


                           Rare Disease Week

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Rare Disease Week.
  Right now, more than 25 million Americans and their loved ones are 
impacted by over 7,000 conditions which are classified as rare 
diseases.
  Since the Orphan Drug Act was enacted in 1983, more than 600 drugs 
have been developed to combat these illnesses and ultimately save 
lives. Now, because of President Biden's so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act, the environment that has allowed these treatments to develop is 
being threatened.
  This week, I am proud to be working alongside my colleagues to 
advance bipartisan legislation, the ORPHAN Cures Act, which would 
expand the orphan drug exemption for medicines with multiple 
indications involving rare diseases and cancers.
  It is critical that Congress acts to support research and development 
into treatments and therapies that address rare diseases and further 
work to ensure that patients have access to the care and treatment that 
they need.
  As we recognize Rare Disease Week, let's commit to standing with 
patients who are living with rare diseases, including pediatric cancers 
and diseases like cystic fibrosis, classified as rare, but they are not 
rare to the families and the patients who are suffering with them.
  Let's commit to working together to ensure that every patient, 
regardless of the rarity of the condition, receives the support, the 
care, and the treatment that they need.

                 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LARRY MAKOBEN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaLota). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
celebrate the life of Larry Makoben of Bettendorf, Iowa.
  Larry's remarkable work in the Quad Cities was transformative. Over 
the years, Larry was president of the Bettendorf Jaycees and the 
Bettendorf Chamber of Commerce, where he served for many years as an 
Ambassador. He was also a member of the Bettendorf and Quad Cities 
Morning Optimist Club, the Bettendorf Kiwanis Club, and Larry served as 
the district chairman for the Boy Scouts of America. His unwavering 
dedication, leadership, and passion for excellence set a standard that 
will continue to inspire us all.
  As we reflect on Larry's achievements, his military service, and his 
service to our community, let us remember the positive influence he had 
on those around him.
  I offer my deepest condolences to Larry's wife, Carolyn, and his 
family during this difficult time. May we honor Larry by carrying 
forward his spirit of resilience, creativity, and commitment to making 
a difference.


  Zach Bott Named Iowa Wine Growers Association Winemaker of the Year

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
extraordinary achievements of Zach Bott, a winemaker at Fireside Winery 
in Marengo and Ackerman Winery in Amana for being named the 2024 Iowa 
Wine Growers Association Winemaker of the Year.
  In a region known for its rich agricultural history, Zach's 
dedication and passion for winemaking have truly set him apart. Zach 
Bott has not only mastered the art of winemaking but has also become a 
symbol of excellence in the industry. His commitment to producing high-
quality wine reflects the spirit of innovation and hard work that 
defines Iowa's winemaking industry.
  Congratulations to Zach Bott on this well-deserved honor. May his 
success inspire a new generation of winemakers and continue to elevate 
Iowa's presence in the world of wines. Cheers.


       Permanent University of Iowa Athletics Director Beth Goetz

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Beth Goetz, who 
was recently named the permanent athletics director for the University 
of Iowa. She is now the first woman to oversee the university's entire 
athletics program since Christine Grant led the then-separate women's 
athletic department from 1973 to 2000.

  Beth's groundbreaking appointment not only marks a significant 
milestone for women working in athletics, but the promotion also 
reflects Iowa's commitment to excellence and diversity in leadership. 
With an impressive track record and a visionary approach, Beth is ready 
to lead Iowa athletics to new heights. Congratulations, Beth, and Go 
Hawks.


      Heartfelt Gratitude to the Iowa Department of Transportation

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to express my 
heartfelt gratitude to the Iowa Department of Transportation, the city 
crews, the county crews, and all the volunteers who worked tirelessly 
during the recent winter storm in Iowa's First Congressional District.
  With another storm coming in today, their work has been so helpful to 
all Iowans, and to those who are crossing the country on Interstate 80 
or Interstate 35. Their unwavering commitment and dedication ensured 
that our roads were cleared, our sidewalks were usable, our communities 
remained safe, and ensured that our essential services continued 
uninterrupted. It was a challenging and dangerous job to do.
  I extend my deepest gratitude to the women and men who, through their 
hard work, kept our cities running smoothly and our roads safe. Their 
efforts have not gone unnoticed.

                   PRESIDENT BIDEN'S BORDER BRUTALITY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Rose) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, last week our country lost yet another 
innocent soul to President Biden's administration's inexcusable and 
shameful open-border policy when 22-year-old Laken Hope Riley was 
brutally murdered by a Venezuelan citizen who illegally entered our 
country in September 2022.
  Laken Riley was a nursing student at Augusta University's Athens 
campus who was out on a morning run near the intramural fields at the 
University of Georgia. May her soul rest in peace.
  Unfortunately, this is what Americans across the country have come to 
expect since President Biden took office. His administration has 
enacted and implemented numerous open-border policies which directly 
and inevitably result in these sorts of tragedies.
  In addition to this terrible tragedy that occurred in Georgia, local 
authorities in Virginia arrested a 32-year-old Venezuelan migrant in 
connection with the sexual assault of a minor. Just like the murderer 
who allegedly killed Laken Riley, this individual also entered the 
country in September of 2022 after being detained and released by U.S. 
Customs and Border Patrol in El Paso, Texas.
  In our Nation's Capital, Washington, D.C., a man accused of shooting 
three District of Columbia police officers was found to be in our 
country illegally with an active deportation order with Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement. All three of these terrible, completely avoidable 
tragedies occurred in the same calendar month, just a week apart.

                              {time}  1215

  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, pure and simple, these are the consequences 
of

[[Page H701]]

the Biden's administration indefensible open-border policies.
  There is no doubt that President Biden's feckless border policies are 
the direct causes of this once unimaginable level of crime and loss of 
life.
  To make matters worse, just days after both of these immigrants 
entered our country illegally, President Biden, instead of trying to 
secure the border, erroneously stated that the border was actually 
secure and that it was ``not rational'' to deport illegal immigrants 
from Venezuela.
  If deporting illegal immigrants is not rational, then that begs the 
question, Madam Speaker, what is rational? Simply doing nothing but 
keeping the border wide open surely isn't rational.
  As a father of two young children growing up in President Biden's 
United States where every town has become a border town, I fear it is 
only a matter of time until one of these families that I represent in 
middle Tennessee faces the same consequences of the Biden 
administration's open-border policies.
  I pray that day never comes. I also pray the President comes to his 
senses and ends the humanitarian crisis at the southern border that his 
administration's policies have caused.
  The administration has already admitted they have the authority to 
restrict migrants' ability to seek asylum at the border. It is well 
past time that the President used that authority.
  Until then, House Republicans like me will continue sounding the 
alarm and beating the drum to shed light on this administration's open-
border policies and blatant abuse of our immigration laws.
  Border security is national security, and strong borders make for 
strong countries and safe countries.

                    STANDING WITH AMERICA'S FARMERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Miller-Meeks). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, at this very moment, America's dedicated 
farmers and the Nation's entire agricultural community are facing a 
serious threat.
  That threat is the Communist Chinese Party's continued purchasing of 
American farmland. This is a threat that I take very seriously and one 
that I remain committed to fixing.
  Here is the truth: The Chinese Communist Party has absolutely no 
interest in supporting our Nation's food supply.
  It cares only about improving its own bottom line while kneecapping a 
community that has always put food on the tables of families in every 
ZIP Code in America.
  Think about the threat that is being posed to our national security 
as more American farmland is acquired by the Chinese Communist Party.
  My record is crystal clear on standing with farmers, and I have 
recently taken action to confront and expose the Chinese Communist 
Party's covert agenda.
  I have cosponsored H.R. 7131, the AFIDA Improvements Act of 2024, 
legislation that makes serious reforms related to how the United States 
Department of Agriculture shares data on foreign investments in 
agricultural land.
  What is more, I have cosponsored H.R. 809, the Prohibition of 
Agricultural Land for the People's Republic of China Act.
  This legislation requires the President to take necessary actions to 
prohibit the purchase of public or private agricultural real estate 
located in the United States by nonresident aliens, foreign businesses, 
or any agent, trustee, or fiduciary associated with the Government of 
the People's Republic of China.
  Further, under this legislation, individuals or businesses with 
direct ties to the Government of the People's Republic of China will be 
prohibited from certain programs administered by the Secretary of 
Agriculture.
  Madam Speaker, the simple truth is that our Nation's food supply and 
supply chain are better off when American farmers are put first.
  The interests of the Chinese Government should never be put first. 
This threat is one that should not be ignored.
  I have long held that North Carolina's agricultural industry is the 
best that our Nation has to offer. It has always been and will always 
be a force to be reckoned with.
  Last Congress, I was proud to be a recipient of the Friend of the 
Farm Bureau award in recognition of my voting record in support of 
farmers across North Carolina and the Nation.
  These hardworking men, women, and families work tirelessly every day 
to support our Nation. I will always stand with them and push back 
against every attempt to undermine their livelihoods.

                   CONTINUED ACCESS TO FERTILITY CARE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. Mace) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join 
my resolution in regard to IVF. My resolution expresses support for 
continued access to fertility care and assisted reproductive 
technologies such as in vitro fertilization in light of Alabama's court 
ruling last week that has jeopardized access to in vitro fertilization 
and other assisted reproductive technology in the State of Alabama.
  For years now, since 2019, I have been advocating for women's issues 
and women's rights on the issue of contraception, on the issue of 
contraceptives, and on the issue of abortion exceptions, particularly 
for the life of the mother, rape, and incest.
  In 2019, as a State lawmaker, I told my story as a survivor of rape. 
When the State of South Carolina was doing its fetal heartbeat bill, it 
had no exceptions for women who were raped or for girls who were 
victims of incest, and I was frustrated by that argument because very 
few women are actually speaking up about women and about those 
exceptions.
  Ever since then, I have become very passionate about protecting 
women, about protecting their rights, and about protecting access to 
IVF, et cetera.
  Today, I want to point out I have cosponsored legislation and 
resolutions by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as it 
relates to contraception, as it relates to contraceptives, as it 
relates to providing information and protecting IVF, and, yet, not a 
single one of them got criticized for the legislation because they were 
Democrats.
  Yet today, I am trying to work with Members on both sides of the 
aisle together to condemn the ruling in Alabama, to express our 
sentiment and express our support for IV access for women all across 
the country.
  When a Republican does it, it should be equally supported by the 
corporate media, but, apparently, it is not.
  I am urging my colleagues today to get beyond the divisive politics 
and look forward to how we can actually work together because this IVF 
issue shouldn't be Republican, and it shouldn't be Democrat.
  The vast majority of Americans--I dare say almost every single 
American in this country, almost a hundred percent--support efforts to 
protect women's access to IVF.
  I also want to mention, last year I cosponsored H. Res. 345, Debbie 
Wasserman Schultz' resolution, that recognizes that infertility is a 
widespread problem that affects populations of diverse ages, races, 
ethnicities, and genders.
  Madam Speaker, 12 percent of women in the U.S. have difficulty 
getting pregnant or staying pregnant, and 9 percent of men experience 
infertility.
  The resolution acknowledged that infertility is a disease and that 
infertility is not just a women's issue because it impacts men also. 
This is a families' issue.
  The Federal Government has a moral obligation to ensure the 
availability of infertility-related services to all individuals and 
families without barriers such as access, cost, and coverage.
  I remind the press that I also was only one of eight Republicans that 
voted in favor of Kathy Manning's Right to Contraception Act.
  The Greater Access to Contraceptive Options Act ensures women and 
families across the country have a right to obtain and use 
contraceptions. It is a commonsense measure in the case of rape, 
incest, or in order to maintain a healthy and well-functioning body. 
Reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies requires ensuring 
contraceptives are available to couples, women, et cetera.

[[Page H702]]

  Finally, beyond the numbers as it relates to my resolution regarding 
support for IVF, IVF has a genuinely positive impact on individuals, 
families, and communities.
  IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies contribute to the 
birth of over 10 million babies globally every single year. In the 
U.S., 12 percent of women of reproductive age have utilized assisted 
reproductive technology.
  Infertility is a deeply personal and obviously devastating issue. I 
am calling on my colleagues today on both sides of the aisle, 
Republican and Democrat alike, to join me in expressing the sentiment 
in the whole House of Representatives that we are dedicated to 
protecting the American Dream of starting a family by cosponsoring this 
resolution.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  O sovereign Lord, 2 years into this unrelenting conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine, we appeal to You to act in condemnation against the 
unprovoked and the unjustified aggression and the heinous and hateful 
crimes against the Ukrainian people.
  Uphold the cause of justice and defend these men and women who have 
called to You in their need. For they have been a testimony to faith, 
waiting patiently for You, fearing not when evil people have succeeded, 
and never losing heart even as the wicked carry out their schemes.
  Protect them from their enemy but preserve them also from themselves, 
that they would refrain from acting out in anger and responding in 
wrath. In the horror of this interminable war, prevent them from 
resorting to vengeance, deliver them from exercising the very evil they 
are now enduring.
  May all who suffer at the hands of such aggressors be assured that 
You, O Lord, laugh at the wicked for You know their day is coming. 
Though they draw the sword and bend the bow, You, O righteous one, will 
cause their weapons to pierce their own hearts. You will cause their 
strongholds to break.
  Make firm the steps of those who delight in You. Though they may 
stumble, they will not fall, for You, O Lord, will uphold them with 
Your hand.
  In the strength found only in Your name do we pray.
  Amen.

                          BRINGING KAI LI HOME

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. LaLota) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LaLOTA. Madam Speaker, we, the United States Government, must do 
everything in our power to bring my constituent, Kai Li, home from his 
unlawful imprisonment by the Chinese Communist Party.
  Since 2016, Kai Li, of Huntington, New York, has been unjustly 
imprisoned by the Chinese Communist Party.
  In 2016, Kai Li visited Shanghai to mark the first anniversary of his 
mother's death. When he arrived at the airport in Shanghai, Chinese 
Communist Party authorities immediately arrested him on what they 
called espionage charges.
  For months, Kai was held in secret detention without access to legal 
counsel. Almost 2 years later, in July of 2018, in a one-hour secret 
trial, Kai was convicted of espionage.
  This is yet another example of the Chinese Communist Party's long 
history of aggressively targeting and detaining individuals on trumped-
up charges of spying.
  Since coming into office 14 months ago, I have called on the 
administration to do everything in its power to bring Kai Li home to 
his family, including his son, Harrison.

  Soon, I will be introducing legislation to urge this administration 
to prioritize bringing Kai Li home and end his unlawful detainment. We 
must right this wrong and fix a broken situation.


                        police explorers program

  Mr. LaLOTA. Madam Speaker, the Suffolk County Police Department has 
an exciting program to increase interest among teenagers in pursuing a 
career in law enforcement. It is called the Police Explorers.
  Participants in the program must show an interest in a law 
enforcement career, meet minimum academic standards, and have no 
criminal convictions or history.
  The Police Explorers program is a learning-for-life program, which 
provides participants with police training and community service 
experience.
  I had the chance to meet with Sergeant Linda Piotrowski of the 
Suffolk County Police Department in my Hauppauge office, and she 
briefed me on this program.
  We had a great discussion about public safety and how to increase 
awareness among young people interested in a career in law enforcement.
  As the son and grandson of police officers, I am thrilled to see 
efforts to increase law enforcement recruitment numbers and to help 
those interested in a career in law enforcement. Together, we must 
continue to support and back the blue at every opportunity.


                  combating the rise in anti-semitism

  Mr. LaLOTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the disturbing 
rise in anti-Semitism in this country and around the world, especially 
in the months following the October 7 terrorist attacks committed by 
Hamas against the people of Israel.
  Since October 7, America has seen a demonstrable rise in anti-
Semitism on college campuses where students have been harassed and even 
insulted simply for being Jewish.
  Despite their years of elitist rhetoric, talk of safe spaces, and 
feigning how they welcome all cultures, duplicitous liberal college 
presidents have refused to take action to protect these students.
  In America, every student should be free to live and learn without 
fear of harassment or physical violence. America's colleges must do 
better.
  Here in Washington, I am proud to cosponsor several pieces of 
legislation to support Israel, hold Hamas and Iran accountable, and 
condemn anti-Semitism, including H.R. 6090, the Anti-Semitism Awareness 
Act, which would require the Department of Education to clearly define 
anti-Semitism and ensure anti-Semitic hate crimes on college campuses 
are properly investigated and prosecuted.

  (Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Leap Day, which means the folks I 
represent in Tennessee will be subject to an extra day of the 
disastrous economic policies of the Biden administration that have 
resulted in record-high inflation and an unaffordable cost of living.
  Look no further, Mr. Speaker, than a recent report that said December 
was the least affordable month on record to own a home, as home prices 
hit an all-time high.

[[Page H703]]

  December marked the 11th straight month of higher home prices and a 5 
percent increase in prices over the entire year.
  Coupled with higher interest rates, thanks to the Biden 
administration's reckless deficit spending, the American Dream of 
owning a home is quickly evaporating.
  However, Mr. Speaker, I am committed to passing policies that make 
purchasing and owning a home more affordable and lowering the cost of 
living for the average American and the Tennesseans that I represent.

1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 180th 
anniversary of the Dominican Republic's independence.
  This past weekend, the streets in downtown Christiansted, St. Croix, 
and Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, were alive with the spirit of the 
Independence Day Parade, a tradition that has graced our islands for 15 
years and serves as a testament to the rich tapestry of our shared 
heritage.
  The Virgin Islands prides itself on being a melting pot of cultures, 
and the active participation and integration of the Dominican community 
showcase the strength and beauty of that diversity.
  It is inspiring to see members of the Dominican community opening 
businesses, contributing to our economy, and taking on key roles in our 
government as they share their passion and their ideas.
  Those efforts and achievements reinforce the value of cultural 
exchange and mutual respect that are the foundation of our society.
  It is the fabric that weaves our communities together and allows 
every ethnicity and nationality to celebrate their unique culture and 
traditions.
  Here is to many more years of friendship, collaboration, and shared 
prosperity between the Virgin Islands and, indeed, the United States 
and the Dominican Republic.

                             General Leave

  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6544, the Atomic 
Energy Advancement Act. I first thank my colleague and friend, the 
ranking member of the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee, 
for leading this effort with me, Congresswoman Diana DeGette.
  Madam Speaker, this is a package of nuclear bills and is comprised of 
the

[[Page H712]]

work of many members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce on both 
sides of the aisle. I thank them for their work in advancing the use of 
nuclear energy here in the United States.
  The Atomic Energy Advancement Act will advance durable, bipartisan 
policy that will expand nuclear energy and its many benefits for the 
Nation, while maintaining the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's global 
gold standard for safety.
  Our goal is to bring America's nuclear promise back into alignment 
with the goals that Congress established when passing the Atomic Energy 
Act. This ushered in the age of the peaceful use of the atom, 
demonstrating American leadership around the world and the amazing 
benefits of nuclear power.
  The NRC Mission Alignment Act provision in this bill, which I 
authored, does just that. It directs the NRC to update its mission 
statement to include that its licensing and regulation of nuclear 
energy activities will be conducted in a manner that is efficient and 
does not unnecessarily limit the potential of nuclear energy.
  The NRC should not be an impediment but rather a facilitator of 
nuclear advancement in America.
  There are many provisions in this bill that modernize the NRC and 
advance nuclear technology deployment, including American technology 
exports. For example, the bill requires the NRC to provide efficient, 
timely, and predictable reviews; strengthens the NRC workforce to 
address the new technologies coming down the pike; reduces hourly fee 
rates for advanced nuclear reactor licenses; avoids duplicative 
environmental reviews; updates the DOE's nuclear expert reviews; and 
extends the critical liability protections necessary for nuclear 
investment.
  Now more than ever, it is essential that America lead in nuclear 
energy, especially as our adversaries work actively to undercut our 
strength. Russia and China are seeking to dominate the nuclear markets 
and supply chains for these technologies. America can and must continue 
to set the global nuclear standard, and the Atomic Energy Advancement 
Act will ensure that we do.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, as well as all who have had input on this bipartisan 
legislation. I thank them for their work and dedication.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
                                         House of Representatives,


                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,

     Committee on Foreign Affairs, or prejudice that Committee's 
     jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar 
     legislation in the future.
       As you requested, I will include a copy of our exchange of 
     letters in the Committee on Energy and Commerce's report on

     Hon. Frank D. Lucas,
     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Lucas: Thank you for your letter concerning 
     H.R. 6544, the ``Atomic Energy Advancement Act.'' I 
     appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill so 
     that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.
       I agree that your decision to forgo action on this bill 
     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the 
     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, or prejudice 
     that Committee's jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure

                                                            Chair.

  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6544, the Atomic 
Energy Advancement Act. This bill makes important changes to the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure that our Nation will be able to 
license the advanced nuclear reactors that could play a vital role in 
combating the climate crisis.
  H.R. 6544 will ensure that developers of advanced reactors are not 
asked to pay more than their fair share of their licensing costs. It 
will also help create commonsense pathways to site nuclear reactors on 
brownfield sites and sites that already have a nuclear reactor. Most 
importantly, it will do these things while ensuring that nothing about 
the NRC's core mission of safety is compromised.
  Madam Speaker, the legislation will also help the NRC attract and 
retain staff, which is critical since the Commission needs to be at 
full capacity to license the fleet of new reactors that will apply for 
licenses over the next decade.
  This was a particularly important provision championed by Energy, 
Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee Ranking Member DeGette, and I 
am very happy that it was included in this package.
  I also thank Chair Duncan for the bipartisan way in which this 
package of bills was assembled. This is how Congress should always 
work. We held bipartisan oversight hearings, issued a joint request for 
information, had a legislative hearing to solicit feedback on the 
proposals, and eventually moved the legislation through committee, with 
Democrats and Republicans working together every step of the way. As a 
result, the bill before us today is much stronger than the bill that 
was first introduced.
  The bill is certainly not perfect. It is a product of compromise, and 
like all

[[Page H713]]

compromises, no one got everything they wanted. Further compromise will 
be necessary as we work together with the Senate to find a path forward 
to get this bill to the President's desk.
  Madam Speaker, this is a strong bill that will protect communities 
while unlocking our Nation's nuclear potential. It will help lower 
emissions and ensure that new nuclear plants have a place in our 
Nation's energy economy, all while ensuring protection of public health 
and safety. I hope it is something all Members can support.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, Ranking Member Pallone and his staff have 
been very good to work with the majority staff on this bill, and I 
thank them for that.
  Last year, when I was given the opportunity to chair the Energy, 
Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee, Chairwoman Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers and I had a lot of talk about nuclear energy. This is a 
culmination of a lot of that initial discussion.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce.
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
from the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, H.R. 
6544, the Atomic Energy Advancement Act.
  We have worked very hard, and most agree that a robust and growing 
nuclear industry is critical for reducing emissions and providing 
reliable and affordable clean energy to Americans.
  Nuclear energy can help us build durable, economic, and strategic 
relationships around the world, especially as the influence of China 
and Russia in this industry grows. We know our allies are eager for 
American leadership and technology, and our nuclear industry is ready 
to lead.
  The Energy and Commerce Committee has a rich history of plowing the 
hard ground necessary to legislate, coming together on solutions that 
improve people's lives and that make our country stronger and 
prosperous.
  H.R. 6544 continues that leadership, and I am grateful for the 
leadership of the chairman of the subcommittee, Jeff Duncan, as well as 
the ranking member, Diana DeGette, and the ranking member of the full 
committee, Frank Pallone, for working together so that we can move this 
legislation forward, helping to maintain a robust and growing nuclear 
industry, which is vital to delivering reliable, affordable, and clean 
energy to all Americans.
  This much-needed modernization of our regulatory framework will 
restore America's nuclear dominance; encourage innovation; enable 
industry to deploy safe, reliable nuclear energy; and usher in a new 
era of U.S. energy leadership.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support of the Atomic Energy Advancement Act.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), a member of the committee.
  Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership on this important issue as ranking member of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation, in 
particular, the important changes it makes to how we regulate 
commercial fusion energy.
  Last spring, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took an important vote 
to regulate commercial fusion energy under its existing regulatory 
framework--specifically, the byproduct materials framework. This was a 
critical step toward unlocking commercialized fusion energy, and it was 
made possible by a recognition that fusion does not need to be 
regulated the same way as fission.
  Since then, the Congressional Fusion Energy Caucus, which I have the 
honor of co-chairing alongside Representatives  Don Beyer, Jay 
Obernolte, and Chuck Fleischmann, put pen to paper on the Fusion Energy 
Act, which will codify the Commission's decision and provide the fusion 
industry the regulatory certainty that it needs to continue pursuing 
their innovative research and development.

  During consideration of this package in December, we offered the 
Fusion Energy Act as an amendment, which was adopted unanimously and is 
included in this legislation today.
  I cannot overstate the importance of passing this package because 
fusion is the game changer. A future with fusion means thousands of 
good-paying, family-sustaining, clean energy jobs that we will create 
along the way.
  Fusion unlocks a future where energy production is no longer tied to 
access to a resource. It means an endless supply of baseload clean 
energy, without any emissions. It means dictators like Vladimir Putin 
won't be able to manipulate energy markets to suit their needs.
  Madam Speaker, but make no mistake, both our allies and our 
adversaries are racing to unlock fusion energy. The U.K. is investing 
660 million pounds; Germany recently announced a 1-billion-euro 
investment; and China has already invested 1.8 billion in their state-
owned facilities, with plans to massively ramp up over the next decade.
  In China, there is no private industry investment in fusion. It is 
all government-controlled, and that is a huge competitive advantage 
that we have on them.
  What the United States does best is innovate through public-private 
partnerships that leverage Federal research dollars with the work 
happening at cutting-edge startups and businesses across our country.
  One of those companies, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, is located in 
the district I represent. Since its founding roughly 5 years ago, CFS 
has raised more than $2 billion in private investment, employs over 600 
people, and is well on its way to building SPARC, a fusion machine that 
will achieve net energy and demonstrates that producing commercial 
fusion energy in just a few years is possible.
  Madam Speaker, if we are going to beat China to fusion, then it is 
absolutely critical that we provide companies like CFS with the 
regulatory certainty that they need. Passing this bipartisan package 
does just that.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important, 
commonsense legislation that will advance commercial fusion energy.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I agree that with fusion SMR advanced 
nuclear technology, the nuclear renaissance is right before us.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Weber), my good friend.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I am proud that the Energy and Commerce Committee is 
championing nuclear energy, a clean, safe, and reliable energy source 
for which America should be paving the way.
  Going forward, it must be a significant component of America's energy 
profile, and to make that happen, we need to cut the red tape at the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, expediting environmental reviews for 
nuclear reactors.
  Time and time again, the environmental review process takes entirely 
way too long. My bill, the Modernize Nuclear Reactor Environmental 
Reviews Act, is a part of this Atomic Energy Advancement Act. It will 
reduce duplicative efforts and speed up the review process for nuclear 
reactor applications.
  Madam Speaker, let me reiterate: Nuclear is clean and safe and plays 
a critical role in putting reliable as well as dispatchable energy onto 
our grid.
  I am proud to see that Diana DeGette and Frank Pallone and their 
staff are working with us. It is encouraging that we are working across 
the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support this critical bill to 
advance nuclear energy in the United States of America.

                              {time}  1615

  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and 
the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania has a long and proud history of 
developing energy innovation. From the first oil

[[Page H714]]

well in 1859 to leading the way on natural gas development to 
Westinghouse's work developing nuclear energy in the 1950s, the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been a leader in producing the power 
that Americans, and the entire world, rely on to keep their homes warm 
and their refrigerators cold.
  For decades, the United States has been a leader in the development 
of new technologies and innovation with regard to nuclear energy.
  As demands on our Nation's electric grid continue to grow, small 
modular and microreactors are poised to be the next generation of 
clean, safe, and reliable nuclear technology.
  It is vital that these reactors are permitted efficiently in order to 
allow American consumers to utilize the energy they rely on each and 
every day.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the chair of the Subcommittee on Health.
  Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I rise in support today of H.R. 6544, the Atomic Energy Advancement 
Act.
  I represent western Kentucky coal communities, including Muhlenberg, 
McLean, and Ohio Counties. Unfortunately, Washington Democrats' war on 
coal has resulted in the loss of good-paying jobs and key energy 
production for our Commonwealth and our Nation.
  I introduced the Nuclear for Brownfields Site Preparation Act, which 
is included in this package, to ensure that we continue to use 
Kentucky's experienced energy workers to bring back American energy 
independence and ensure our leadership as an energy producer. We have 
an opportunity to repurpose sites, like retired coal facilities, to 
reinstate American energy dominance.
  I am committed to making sure we have affordable, reliable energy 
from a diverse energy portfolio, while empowering communities who 
powered our Nation for generations to help us continue to keep the 
lights on for years to come.
  Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter), who will probably talk about what is going on at 
Plant Vogtle, the newest reactors to have been constructed in our 
lifetime.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  America used to be the leader in nuclear energy. It should be one of 
the key parts of our energy security and the awe of the globe. However, 
we have allowed it to deteriorate and for other countries to take the 
lead on the global stage.
  Instead, Russia and China are building a larger and larger presence 
in global nuclear power. Together, the two account for nearly 70 
percent of reactors under construction or being planned worldwide.
  The United States cannot stand by and allow China and Russia to be 
the standard bearers of nuclear energy. Just imagine the nuclear 
proliferation implications, let alone the economic ones. Don't be 
fooled. This is just another way for China and Russia to exert 
influence and manipulate countries around the globe. We have seen it 
with the Belt and Road Initiative, and with nuclear plants, this means 
decades and decades of developing countries tied to China.
  Thankfully, this doesn't have to be the case. We can have a new 
American nuclear renaissance. This bill, the Atomic Energy Advancement 
Act, will provide important steps to do so.
  We have proved that in the State of Georgia with the two newest 
reactors built in this country in over 30 years.
  This bill includes reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to 
increase licensing efficiency, strengthen our nuclear workforce, make 
advanced nuclear technology more accessible through fee reductions, 
modernize reviews, and other important improvements to how nuclear is 
approached in the U.S.
  I am pleased to have my bill, the Global Nuclear Energy Assessment 
and Cooperation Act, which I introduced along with Representative Scott 
Peters from California, included as a section of this bill.
  This bill will take a multipronged approach to promoting nuclear 
energy around the globe by providing global nuclear energy assessment, 
providing a program for training and sharing of expertise, and provide 
for an International Nuclear Reactor Export and Innovation Branch.
  This will inspire coordination, research, and development for the 
U.S. and our allies, which is extremely important.
  Lastly, it will prohibit the import of nuclear fuel assemblies from 
hostile foreign nations, including Russia and China.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, this will encourage energy 
independence and prevent our country from being reliant on our enemies 
for our nuclear energy needs.
  My hope is that my bill will be just one small part of improving the 
global competition for nuclear energy. This is how we begin to secure a 
safe, reliable energy future for the United States of America and 
democracies across the globe.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  As you have heard today, the Atomic Energy Advancement Act is really 
setting America up to get ready for what is next. What is next is 
advanced nuclear reactors and small modular reactors. As the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts said, the possibility of fusion is very 
exciting.
  There are the industries that could be set up around the nuclear hub 
of these advanced reactors, jobs that will be created, keeping that 
intellectual property here in America, and addressing our supply issues 
for critical components, enriched uranium, the fuel that is necessary 
to make these reactors work. Lessening the Nation's dependence on 
Russia and China for nuclear technology or nuclear fuel just makes 
sense to a lot of folks in America.
  In order to get ready for that nuclear renaissance that I mentioned 
earlier, we have got to make sure that the government agencies, 
specifically the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is truly prepared as 
they move into the 21st century in the advancement of nuclear energy in 
this country.
  We have got friends and allies who are looking to the United States 
to export the technology to help their countries meet their energy 
independence needs, to be cleaner in their energy production, and 
lessen their dependence on foreign adversaries.
  For example, we were in the Czech Republic last spring, and they 
commissioned both small modular reactors and traditional light-water 
reactors. They were looking to the United States. They were looking to 
the NRC. They were looking to America to lead and help them as they 
develop their nuclear technology and their nuclear energy development 
in their countries. Poland was the same way with light-water reactors, 
the future of SMRs.
  I think about what is going on in this country with SMR development. 
I think about what our neighbors in Canada are doing up in Ontario with 
probably the first SMR that will be full-scale brought online. Nuclear 
development is important to the cleaner energy future for America.
  Madam Speaker, I don't have other speakers on this side, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 
6544, the Atomic Energy Advancement Act.
  This bipartisan bill, which passed out of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee in December, includes a number of policies designed to 
facilitate the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies 
while not compromising on safety.
  The bill will ensure that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is up to 
the job and prepared for the potential license applications for new 
reactor designs that are expected to come its way over the next decade.
  Included in this package are provisions co-led by Democratic Members, 
including language that would:

[[Page H715]]

  First, allow the NRC to retain its current workforce and attract new 
talent to license new reactors;
  Second, lower the regulatory costs imposed upon new reactor 
developers so they are only paying for the expenses they are directly 
incurring;
  Third, ease the processes allowing for demonstration reactors at 
Department of Energy sites, sites with critical national security 
infrastructure, and brownfield sites;
  Fourth, make it easier to co-locate new nuclear reactors on sites 
with currently operating reactors; and
  Fifth, allow for DOE to enter into long-term agreements to purchase 
electricity from a new nuclear reactor.
  Now, I would say nuclear energy is a vital source of zero-carbon 
baseload power. It is imperative in our fight against the worsening 
climate crisis that we strengthen the NRC's regulatory processes so the 
agency is prepared to license 21st century reactors in a timely fashion 
that does not compromise on safety or public health. H.R. 6544 will do 
just that.
  Again, I intend to vote for the bill while it is on the floor under 
suspension, and we urge all Members to join us in supporting the 
legislation.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Allen), who represents Augusta, Georgia, where Plant 
Vogtle is.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6544, the 
bipartisan Atomic Energy Advancement Act, which aims to incentivize and 
advance nuclear energy production in the United States.
  An all-of-the-above strategy is critical to reclaiming American 
energy dominance. As the Nation's largest source of clean energy, 
nuclear has a pivotal role to play.
  Included in today's legislation is a bill I sponsored, the Nuclear 
Licensing Efficiency Act, which would improve the licensing review 
process for future nuclear projects by establishing updated procedures 
and timelines for reviewing nuclear licensing applications.
  With the first two nuclear reactors built in over three decades in 
the United States located at Plant Vogtle, in my district, Georgia 12, 
we are leading our Nation's nuclear future. As we saw through the 
construction process, nuclear projects in the U.S. are often bogged 
down by burdensome licensing and permitting processes that result in 
unnecessary delays and cost overruns.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, by modernizing the inefficient procedures 
that hamper our nuclear energy expansion, we can fully embrace the 
reliability of clean, 24/7 nuclear energy.
  I am proud to have my bill as part of this broader, bipartisan Atomic 
Energy Advancement Act to improve our nuclear energy regulatory 
process.
  Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 6544.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I am thankful, once again, for the 
bipartisan nature of this legislation. I thank Ranking Member DeGette 
on the subcommittee and Ranking Member Pallone and their staff for all 
they have done. Let's get this passed. Let's work with our Senate 
colleagues. Let's get something to the President's desk and get 
something signed into law to move the Nation forward.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Madam Speaker, I want to begin by thanking 
the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee Chairman Duncan for 
leading on this issue.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  The Atomic Energy Advancement Act is an urgent and necessary package 
of bipartisan, commonsense reforms that will help unleash the full 
potential of America's commercial nuclear energy.
  According to the Department of Energy, the United States will require 
at least 200 gigawatts of new electric power generation by 2030 to 
replace aging infrastructure and to meet growing energy needs. This 
demand will be impossible to fulfill without federal support for 
nuclear energy.
  The Atomic Energy Advancement Act contains numerous, sensible 
regulatory reforms and market incentives that will empower the nuclear 
industry to provide affordable, resilient, reliable, and responsible 
power for Americans. Among these much-needed provisions are 
requirements that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission commits to 
efficiency and streamlines the licensing of safer and more affordable 
nuclear reactors.
  Right now is the time for America to go all-in on nuclear power.
  This package gives a modern regulatory framework to bring safe, 
clean, and affordable power. It unleashes American innovation, ensuring 
future generations of Americans energy abundance and energy 
independence.
  I look forward to voting in support of this bill, and I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6544, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

     Campus under this section.
       (3) No effect on status of ownership of campus.--Consistent 
     with section 8124 of title 40, United States Code, the 
     transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the Campus under 
     this section does not change the status of the ownership of 
     the Campus by the United States.
       (b) Development and Uses of Campus.--After transfer of 
     administrative jurisdiction over the Campus under this 
     section, the District may develop and use, and permit the 
     development and use of, the Campus for any of the following 
     purposes:
       (1) Stadium purposes, including training facilities, 
     offices, and other structures necessary to support a stadium.
       (2) Commercial and residential development.
       (3) Facilities, open space, and public outdoor 
     opportunities, which may include supporting cultural 
     activities, educational activities, and recreational 
     activities, as such terms are defined in section 3306(a) of 
     title 40, United States Code.
       (4) Such other public purposes for which the Campus was 
     used or approved for use prior to June 1, 1985.
       (5) Demolition purposes to facilitate development and use 
     of the Campus under subparagraphs (1) through (4).
       (c) Specific Requirements Relating to Development and Use 
     of Campus.--The Declaration of Covenants entered into under 
     subsection (a)(1) shall include provisions to require the 
     District to meet the following requirements as a condition of 
     the development and use of the Campus as set forth

[[Page H716]]

     under subsection (b) after transfer of administrative 
     jurisdiction over the Campus under this section:
       (1) The District shall ensure that the development and use 
     does not materially degrade or adversely impact any lands 
     under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, 
     including the restoration of the wetlands south of Kingman 
     Island.
       (2) The District shall designate, develop, operate, and 
     maintain at least 30 percent of the Campus (excluding the 
     riparian area of the Campus as defined in subsection (g)(2)) 
     as the ``Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Park'' as parks and open 
     space to provide land for passive and active outdoor 
     recreation and shall require that portion to be reserved for 
     such purposes for the duration of the transfer.
       (3) The District shall ensure that the development and use 
     provides for improved public access to the Anacostia River 
     and shall not interrupt the Anacostia River Trail.
       (4) The District shall, to the extent necessary, ensure 
     that parking facilities are provided to accommodate the 
     development.
       (5) The District shall provide for adequate public safety 
     and security measures and resources in the planning and 
     ongoing management of the development.
       (6) The District shall carry out measures that, to the 
     greatest extent practicable, will reduce the impact of noise 
     and traffic of the development on surrounding residential 
     areas in the District.
       (7) The District shall operate and maintain the riparian 
     area of the Campus in accordance with subsection (g).
       (8) The District shall ensure that no Member of Congress,

     other official of the Government of the United States or the 
     Government of the District of Columbia shall be admitted to 
     any share or part of any lease entered into by the District 
     in the exercise of the administrative jurisdiction over the 
     Campus transferred under this section, or to any benefit that 
     may arise therefrom, including any contract or agreement 
     made, entered into, or accepted by or on behalf of the 
     District as a result of this section. Nothing in the previous 
     sentence may be construed to apply to a person who is a 
     shareholder or other beneficial owner of any publicly held 
     corporation or other entity, if the lease is for the general 
     benefit of such corporation or other entity.
       (d) Survey.--
       (1) Requiring survey.--As soon as practicable after the 
     date of the enactment of this Act, the District shall conduct 
     a survey of the Campus, which shall determine the exact 
     acreage and legal description of the Campus by a boundary 
     survey prepared by a qualified Federally-, State-, or 
     District-licensed surveyor who is approved by the Secretary.
       (2) Submission to congress.--Upon completion, the survey 
     conducted under paragraph (1) shall be submitted to--
       (A) the Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the 
     Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
     Representatives; and
       (B) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
     Affairs and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of 
     the Senate.
       (3) Incorporation in declaration of covenants for 
     transfer.--The survey conducted under paragraph (1) shall be 
     incorporated in the Declaration of Covenants entered into 
     under subsection (a)(1).
       (4) Availability of survey and map for public inspection.--
     The survey conducted under paragraph (1), together with the 
     map of the Campus referred to in subsection (m), shall be 
     kept on file and available for public inspection in the 
     appropriate offices of the Secretary.
       (e) Memorandum of Understanding.--As a condition of the 
     development and use of the Campus after transfer of 
     administrative jurisdiction over the Campus under this 
     section, the Secretary and the District shall enter into a 
     memorandum of understanding to determine an allocation of the 
     costs of carrying out all responsibilities of the United 
     States and the District with respect to the Campus under the 
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Solid 
     Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), including any 
     costs of any response action with respect to any 
     contamination present on the Campus.
       (f) Costs.--
       (1) Costs of transfer.--The District shall be responsible 
     for payment of any costs of carrying out the transfer of 
     administrative jurisdiction over the Campus under this 
     section, including--
       (A) any costs of carrying out the survey under subsection 
     (d); and
       (B) any costs of carrying out any environmental analysis 
     required under Federal law.
       (2) Costs after transfer.--Except as provided under the 
     memorandum of understanding entered into under subsection 
     (e), the Secretary shall not be responsible for payment of 
     any costs or expenses that are incurred by the District or 
     any other party (other than the United States) associated 
     with the Campus after the transfer of administrative 
     jurisdiction under this section.
       (g) Special Rules for Riparian Area.--
       (1) Restriction on development and use.--The Declaration of 
     Covenants entered into under subsection (a)(1) shall include 
     provisions to ensure that the riparian area of the Campus may 
     not be developed or used for any purposes other than the 
     continuing maintenance of any development, use, or 
     infrastructure (including roads and pathways) existing at the 
     time of the execution of the transfer of administrative 
     jurisdiction over the Campus under this section.
       (2) Riparian area of the campus defined.--In this 
     subsection, the term ``riparian area of the Campus'' means 
     the area designated in the map referred to in subsection (m) 
     as ``Riparian Area (Area F)''.
       (h) Prohibiting Use of Federal Funds for Stadium.--The 
     Declaration of Covenants entered into under subsection (a)(1) 
     shall include provisions to ensure that the District may not 
     use Federal funds for stadium purposes on the Campus, 
     including training facilities, offices, and other structures 
     necessary to support a stadium.
       (i) Term.--The transfer of administrative jurisdiction over 
     the Campus under this section shall be in effect for a term 
     of not less than 99 years, and may be renewed for subsequent 
     periods agreed to by the Secretary and the District.
       (j) Reversion of Administrative Jurisdiction.--
       (1) Grounds for reversion.--The Declaration of Covenants 
     entered into under subsection (a)(1) shall include provisions 
     stating that administrative jurisdiction over the Campus 
     transferred under this section shall revert to the Secretary 
     if each of the following occurs:
       (A) The terms and conditions of the Declaration of 
     Covenants have not been complied with, as reasonably 
     determined by the Secretary.
       (B) Such noncompliance has not been corrected within 90 
     days after written notice of such noncompliance has been 
     received by the District. Such noncompliance shall be treated 
     as corrected if the District and the Secretary enter into an 
     agreement that the Secretary finds adequate to ensure that 
     the Campus will be developed and used in a manner consistent 
     with the purposes referred to in subsection (b).
       (2) Timing.--The Secretary may not seek the reversion of 
     administrative jurisdiction over the Campus under this 
     subsection before the expiration of 90 days after the date on 
     which written notice of the alleged violation is received by

     Secretary's intention for administrative jurisdiction over 
     the Campus to revert to the Secretary.
       (3) Cost of rehabilitating property.--The Declaration of 
     Covenants entered into under subsection (a)(1) shall include 
     provisions requiring the District to bear the actual cost of 
     removing structures from or rehabilitating the Campus if 
     administrative jurisdiction over the Campus reverts to the 
     Secretary under this subsection.
       (k) Rule of Construction Related to the Applicability to 
     the Administrative Jurisdiction Transfer.--Nothing in this 
     section may be construed to affect or limit the application 
     of or obligation to comply with the Comprehensive 
     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
     1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Solid Waste Disposal 
     Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).
       (l) Conforming Amendment; Termination of Existing Lease.--
     Effective on the date of the transfer of administrative 
     jurisdiction over the Campus under this section--
       (1) the District of Columbia Stadium Act of 1957 (sec. 3-
     321 et seq., D.C. Official Code) is repealed; and
       (2) the lease dated January 14, 1988, between the United 
     States and the District for the use of the Campus, as 
     authorized by section 7(b)(1)(B) of such Act (sec. 3-
     326(b)(1)(B), D.C. Official Code), is terminated.
       (m) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``Robert F. Kennedy 
     Memorial Stadium Campus'' means the approximately 174 acres 
     of Federal land as generally depicted on the map entitled 
     ``Anacostia Park, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus - 
     Transfer of Administrative Jurisdiction'', numbered 831/
     189,767, and dated January 2024.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Weber of Texas). Pursuant to the rule, 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy) and the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on the measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.

                              {time}  1630

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4984, a bill that will provide 
economic opportunities to an area of our Nation's Capital in dire need 
of revitalization.
  The bill transfers administrative jurisdiction over the Robert F. 
Kennedy Memorial Stadium campus from our National Park Service to the 
District of Columbia.

[[Page H717]]

  Under H.R. 4984, the Federal Government will retain ownership of the 
land while the District of Columbia manages the development, costs, and 
the use of the land.
  Transferring administrative jurisdiction over property is a unique 
tool for the Congress, which allows the Federal Government to retain 
title to lands while the district assumes the responsibilities of 
administration and maintenance.
  This tool has already been used multiple times to great effect in our 
Nation's Capital.
  Under the current law granting D.C. a 99-year lease of land, the 
District cannot engage in any commercial or residential development of 
the land. With the lease set to expire in 2038, there are few options 
for future use of the property without congressional action.
  This status quo is untenable.
  H.R. 4984 fixes this problem by allowing stadium purposes, 
recreational purposes, and residential and commercial development. This 
allows the District of Columbia to revitalize this site, turning what 
was once a blight on our Nation's Capital into a thriving area of 
commerce and community.
  Importantly, the bill also imposes any remediation or environmental 
costs onto the District of Columbia, saving taxpayer dollars that would 
otherwise be spent by the National Park Service.
  As Congress continues to carry out its oversight duties over our 
Nation's Capital, this bipartisan bill will help create jobs and 
improve our great Capital City.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan bill. This bill would 
allow the District of Columbia to transform the RFK Stadium campus, 174 
acres of underutilized Federal land in D.C. that primarily consists of 
parking lots, sports fields, and a long-vacant stadium in the process 
of being demolished, into a thriving mixed-use development.
  The National Capital Planning Commission, the central planning agency 
for the Federal Government in the District of Columbia, has long called 
for the revitalization of the campus, and the Department of the 
Interior testified in support of the goals of this bill.
  During my tenure, Congress has passed several bipartisan bills to 
transform underutilized land in D.C. into thriving mixed-use 
developments, including The Yards on the southeast waterfront and The 
Wharf on the southwest waterfront. Reservation 13, 67 acres next to the 
RFK campus, is now being transformed into a mixed-use development.
  Since 1988, D.C. has leased, without consideration, the RFK Stadium 
campus from the Department of the Interior. The lease only permits D.C. 
to use the campus for recreation, a stadium, and open space. The lease 
expires in 2038.
  This bill would give D.C. administrative jurisdiction over the campus 
for at least 99 years and permit D.C. to use the campus for commercial 
and residential development, recreation, a stadium, parks, and open 
space.
  This bill would require D.C. to preserve 30 percent of the campus for 
parks and open space, and prohibit D.C. from building along the 
waterfront.
  This bill is a win-win for the Federal and D.C. Governments. As the 
Department of the Interior testified, this bill would allow D.C. to 
transform the campus from ``acres of asphalt to a complex focused on 
community sports, recreation, park space, and community amenities'' and 
would ``guarantee public access to a sizable amount of park land and 
outdoor recreation areas.''
  At the same time, this bill would allow D.C. to create a mixed-use 
development and to generate significant revenue for D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Comer for his leadership and 
partnership on this bill, and I also thank Chairman Westerman and 
Ranking Member Grijalva for their work on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Comer), the sponsor of the bill and the great chairman of 
the Committee on Oversight and Accountability.
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Langworthy) for yielding, and I thank my cosponsor, the gentlewoman 
from Washington, D.C., (Ms. Norton).
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4984, which repurposes 
approximately 174 acres of unused Federal land in Washington, D.C.
  Despite its long history and importance to D.C. residents, the Robert 
F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium campus in southeast D.C. has been abandoned 
to become unused parking lots, open fields, and a deteriorating stadium 
that is being demolished.
  The campus is currently under a lease that requires the land to be 
used for stadium purposes, recreational purposes, or other public 
purposes. Under current law, the campus cannot be used for commercial 
or residential development.
  Absent congressional action, this land in our Nation's Capital will 
remain unused with ongoing maintenance costs and environmental 
liabilities remaining the full responsibility of the National Park 
Service--an ongoing burden for the American taxpayer.
  My bill, H.R. 4984, will change that.
  The bill transfers administrative jurisdiction from the National Park 
Service to Washington, D.C., while preserving the Federal Government's 
ownership of the land. This allows Washington, D.C., to use the land 
for stadium purposes, commercial and residential development, 
recreational facilities, open spaces, or additional public purposes.
  However, D.C. may not use Federal funds for any potential future 
development of a sports stadium. The bill enables D.C. to transform the 
unused RFK campus into stores, restaurants, office buildings, and 
apartment complexes.
  This economic development will help revitalize the RFK stadium 
campus, creating new jobs and tax revenue for the District's residents.
  Let me be clear. Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee the 
Nation's Capital City. We have diligently exercised this role by 
holding numerous oversight hearings in the Oversight Committee this 
Congress with the Mayor of D.C., and the D.C. City Council.
  We have also successfully blocked, in bipartisan fashion with the 
President's support, the city council's ill-advised criminal reform 
legislation from going into effect last year--the first law of the 
118th Congress.
  We will continue looking for legislative opportunities to return 
order to the District by addressing the rising crime crises, returning 
Federal workers to their offices in the District to contribute to the 
local economy, and seeking ways to bolster the educational system.
  The D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act 
also represents Congress doing its job to oversee the District by 
authorizing the best utilization of area land to help the city thrive.
  We should want this for our Nation's Capital City--a home to the 
taxpayer's Federal workforce and a city that hosts millions of American 
visitors and global tourists each year.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my committee colleague, Congresswoman Eleanor 
Holmes Norton, for working with me to write this smart, bipartisan 
legislation. I thank the Natural Resource chairman, Mr. Westerman, 
Ranking Member Grijalva, and their staff, for working with my staff to 
write the improved bill we are considering today.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill so 
that we can help revitalize our Nation's Capital.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Clyburn).
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4984, the D.C. 
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act.
  Just 2 miles from Capitol Hill, the RFK Stadium was a prime sports 
and entertainment venue for almost 50 years. Today, the stadium and the 
land that surrounds it sits vacant on the shore of the Anacostia River.
  This long-awaited bill would permit the District of Columbia to 
revitalize the underused Federal lands of the

[[Page H718]]

RFK Stadium, enriching the culture of our Nation's Capital and making 
good on our responsibility to be good stewards of the land for future 
generations.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing the plans that Mayor Bowser and 
the D.C. leaders are developing to make good use of the space and 
better meet the needs of the local community.
  I acknowledge and thank the tireless advocacy of our colleague, 
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, on this issue, and I applaud the 
bipartisan collaboration that made this legislation possible.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this timely legislation.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), chairman of the Committee on Natural 
Resources.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4984, 
which is bipartisan legislation that I am cosponsoring to allow 
development of the RFK Memorial Stadium campus in the heart of 
Washington, D.C.
  As a former football player at the University of Arkansas, I know the 
powerful ways that sports can bring communities and even States 
together.
  The current RFK Memorial Stadium, located just down the road from the 
Capitol, has had a long and complex history but is now decrepit and 
falling apart. The legislation before us today will allow D.C. to mark 
the end of decades of legal limbo and the start of an age of economic 
revitalization.
  Under the bill, the National Park Service will no longer have to 
maintain and operate the campus, freeing up finite resources to focus 
on their deferred maintenance backlog. In turn, D.C. will be able to 
revitalize this area and create thousands of jobs with new commercial, 
residential, and recreational facilities. This can serve as a model 
going forward for other communities, particularly those with large 
footprints of Federal land, and represents a win-win for both the 
Federal Government and D.C.

  I would take a moment to clarify the intent of Congress with respect 
to this legislation and the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.
  Over the course of several months of bipartisan negotiations that 
involved the Natural Resources Committee, the Oversight and 
Accountability Committee, as well as the city of D.C., and the National 
Park Service, several improvements were made to the bill. During these 
negotiations, we reached a bipartisan consensus that after this bill 
passes, the National Park Service will conduct a NEPA analysis on the 
transfer of administrative jurisdiction itself. After the transfer, 
NEPA will no longer apply to D.C.'s development and use of the site 
because those activities will not be considered major Federal actions.
  This follows decades of precedent with previous administrative 
jurisdiction transfers, as well as technical assistance and advice 
provided by the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service 
also provided several examples of instances in which the agency 
transferred administrative jurisdiction of land to D.C., including as 
recently as 2022. In none of these instances did NEPA apply after the 
transfer of administrative jurisdiction.
  Mr. Speaker, the examples below were provided by the National Park 
Service (NPS) to the House Committee on Natural Resources during the 
consideration of amendments to H.R. 4984 of instances in which NPS 
transferred administrative jurisdiction of NPS lands within the 
District of Columbia. According to NPS, ``in executing each transfer, 
the NPS complied with all applicable laws, including the National 
Environmental Policy Act. After transfer of administrative jurisdiction 
under this authority, the District of Columbia assumed the management 
and legal responsibilities for the properties.''
     1. 2010 transfer of approximately 15 acres in the northern 
         section of Fort Dupont Park
       Prior to the transfer, NPS issued a finding of no 
     significant impact (FONSI), which stated: ``After the 
     transfer of jurisdiction, the property will be the 
     responsibility of the District since it will no longer be 
     managed by NPS and will no longer be a part of Fort Dupont 
     Park, and District environmental standards will apply.''
     2. 2014 transfer of a portion (Reservation 520) of Fort 
         Lincoln
       Prior to the transfer, NPS issued a finding of no 
     significant impact (FONSI), which stated: ``After the land 
     transfer, the property would no longer be owned by the NPS 
     and would be the responsibility of the District. 
     Consequently, the District's environmental standards would 
     apply.''

     project ID=44032& documentID=100579
     3. 2022 transfer of another portion (Reservation 405) of Fort 
         Dupont Park
       Prior to the transfer, NPS issued a decision form finding 
     that the transfer was categorically excluded from further 
     analysis under NEPA.

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, because there was a clear consensus and 
prior historical evidence demonstrating that NEPA would not apply to 
the development of the campus after the administrative jurisdiction 
transfer, the legislative text did not include superfluous savings 
clauses regarding NEPA's applicability.
  In addition to this, it is my hope that both D.C. and the Department 
of the Interior will abide by Congress' 6-month timeframe provided in 
the legislation to reach all necessary agreements and complete the 
transfer.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize the hard work 
and collaboration of Chairman Comer, Delegate Holmes Norton, and the 
entire staff of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability.
  I would also thank Ranking Member Grijalva and his team, the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, and the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee for their assistance in getting this legislation to the floor 
today.
  Finally, I would recognize several people without whom this 
legislation would not be possible: Beverly Perry, Tara Hupman, Jerry 
Couri, and Lisa Pittman. From the House Natural Resources Committee 
staff, I thank Aniela Butler, Brandon Miller, Colen Morrow, and Taylor 
Wiseman.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation.

                              {time}  1645

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from the District for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4984, the D.C. Robert F. 
Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act.
  This legislation presents an opportunity to revitalize the RFK 
Stadium Campus, a historic site that has served as a cornerstone of our 
Nation's Capital sporting legacy for over five decades. However, over 
the past two decades, the campus has sadly remained underutilized due 
to outdated statutory restrictions.
  These restrictions have limited the use of the RFK campus to stadium 
purposes only, leading to a gradual decline and erosion. This 
legislation focuses on transforming the RFK campus into a mixed-use 
site, which will create thousands of jobs.
  Additionally, it ensures that District residents gain direct access 
to premium recreational opportunities, including green spaces and 
scenic walking trails along the riverfront.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
critical legislation.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland.
  Mr. IVEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4984, the D.C. Robert F. 
Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act.
  Like other members of the Maryland delegation, I believe Prince 
George's County and Maryland should be able to compete on a level 
playing field to keep the Washington Commanders, but this bill would 
give an unfair advantage to D.C. It is most certainly not a level 
playing field when one interested jurisdiction receives a free transfer 
of Federal Government-subsidized land.
  I am not opposed to D.C. bidding to be the new home of the Washington 
Commanders, but its pursuit of the Commanders should be no different 
than its efforts to compete with Virginia for the Wizards and Capitals.
  This is also a bad deal for Federal taxpayers. This bill transfers 
control over Federal Government property at no apparent cost to the 
District of Columbia so that private ownership can

[[Page H719]]

build a football stadium. This is not a District of Columbia home rule 
issue. This is no different than any other city or State competing for 
a sports franchise or stadium, no different than the State of New 
Jersey competing with the State of New York for the Jets or the Giants.
  I also do not object to the redevelopment or renovation of the 
current RFK campus. I think it would be outstanding to have new 
housing, retail use, and park space there. As a matter of fact, I live 
near the stadium and drive by it every day, but I do not believe a 
cost-free land transfer largely for stadium purposes provides the best 
opportunity to achieve these goals.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to 
respond to the comments from my friend from Maryland.
  The National Park Service has a maintenance backlog of $23 billion, 
including $2 billion in the District of Columbia alone. The National 
Park Service does not have the money to transform the RFK Stadium site 
from acres of asphalt into parks or mixed uses.
  There is precedent for Congress giving title to or administration 
jurisdiction over Federal land to States and other jurisdictions for no 
consideration. We do not have to look far for examples. Let's look at 
two of the many examples in D.C.
  First, section 8124 of title 40 of the U.S. Code has long permitted 
the Federal Government to transfer administrative jurisdiction over 
Federal land in D.C. to the D.C. government for no consideration. 
Second, in 1986, Congress directed the Department of the Interior to 
enter into a 50-year lease with D.C. for the RFK Stadium site for no 
consideration.
  While it is true that H.R. 4984 does not require D.C. to pay the 
Federal Government for administrative jurisdiction over the RFK Stadium 
site, it is expected D.C. will spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars transforming the site from acres of asphalt into mixed-use 
development.

  This bill would not require a stadium to be built at the site. 
Whether to build a stadium would be a decision for the elected D.C. 
government. Several members of the D.C. Council have expressed 
opposition to a new football stadium at the site.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial 
Stadium Campus Revitalization Act will allow D.C. to develop the vacant 
RFK Stadium site.
  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that 
will promote economic growth and revitalization for Southeast D.C.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, while Chairman Comer and I often have 
plenty to disagree on, today I join him and Delegate Norton to rise in 
support of H.R. 4984, the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium 
Campus Revitalization Act.
  This bipartisan bill will allow the District of Columbia to 
reenergize Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium campus and redevelop the 
174 acres of underutilized federal land into a new stadium, additional 
housing units, and green spaces.
  As a result, these developments will spur economic growth, improve 
the surrounding infrastructure, and substantially transform the 
neighborhood.
  H.R. 4984 represents the fight to protect and expand Home Rule.
  As a former local government official having served on the Fairfax 
County Board of Supervisors for 14 years, including five as chairman 
and as a former chairman of the Council of Governments I have 
consistently supported autonomy for the District.
  Congress must do the same to uphold the will of thousands of 
constituents and civil servants who live and work in the District.
  Let me remind my colleagues of what my fellow Virginian, James 
Madison, said in the Federalist Papers, Number 43, with respect to the 
intent of the Congressional authority.
  In referring to the residents of this federal District, Madison said 
``they will have had their voice in the election of the government 
which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal legislature 
for local purposes.''
  There is no more basic exercise of municipal authority than planning 
critical investments for the community.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4984, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

      SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN OPPORTUNITIES IN SMALL BUSINESS ACT

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 3511) to amend the Small Business Act to require 
training on increasing contract awards to small business concerns owned 
and controlled by service-disabled veterans, and for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 3511

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Service-Disabled Veteran 
     Opportunities in Small Business Act''.

     SEC. 2. TRAINING ON INCREASING CONTRACT AWARDS TO SMALL 
                   BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY 
                   SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS.

       Section 36 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657f) is 
     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
       ``(j) Training on Increasing Contract Awards to Small 
     Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Service-Disabled 
     Veterans.--
       ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with 
     the Office of Veterans Business Development, shall provide to 
     covered employees at each Federal agency that has not met the 
     goal established under section 15(g)(1)(A)(ii) training on 
     how to increase the number of contracts awarded to small 
     business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled 
     veterans.
       ``(2) Guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation 
     with the Office of Veterans Business Development, shall issue 
     guidance and best practices on increasing the number of 
     contracts awarded to small businesses owned and controlled by 
     service disabled veterans for Federal agencies to which the 
     goal established under section 15(g)(1)(A)(ii) applies.
       ``(3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the 
     Administration shall submit to Congress a report detailing, 
     for the fiscal year covered by the report--
       ``(A) a list of each Federal agency that failed to meet the 
     goal established under section 15(g)(1)(A)(ii);
       ``(B) the number of trainings provided to each Federal 
     agency described in paragraph (1); and
       ``(C) an overview of the content included in such training 
     sessions.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this is the first of eight bills from 
the Committee on Small Business that we will

[[Page H720]]

be considering today. That goes to show that the Committee on Small 
Business is a committee that gets things done, and I hope our Senate 
counterparts follow our lead to get these bills to the President's 
desk.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3511, the Service-
Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small Business Act, which is 
sponsored by my good friend, Representative LaLota, from the great 
State of New York.
  H.R. 3511 builds on this Congress' dedication to America's veterans. 
Our country asks a lot from our brave servicemen and -women. Therefore, 
we must support them when they return to civilian life and ensure that 
they have a fair shot to succeed back home.
  That is why this bill is critical to ensuring that our veterans are 
supported as entrepreneurs. The Federal Government is the largest 
consumer in the world, and each year, these agencies have a goal to 
spend a portion of their contracts with small businesses owned by 
service-disabled veterans.
  In last year's NDAA, Congress raised the spending goal to 5 percent 
of all contracting dollars. Unfortunately, not every Federal agency has 
met its commitment to the men and women who bravely served our country. 
H.R. 3511 would remedy this by requiring the Small Business 
Administration to help failing agencies improve their inclusion of 
service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Our veterans deserve 
to have every chance to succeed in the Federal contracting space.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 3511, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote for this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, today we are considering eight bills, six sponsored by 
Republicans and two by Democrats.
  I look forward to working with the chairman to bring the additional 
five Democratic bills to the floor that were unanimously approved by 
the committee in a timely manner.
  I thank my colleagues, Representatives LaLota and McGovern, for their 
work to bring this bill to the floor today.
  In fiscal year 2022, Federal agencies awarded 4.57 percent of 
contract dollars and a record of just over $28 billion to service-
disabled veteran-owned small businesses, but this number does not tell 
the whole story.
  Every year, a handful of agencies do not meet their individual agency 
goals, showing that there is more that can be done. This legislation 
will require SBA to issue guidance and to provide training for agencies 
when they come up short. It is also important to highlight that 
Congress has raised the service-disabled veteran-owned small 
businesses' goal to 5 percent of Federal contracting dollars moving 
forward, so additional guidance and training will be timely.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota).
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams for yielding, for 
his leadership in the Committee on Small Business, and most importantly 
for recognizing the importance of this legislation and its importance 
to the veterans community.
  Mr. Speaker, America owes a great debt of gratitude to our service-
disabled veterans. Those who have served our Nation in uniform deserve 
our utmost thanks, support, and respect. They put our great country 
before themselves.
  As service-disabled veterans transition into civilian life and some 
look to enter the government contracting space, Congress must identify 
and implement ways to make that transition easier. My bipartisan bill 
does just that. The Service-Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small 
Business Act will provide greater opportunities to our Nation's 
disabled veterans by increasing government contracting opportunities 
for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.
  Currently, Federal agencies are required to contract with service-
disabled veteran-owned small businesses for at least 5 percent of 
contracts awarded, yet the prior lower standard, 3 percent for all, 
wasn't even being met by many agencies.
  My legislation will help solve that problem by requiring the Office 
of Veterans Business Development and the Small Business Administrator 
to provide training to Federal agency officials who fall below their 
procurement goals and issue guidance on best practices to increase the 
number of contracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to 
support the Service-Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small Business 
Act.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey), the ranking member of the 
Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development Subcommittee.

                              {time}  1700

  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3511, the 
Service-Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small Business Act, which I 
am proud to lead with Representative LaLota.
  I am grateful for his partnership, and I am grateful that the bill is 
on the floor today. I will echo the remarks of my colleague, Mr. 
LaLota. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who have 
put on the uniform who were willing to fight for us and, of course, 
were injured in their service. It is up to us to support our veterans 
coming out of the military as much as we support them going in, 
especially those who return with the wounds from their service, both 
visible and invisible.
  So many veterans come home looking for ways to continue serving their 
communities, including by starting small businesses, and the Small 
Business Administration does a great job of connecting veteran and 
disabled veteran entrepreneurs to critical resources they need to start 
businesses, but the Federal Government must do more to ensure all 
veteran entrepreneurs have the tools and opportunities they need for 
their new businesses to thrive.
  For disabled veteran entrepreneurs, opportunity can come in the form 
of sole-source or set-aside contracts, but Federal agencies all too 
often fail to meet their service-disabled vet contracting goals.
  This bill requires the SBA to issue guidance to other Federal 
agencies to better meet the contracting goals for service-disabled 
veteran-owned small businesses and it would additionally require the 
SBA to provide training to agencies that fail to meet these goals.
  If the agencies fail to meet their contracting goals, then this bill 
requires a report to Congress detailing which agencies haven't met 
their goals so we can better understand what works, what doesn't, and 
what we can do to continue improving business opportunities for 
service-disabled veteran businessowners. We shouldn't stop until we are 
delivering on all of our promises.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good bipartisan 
legislation and look forward to its passage today.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing.
  Mr. Speaker, the Federal procurement goals are one way that Congress 
helps to ensure that small business government contractors can enter, 
compete, and remain in the Federal marketplace and that they receive a 
fair share of contracting dollars when doing so.
  This bill will provide agencies with additional tools and training to 
maximize awards to firms owned by service-disabled veterans and meet 
their small business goals.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of my colleagues on this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 
legislation that Mr. McGarvey and Mr. LaLota did a great job on, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Meuser). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House

[[Page H721]]

suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3511.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                        DOE AND SBA RESEARCH ACT

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and

development activities, and for other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.

                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4669, the DOE and SBA 
Research Act, sponsored by my good friend, Representative LaLota, from 
the great State of New York.
  Our national laboratories provide some of the most cutting-edge 
scientific research initiated by the U.S. Government. The 17 national 
labs across the country help ensure we remain world leaders in a 
variety of disciplines, including our Nation's self-defense.
  This legislation will ensure that the great work of our national labs 
and SBA are ensuring small businesses can play a part in these crucial 
activities. Small businesses play an important role in American 
innovation. The Committee on Small Business has heard countless 
testimonies from entrepreneurs who have found inefficiencies in many 
different industries and have since gone to work fixing these problems.
  This is very similar to the work of our national labs as this bill, 
establishing a memorandum of understanding, will prove mutually 
beneficial to both parties.
  The DOE and SBA Research Act is vital to increasing the opportunities 
that innovative small businesses must work with some of the most 
innovative federally funded research organizations in the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 4669, and I reserve the balance of my time.
         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, 
           and Technology
                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2023.
     Hon. Roger Williams,
     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Williams: I am writing concerning H.R. 4669, 
     the ``DOE and SBA Research Act'', which was referred 
     primarily to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, 
     with an additional referral to the Committee on Small 
     Business.
       H.R. 4669 contains provisions within the Committee on 
     Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a 
     result of your having consulted with the Committee and in 
     order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the 
     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego 
     action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our 
     mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or 
     alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, 
     and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, 
     or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject 
     matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.
       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming 
     this understanding, and would request that you include a copy 
     of this letter and your response in in the Congressional 
     Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you 
     in advance for your cooperation.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Frank D. Lucas,
     Chairman.

                                  Committee on Small Business,

                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2023.
     Hon. Frank Lucas,
     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House 
         of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Lucas: Thank you for your letter regarding 
     H.R. 4669, the DOE and SBA Research Act. I appreciate your 
     willingness to work cooperatively to ensure that H.R. 4669 is 
     considered expeditiously before the House of Representatives.
       I recognize that this bill contains provisions that fall 
     within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, 
     and Technology. I also acknowledge that your Committee's 
     decision to forgo consideration would not prejudice your 
     Committee regarding the appointment of conferees, to any 
     future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters 
     contained in the bill, or to similar legislation falling 
     under your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, 
     should a conference on this bill become necessary, I would 
     support your request to have members of the Committee on 
     Science, Space, and Technology represented on the conference 
     committee.
       I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included the 
     Congressional Record during consideration on the House floor. 
     Thank you again, I appreciate your cooperation regarding this 
     legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you 
     as this measure moves through the legislative process.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Roger Williams,
                                                         Chairman.

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4669, as amended.
  This legislation would allow SBA and the Department of Energy to 
enter into an MOU to formalize the research and

[[Page H722]]

development activities that are currently under way. Investments in R&D 
are critical to providing high-paying jobs for Americans, increasing 
small business innovation, and ensuring our country remains 
competitive.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LaLota and Mr. Thanedar for their bipartisan 
work, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota).
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams for yielding and 
for his leadership on the Small Business Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of my bill, the bipartisan 
DOE and SBA Research Act.
  The DOE and SBA Research Act would simply require the Small Business 
Administration and America's 17 national labs to collaborate to ensure 
that small businesses are better utilized within the Department of 
Energy procurement process.
  The Department of Energy is one of the largest procurers of small 
business goods and services in the government. Through the DOE's 
national laboratories, small businesses can play a critical role in 
executing the DOE's mission.
  My district, which is home to one of these laboratories, Brookhaven 
National Lab, which is leading the way by prioritizing working with 
small businesses, specifically BNL and Suffolk County small businesses 
have created a mutually beneficial relationship based upon cooperative 
research and technical assistance.
  Despite good intentions throughout the Federal system, far too often 
small businesses have been made to endure tremendous frustrations 
related to Federal contracting because the Federal contracting process 
is incredibly complex and bureaucratic and plagued with many 
inconsistencies and nuances.
  Some programs, such as the Small Business Innovation Research 
program, operate differently in each agency. This means a small 
business utilizing the same program may have to meet significantly 
different requirements from one agency to the next.
  My bill, the DOE and SBA Research Act, seeks to remedy this problem.
  A small business' work with the Federal Government can be a 
frustrating maze, and this bipartisan bill will help bring existing 
resources and opportunities to innovative and successful small 
businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to 
support the DOE and SBA Research Act.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am 
ready to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, small businesses produce more than 14 times more patents 
than large businesses and universities and employ nearly 40 percent of 
scientists and engineers. Enhancing coordination between the Small 
Business Administration and the Department of Energy will hopefully 
increase opportunities for small businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors for their work, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 
legislation from Mr. Thanedar and Mr. LaLota, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 4669, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to provide 
for Department of Energy and Small Business Administration joint 
research and development activities, and for other purposes.''.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7105, the WOSB Certification 
and Opportunity Expansion Act, sponsored by the Committee on Small 
Business' Ranking Member Velazquez.
  One of the Committee on Small Business' top priorities is combating 
fraud and abuse within the government's contracting programs. Small 
business participation in Federal contracting ensures a strong and 
resilient industrial base.
  Congress sets a governmentwide goal to spend at least 5 percent of 
its procurement dollars with women-owned small businesses. However, 
since this goal contains self-certified firms, it is hard to tell the 
accuracy of the data. This bill would remove self-certified firms from 
this governmentwide goal. This will add accountability measures to make 
sure the businesses competing for these contracting dollars are not 
misrepresenting themselves.
  I was proud to work with the ranking member on this important piece 
of legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for H.R. 7105 and 
ensure that certified women small business owners are not unfairly shut 
out of the Federal marketplace by fraudsters.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, empowering female entrepreneurs has long been a top 
priority of mine and enhancing the programs that impact the success of 
women-owned small businesses continues to guide my work on our 
committee.
  That is why I am pleased we are considering my legislation, the WOSB 
Certification and Opportunity Expansion Act, which, as amended, will 
improve and enhance the SBA's women-owned small business contracting 
program.
  The WOSB program is a valuable tool for Federal agencies to contract 
with small businesses that are owned by women. However, a number of 
factors hinder the program's effectiveness. These limitations then 
translate into reduced contracting opportunities.
  As a result, the data continues to show that women-owned small 
businesses are not seeing the contracting opportunities that should 
accompany the level of participation in the Federal marketplace.
  My bill will move away from self-certification and require Federal 
agencies to only count contracts awarded to certified WOSBs toward 
their procurement goals.
  This bill will help address a major concern that I regularly hear 
from WOSBs: that the program is more difficult to use than the other 
SBA programs, and that it is in part because WOSBs are not SBA 
certified.
  Stakeholders highlight that when combined with other confusing and 
cumbersome WOSB-specific requirements, the lack of SBA certification 
creates a risk that disincentivizes use of the authorities by 
contracting officers.

                              {time}  1715

  It is my hope that by moving more WOSBs through the SBA certification 
process, we will see Federal agencies more confidently and frequently 
set aside sole source contracts to women-owned small businesses.
  That has always been the goal of the WOSB program: to level the 
playing field for women in industries where they are underrepresented. 
My bill helps to do just that, and I urge all Members to support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaLota).
  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams for yielding me 
the time today and Ranking Member Velazquez, a fellow proud New Yorker, 
for leading this effort with me. It is a good day when Members of the 
same State delegation from different parties can work together to 
benefit New York's small businesses and small businesses throughout 
this great country of ours.
  Mr. Speaker, our bipartisan WOSB Certification and Opportunity 
Expansion Act would phase out self-certified, women-owned small 
businesses from the governmentwide procurement goals. In doing so, this 
bill would achieve two main things. It will protect the integrity of 
the women-owned small business program, and it will prevent the abuse 
of Federal small business contracting goals.
  Self-certification, according to the SBA Office of Inspector General 
and others, presents significant risks of fraud and impedes the 
progress of businesses which rightfully qualify. While others can self-
certify, women small business owners in the SBA's women-owned small 
business program undergo a certification program to ensure that only 
women-owned firms enter.
  This bill aligns the women-owned small business program with similar 
programs that no longer count self-certified firms in the SBA's goals. 
A similar provision phasing out self-certified service-disabled 
veteran-owned small businesses from the procurement goals passed in the 
FY24 NDAA.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the WOSB Certification and Opportunity Expansion Act.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close.
  Mr. Speaker, I have drafted this bill in a way that I believe ensures 
women-owned small businesses will not be harmed during the transition 
away from self-certification and that Congress has the tools necessary 
to conduct oversight of that transition.
  There are sufficient protections built into the legislation so that 
women-owned firms are not penalized and specifically will not lose 
contracts if issues arise during implementation. Utilizing WOSBs in our 
Federal marketplace is critical for their success and the success of 
our national economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important 
bill to enhance the WOSB program, bolster its use, and provide female 
entrepreneurs with additional opportunities for success. I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation from Ranking Member Velazquez and 
Congressman LaLota. I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7105, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

       SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION RURAL PERFORMANCE REPORT ACT

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 5265) to amend the Small Business Act to require a 
report on the performance of the Office of Rural Affairs, to require a 
report on the memorandum of understanding between the Small Business 
Administration and the Department of Agriculture entered into on April

                               H.R. 5265

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of

each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5265, the Small Business 
Administration Rural Performance Report Act, sponsored by the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. Alford).
  It should come as no surprise that rural entrepreneurs face unique 
challenges. In extending assistance to these entrepreneurs, the 
Department of Agriculture and the Small Business Administration offer a 
variety of programs to help them start and grow their businesses.
  Unfortunately, government agencies often act in a silo and become 
ineffective in their outreach. That is why the Trump administration 
created a partnership between the USDA and the SBA to better tailor 
their outreach and services to rural entrepreneurs.
  After our committee marked up this bill, we were happy to see the SBA 
announce that they are going to work to renew another agreement with 
the Department of Agriculture. While this progress should not go 
unnoticed, this bill goes further to require a report to track the 
effectiveness of this agreement and the SBA's Office of Rural Affairs. 
If we are going to be spending taxpayer dollars to help accomplish a 
goal, there must be performance metrics to see where the ROI is for the 
taxpayers and the businesses they are helping.
  Mr. Speaker, it is vital that Congress knows just how impactful these 
efforts are so we can ensure our rural entrepreneurs are not left 
behind. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5265, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Today, we are considering H.R. 5265, the Small Business 
Administration Rural Performance Report Act, which, as amended, 
requires an annual performance report and budget justification for the 
Office of Rural Affairs.
  Mr. Golden has worked relentlessly to increase SBA outreach to rural 
small businesses and make sure the Office of Rural Affairs remains 
active. I commend Mr. Golden for his efforts, and I am quite 
disappointed we are not considering his legislation today, which would 
have enhanced the Office of Rural Affairs and was unanimously approved 
by the committee in September. I look forward to its speedy 
consideration.
  Today, we are considering legislation that would require a 
performance report and budget updates from the Office of Rural Affairs 
so that we can stay apprised of its activities. Currently, we get this 
information by simply asking the agency for an update, but this bill 
would now statutorily mandate that it is provided.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pappas for joining Mr. Alford in sponsoring 
this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Alford).
  Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership of our Ranking Member 
Velazquez and our esteemed Chairman Williams. It is, indeed, a pleasure 
to be on this committee. There are many Members here today who are on 
the Small Business Committee and are making a difference for America in 
every piece of legislation we pass.
  I rise today to speak on the Small Business Administration Rural 
Performance Report Act, a bill that we introduced to support our rural 
small businesses.
  These businesses are essential to rural America, providing over 54 
percent of employment in rural communities and counties. This bill 
would help us understand how the Small Business Administration is 
really helping them succeed.
  The bill requires two reports. First, it would give us insight into 
the Office

[[Page H725]]

of Rural Affairs, ensuring that they are providing the proper help to 
rural businesses.
  We are all aware of the crucial role that these businesses play in 
our economy, yet the support that they offer is often unknown to small 
business owners. At a hearing just last summer, several small business 
owners, including Jennifer Cassaday, a constituent of mine who owns 
Byrd's Pecan Delights in Adrian, Missouri, came here to testify that 
she didn't even know that the Office of Rural Affairs existed.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill would change that. It demands clear, detailed 
reports on the Office of Rural Affairs and its efforts to aid these 
businesses and people like Jennifer.
  Are they providing the right assistance? Are the resources and 
information reaching those who need it the most?
  It is time we had solid answers. This bill would provide them.
  Mr. Speaker, the second part of this report requires a review of a 
memorandum of understanding between the SBA and the Department of 
Agriculture. This Trump-era MOU was a recognition that ag goes hand in 
hand with rural small businesses.
  Supporting this bill means that we are committed to making sure that 
our rural entrepreneurs have the support they need in a timely fashion. 
We are standing up for the underrepresented, ensuring our rural small 
businesses are not left behind in America. We are promoting the 
accountability and oversight needed to support the backbone of our 
economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for transparency, 
responsibility, and the success of our rural small business owners.

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, small businesses are powerful drivers of economic growth 
across the United States, employing 46 percent of the workforce and 
generating two-thirds of new jobs. In rural areas, self-employment 
tends to be higher than in urban and suburban areas, but the challenges 
they face are much greater. Rural small businesses have a harder time 
securing affordable capital, finding talented workers, and making ends 
meet.
  Administrator Guzman is increasing SBA's commitment to rural America 
by appointing a new director to the office and improving the outreach 
and engagement with rural small businesses. She recognizes the 
importance of ensuring rural small businesses have access to SBA's 
vital programs. With this type of assistance, rural small businesses 
can thrive and, in turn, create good-paying jobs and lift up 
communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. Alford, Mr. Pappas, and Mr. Golden for 
their leadership on this issue, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation brought to us by Mr. Pappas, Mr. Golden, 
and Mr. Alford. I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5265, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                        ENCOURAGING SUCCESS ACT

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 6591) to amend section 8(a) of the Small Business 
Act to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration 
to regularly reassess the asset and net worth thresholds for qualifying 
as an economically disadvantaged individual, and for other purposes, as 
amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 6591

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Success Act''.

     SEC. 2. REGULAR REASSESSMENT OF THE THRESHOLDS FOR 
                   ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS.

       (a) In General.--Section 8(a)(6) of the Small Business Act 
     (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(6)) is amended by adding at the end the 
     following new subparagraph:
       ``(F)(i) Not later than one year after the date of the 
     enactment of this subparagraph, and not less frequently than 
     every four years thereafter, the Administrator shall assess 
     and, if appropriate, revise the maximum value of asset and 
     the maximum net worth an individual may have to qualify as an 
     economically disadvantaged individual under subparagraph (A) 
     to account for changes in the economy, including inflation 
     and other factors as determined appropriate by the 
     Administrator.
       ``(ii) The Administrator shall make each covered revision 
     by issuing a rule after an opportunity for public notice and 
     comment.
       ``(iii) To the extent practicable, the Administrator shall 
     coordinate the activities carried out under clause (i) with 
     the activities required under section 1344(a)(2) of the Small 
     Business Jobs Act of 2010 (15 U.S.C. 632 note).
       ``(iv) In this subparagraph, the term `covered revision' 
     means a revision described in clause (i) that the 
     Administrator determines is appropriate pursuant to an 
     assessment under such clause.''.
       (b) Compliance With Cutgo.--No additional amounts are 
     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act or the 
     amendments made by this Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6591, the Encouraging 
Success Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ellzey), my 
good friend.
  The 8(a) program allows certain small businesses to compete for 
valuable contracting opportunities. However, SBA regulations threaten 
to remove the participating firms if the owner reaches certain 
financial thresholds. While these thresholds are necessary to ensure 
that only true small businesses are utilizing this program, it can 
force some small business owners to make a tough decision: proactively 
stop expanding their business so they can stay in the program or grow 
outside the limits set by the SBA and get kicked out of the program.
  I spoke with a female veteran in my district who was facing this 
exact issue. The bill doesn't solve all the issues in this program, but 
it requires the SBA to reassess the 8(a) asset threshold cap every 4 
years, ensuring it is in line with market realities.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6591, the 
Encouraging Success Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1730

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Ellzey and 
Thanedar, for their work on this bill, the Encouraging Success Act.
  The 8(a) program is one of the most effective tools for minority 
businessowners to get their foot in the door of the Federal 
marketplace.
  The program is critical for entrepreneurs who have faced 
discrimination. This bill requires the SBA to regularly assess, and, 
when necessary, update the economic threshold for program 
participation.
  I share the sponsors' concerns that the lack of reassessment or 
readjustment can penalize growth and that a regular assessment will 
ensure that the program keeps pace with changing economic environments.
  Mr. Speaker, the National Minority Supplier Development Council has 
said that this legislation will enhance the effectiveness of SBA 
programs, including the esteemed 8(a) program, ensuring they continue 
to serve as powerful catalysts for community wealth building and 
inclusive economic development.
  The 8(a) program remains a win-win for the government and for 
communities across the country. It has led to

[[Page H726]]

a more diverse Federal market and supply chain, provided billions of 
dollars annually through streamlined contracting processes for minority 
businessowners, and continues to work to help minority businessowners 
overcome the real and ongoing discrimination that would otherwise hold 
them back.
  Keeping 8(a) intact and relevant must remain a top priority. I 
appreciate the sponsors for their work, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ellzey).
  Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams and Ranking Member 
Velazquez for allowing me to lay out H.R. 5961, the Encouraging Success 
Act. Bipartisanship on this committee is alive and well, and I thank 
Congressman Thanedar for joining me on this bill.
  The Small Business Administration's 8(a) program was established in 
the 1970s to help small businesses compete with large corporations for 
U.S. Government contracts.
  A qualifying small business can only be a part of the program for 9 
years. To initially qualify and remain in the 8(a) program, there is a 
cap to the value of a small business' assets.
  Since the program's inception, the asset cap has only been raised 
twice and is currently at the very small amount of $6.5 million.
  The asset threshold is set through an SBA-determined regulation, and 
the law does not outline any process of when or how the SBA should 
reassess the threshold to remain in line with market changes.
  Unfortunately, because the requirements to initially qualify for the 
program or to remain in it haven't kept up with market changes, the cap 
is set to a level at which a small business is disadvantaged to compete 
in the open market at the end of the 9-year program.
  The SBA's slow-to-change attitude with the asset cap can limit the 
success of an 8(a) small business or outright kill it.
  With the threat of being graduated out of the 8(a) program, small 
business owners must decide whether their firm's growth is worth being 
removed from the program.
  Our bill, H.R. 6591, helps solve the situation and encourages success 
of small businesses by compelling the SBA administrator to review the 
qualification caps with greater frequency to ensure that small 
businesses participating in the 8(a) program are allowed to grow big 
enough to compete with larger companies, once their participation in 
the program ends. We ask for your support for H.R. 6591.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the great work of my 
colleagues on this bill, and I yield myself the balance of my time.
  I will close by noting that 3 weeks ago, the committee held a hearing 
on small business size standards and contracting policies and the 
barriers they can pose to growth.
  As we discussed, the Federal Government needs to both recruit and 
retain small business government contractors.
  We are seeing that retaining small firms, like those in the 8(a) 
program, is a necessity for the health of the industrial base.
  This bill will contribute to the retention of growing small 
businesses. It is a productive step designed to ensure that minority 
businessowners can succeed, thrive, and grow in the Federal marketplace 
and beyond.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation from Congressmen Ellzey and Thanedar, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6591, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  PROVIDING WEBSITE TO REPORT FRAUD RELATING TO CERTAIN COVID-19 LOANS

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 5426) to require the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration to provide a link to resources for submitting 
reports on suspected fraud relating to certain COVID-19 loans.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 5426

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. WEBSITE TO REPORT FRAUD RELATING TO CERTAIN COVID-
                   19 LOANS.

       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small 
     Business Administration shall include on the primary website 
     of the Administration a link to a website of the Office of 
     the Inspector General of the Small Business Administration 
     regarding reporting fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and 
     misconduct, and containing a resource for individuals to 
     report suspected cases of fraud with respect to a covered 
     loan to the Administration.
       (b) Covered Loan Defined.--In this section, the term 
     ``covered loan'' means--
       (1) a loan made under paragraph (36) or (37) of section 
     7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)); or
       (2) a loan made under section 7(b) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 
     636(b)) in response to COVID-19 during the covered period (as 
     defined in section 1110(a) of the CARES Act (15 U.S.C. 
     9009)).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5426, a bill to require the 
SBA's administrator to place a visible link on their website to report 
COVID fraud.
  Last summer, the SBA's Inspector General testified to our committee 
that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the SBA distributed more than 
$200 billion in potentially fraudulent loans.
  The committee was also told that in order to work through all these 
cases, it will take more than 100 years of work. That is simply not a 
realistic feat, and they need all the help they can get from the 
American people.
  Reporting fraud in the SBA should be easy for everyday Americans to 
do. Our committee now has a direct fraud reporting link on our website, 
and the SBA should do the same.
  When our committee was researching the need for this bill, we found 
that the only link to report COVID fraud redirected users to a 
different website that was in Spanish.
  Even after we figured out how to correct the language, it was unclear 
how to actually report the fraud. This bill will ensure that reporting 
fraud is simply one click away.
  It should be a top priority of this body to recoup as many of these 
taxpayer dollars as possible and in the most timely and efficient 
manner possible.
  H.R. 5426 is a commonsense bill that will help individuals easily 
report suspected fraudulent activity and help the SBA and the OIG 
prioritize which potentially fraudulent loans to investigate.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Today we are considering H.R. 5426, which will require the SBA to put 
a link to the IG's fraud hotline on its website for whistleblowers to 
report suspected fraud.
  The good news is that the Biden administration SBA already has a link 
to the OIG's hotline on its main landing page, but with this bill, it 
will be here to stay.

[[Page H727]]

  In July, Inspector General Ware testified that his office has 
received 250,000 hotline complaints since the beginning of the 
pandemic, and more than 90,000 have been identified as actionable. This 
amounts to more than 100 years of investigative casework.
  To that end, the single most important action we can take to support 
the OIG is to make sure we give them the resources they need to 
investigate bad actors.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of Ms. Van Duyne and Mr. 
Landsman to curb fraud, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).
  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support of 
this legislation.
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Business Administration 
oversaw what has been described as ``the biggest fraud in a 
generation,'' doling out more than $200 billion to scammers, foreign 
crime rings, and others who took advantage of a pandemic to enrich 
themselves.
  According to the Justice Department Inspector General Michael 
Horowitz, the SBA invited this fraud by failing to implement basic 
safeguards to ensure taxpayer funds were going to the right people. 
Some of the pandemic aid even went to people involved in transnational 
crime organizations.
  When government mandates forced small businesses to close their 
doors, some resulting in permanent closures, fraudsters were out taking 
expensive vacations, buying Lamborghinis, mansions, private jets, 
horses, luxury jewelry, and more, all on the taxpayers' dime. While we 
work to recover the stolen funds, those criminals must be identified 
and prosecuted.
  The Small Business Administration not only failed to implement 
safeguards to prevent fraud of this scope, but they also failed to 
comply with the law originally authorizing the aid, which required the 
agency to include an easily accessible link for the public to report 
suspected fraud. Instead, the SBA has ignored legal requirements and 
made it incredibly difficult to report fraud.
  As my colleagues and I highlighted during a hearing last year, if you 
were even able to locate the SBA's link to report fraudulent COVID-19 
loans--which were buried in their website--where did it take you? As 
our chairman noted, it took you to a different website that was written 
entirely in Spanish.
  The Republican-led Small Business Committee has created a direct link 
for Americans to easily report pandemic fraud, and the Small Business 
Administration must do the same.
  I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan legislation to make it 
easier to report pandemic fraud.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Over the past 3 years, this committee has played an important role in 
examining the pandemic relief programs, which helped millions of small 
businesses stay afloat in unprecedented times.
  While there may be disagreement on the actual estimates of fraud, it 
is clear we need to work together to protect the integrity of the SBA 
programs from bad actors.

  The SBA, under the leadership of Administrator Guzman, has taken 
strong steps to root out fraud in the pandemic relief programs and put 
strong controls in place to prevent future fraud.
  In 2022, SBA established a Fraud Risk Management Board, aligning its 
practices with GAO's oversight policies.
  A new role was also created, the SBA Special Counsel for Enterprise 
Risk, to advise the administrator of fraud and risk management 
activities.
  The agency continues to work collaboratively with the SBA Inspector 
General, the Interagency COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force, and the 
Department of Justice to recover stolen funds.
  I thank Ms. Van Duyne and Mr. Landsman for looking for ways to 
enhance the work that the SBA is undertaking to combat fraud, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation from Congresswoman Van Duyne and 
Congressman Landsman, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5426.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the 
ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a 
quorum is not present.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.
  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

     the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, or a 
     national certifying entity approved by the Administrator as a 
     small business concern owned and controlled by women from 
     competing for contracts restricted under section 8(m)(2) of

     controlled by women submits a notice that such concern is no 
     longer a small business concern owned and controlled by

       (2) the date on which the Administrator, Federal agency, or 
     entity that provided such certification determines that the

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7128, The WOSB Integrity 
Act of 2024, sponsored by Representative Maloy from the great State of 
Utah.
  The WOSB Integrity Act removes self-certification of size from this 
contracting program that is reserved for women-owned small businesses.
  It is vital that there are programs to help small business owners 
access Federal contracting opportunities. That is where the Small 
Business Administration's women-owned small business program, also 
known as WOSB, comes in. This program allows women entrepreneurs to 
compete for unique contracting opportunities.
  Unfortunately, the Federal Government currently does not 
independently verify that these businesses are truly small businesses. 
Firms can simply self-certify themselves as small businesses, 
potentially leading to misrepresentation and fraud to obtain 
contracting opportunities.
  It is vital that women-owned entrepreneurs who participate in the 
WOSB do not have to worry that their competitors misrepresent 
themselves as a small business.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 7128, The 
WOSB Integrity Act of 2024, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Maloy and 
Scholten, for their work on this bill.
  Since its inception, the WOSB program and the administration of the 
program have been a challenge for SBA. Similarly, Federal agencies have 
faced challenges using the authorities that Congress has put in place 
to streamline contracting with women-owned small businesses.
  While working to boost participation of WOSBs and enhance the use of 
these authorities, Congress must also advance initiatives that are 
designed to protect the integrity of the program.
  One issue we are addressing today is the inspector general's report 
that states there is a discrepancy in SBA's implementation of the 
program. The purpose of this bill is to align SBA processes with the 
IG's report and to clarify that we expect SBA to have a process similar 
to the other socioeconomic contracting programs for WOSB 
certifications.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate my colleagues for their work on this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Ms. Maloy).
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Williams for yielding me 
time. I also thank Ranking Member Velazquez for her support on this 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, The WOSB Integrity 
Act of 2024.
  The purpose of this bill is to make sure that the businesses that are 
taking advantage of the WOSB program are, in fact, small businesses. 
They are certifying that they are women-owned, but they are self-
certifying that they are small.
  The SBA inspector general found that there is room for fraud in this 
program, so this is simply a commonsense solution to close a loophole 
to make sure this program is serving the purpose it was intended to 
serve, which is giving women-owned small businesses the opportunity to 
compete in Federal contracting. It encourages fair competition, levels 
the playing field in government contracting, and ensures the 
opportunities are awarded justly and contribute to a competitive small 
business sector.
  We have a goal of awarding 5 percent of government contracts to 
women-owned small businesses. We have no way of knowing how well we are 
doing in meeting that goal if we don't have any way of certifying that 
these WOSBs are, in fact, small businesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I 
thank Ms. Maloy and Ms. Scholten for this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation from Congresswoman Maloy and Scholten, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7128.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the 
ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a 
quorum is not present.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.
  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 7102) to establish an Office of Native American 
Affairs within the Small Business Administration, and for other 
purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

     SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH CUTGO.

       No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to 
     carry out this Act or the amendments made by this Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise today in support of H.R. 7102, the Native American 
Entrepreneurial Opportunity Act, introduced by Representatives Davids 
of Kansas and Crane of Arizona.
  This bill would codify into law the Office of Native American 
Affairs, which has been providing services like counseling, training, 
and Tribal consultations for many years.
  Additionally, this bill installs specific reporting requirements from 
the office. If we are going to be spending taxpayer dollars providing a 
service, it is critical we understand how effectively the services are 
being performed.
  This bill would not appropriate any additional funds or expand 
government in any way, but it would provide Congress with better 
oversight and performance metrics to ensure that this office is 
performing to its fullest extent.
  Native American entrepreneurs, Tribal-owned corporations, and Native 
American small businesses are vital to their local economics.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Davids and Representative Crane 
for their work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7102, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are considering H.R. 7102, the 
Native American Entrepreneurial Opportunity Act.
  Let me begin by commending Ms. Davids for her leadership and 
bipartisan efforts to codify the Office of Native American Affairs at 
SBA. She is a valued member of the Committee on Small Business and has 
remained committed to working with stakeholders to make this bill a 
reality.
  The office has been a tremendous resource for American Indians, 
Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians seeking to launch and grow their 
small businesses. Throughout the year, it engages in several outreach 
activities, including consultations, development and distribution of 
promotional materials, and participation in national economic 
development conferences.
  Codifying the office would ensure that Tribal small businesses have 
access to SBA's full range of business development tools regardless of 
the administration.
  Importantly, the legislation requires that the assistant 
administrator report directly to the Administrator, ensuring the voice 
of the Tribal communities will be heard at SBA.
  I also thank Mr. Crane for joining Ms. Davids in her efforts, and I 
strongly support this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Crane).
  Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-introduce this legislation to 
officially establish the Office of Native American Affairs at the Small 
Business Administration, and I thank Representative Davids for her 
leadership on this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent over half of Arizona's Tribes. 
Something I hear often is there is a need for economic growth and 
opportunity.
  Tribal entrepreneurs who run businesses on reservations face complex 
hurdles when it comes to understanding tax implications, property 
rights, regulatory burdens, and lending. Tribal entrepreneurs should 
have the ability to access SBA's programs just like anyone else, but in 
reality, these communities do not experience adequate access or 
outreach.
  Most importantly, they need specialized expertise to assist them in 
navigating the unique complexities of running a business on a 
reservation--complexities mostly created by us, the Federal Government.
  Economic development in our Tribal communities is crucial. I am 
hopeful that establishing the Office of Native American Affairs into 
statute will bring attention to resources the Small Business 
Administration can provide to Tribal businessowners and encourage the 
office to continue developing new methods for outreach to ensure that 
Tribal businesses are not overlooked. This bill would also ensure that 
Congress can practice proper oversight of the office's activities and 
effectiveness going forward.
  I encourage representatives from this office to come out and visit 
Tribal communities in my district and begin a dialogue with small 
business owners who may be unaware that this office even exists. Doing 
so will allow the Office of Native American Affairs to adjust and 
enhance their programs so they can best serve Tribal small business 
owners.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids).
  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. Velazquez) for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that our Nation's entrepreneurs face 
challenges in starting and operating small businesses. Finding a 
skilled workforce, establishing an effective online presence, and 
building a customer base are hurdles common to all small business 
owners.
  However, our Native American small business owners face these 
challenges in a more severe way. Today, I will highlight a few reasons 
for that disparity.
  First, Native Americans are twice as likely to live in poverty as 
compared to other Americans. This significantly impacts their ability 
to use savings and assets to fund their small businesses, to access 
credit, and to take on the risk of entrepreneurship.
  Second, these businessowners face geographical barriers, with longer 
distances for supply deliveries and a lack of reliable broadband and 
telephone service. These physical obstacles make networking, finding 
mentors, and reaching out to a consumer base a bit more difficult, 
ultimately reducing their chances of success.
  Third, Native Americans who are entrepreneurs often face greater 
hurdles in attracting private investment and accessing Federal 
contracting opportunities. Addressing these challenges is crucial to 
leveling the playing field for Tribal small business communities and 
bolstering our overall economy.
  Currently, the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Native 
American Affairs works diligently to connect Native businessowners with 
entrepreneurial development, lending, and procurement programs. 
However, the absence of a congressional mandate for this office limits 
its capacity and

[[Page H730]]

leaves it vulnerable to changes from one administration to the next.
  That is why we really need to pass this Native American 
Entrepreneurial Opportunity Act. This bill would codify the SBA's 
Office of Native American Affairs into Federal law, establishing an 
assistant administrator role to oversee operations and report directly 
to SBA leadership. It would also require the office to report to 
Congress on its successes in Indian Country.
  Native-owned businesses employ over 300,000 Americans and are vital 
drivers of our national economy. These Tribal businesses deserve a seat 
at the table to advocate not only for the challenges that I mentioned 
earlier but also for the successes and achievements that they have.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Crane, my Republican colleague and 
co-lead on this, for his partnership in introducing this bill. I urge 
Members on both sides of the aisle to stand united in support of this 
crucial legislation and vote in favor of successful entrepreneurship in 
Tribal communities.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, Native American-owned businesses are powerful economic 
engines, contributing over $33 billion to the U.S. economy every year 
and employing more than 200,000 people in their communities.

                              {time}  1800

  By enhancing the Office of Native American Affairs, SBA will be able 
to work on behalf of Indian Country and better target resources to 
Indian Tribes.
  I once again thank Representatives Davids and Crane for their 
bipartisan work to provide assistance to these critically important 
businesses and entrepreneurs.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
this commonsense legislation brought to us by Congresswoman Davids and 
Congressman Crane, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7102.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

PREVENTING ACCESS TO AMERICANS' BULK SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA AND UNITED 
 STATES GOVERNMENT-RELATED DATA BY COUNTRIES OF CONCERN--MESSAGE FROM 
        THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-109)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States
  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby 
report that I have issued an Executive Order that expands the scope of 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 
2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and 
Services Supply Chain), and further addressed with additional measures 
in Executive Order 14034 of June 9, 2021 (Protecting Americans' 
Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries).
  The continuing effort of certain countries of concern to access 
Americans' sensitive personal data and United States Government-related 
data constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its 
source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. Access to 
Americans' bulk sensitive personal data or United States Government-
related data increases the ability of countries of concern to engage in 
a wide range of malicious activities, including espionage, influence, 
kinetic, or cyber operations, or to identify other potential strategic 
advantages over the United States.
  To address this threat and to take further steps with respect to the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873, the order 
authorizes the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of 
Homeland Security and in consultation with the heads of relevant 
agencies, to issue, subject to public notice and comment, regulations 
to prohibit or otherwise restrict the large-scale transfer of 
Americans' personal data to countries of concern and to provide 
safeguards around other activities that can give those countries access 
to sensitive data. Section 2(b) of the order authorizes the Attorney 
General, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, to take 
such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and 
to employ all other powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the order.
  In addition, section 2(d) of the order authorizes the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, acting through the Director of the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, in coordination with the Attorney 
General and in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, to 
propose, seek public comment on, and publish security requirements that 
address the unacceptable risk posed by restricted transactions, as 
identified by the Attorney General. Section 2(e) of the order 
authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the 
Attorney General, to take such actions, including promulgating rules, 
regulations, standards, and requirements; issuing interpretive 
guidance; and employing all other powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes described in 
section 2(d) of the order.
  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
                                                Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,  
The White House, February 28, 2024.

  The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from 
the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to transmit herewith a 
     copy of a letter received from Ms. Kristen Zebrowski Stavisky 
     and Mr. Raymond J. Riley, III, Co-Executive Directors, New 
     York State Board of Elections, indicating that, according to 
     the unofficial results for the Special Election held on 
     February 13, 2024, the Honorable Thomas R. Suozzi was elected 
     for Representative to Congress for the Third Congressional 
     District of New York.
       With best wishes, I am,
           Sincerely,
                                                Kevin F. McCumber,
     Acting Clerk.
                                  ____

                                                    New York State


                                           Board of Elections,

                                                February 14, 2024.
     Hon. Kevin F. McCumber,
     Acting Clerk, House of Representatives,

       Dear Mr. McCumber: This is to advise you that the 
     unofficial results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, 
     February 13, 2024, for Representative in Congress from the

     Suozzi received 91,338 or 53.70% of the total number of votes 
     cast for that office.
       It would appear from these unofficial results that Thomas

       WELCOMING THE HONORABLE THOMAS R. SUOZZI TO THE HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Nadler) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, as dean of the New York delegation, it is my 
distinct honor to rise today to welcome my good friend Congressman Tom 
Suozzi back to the people's House.
  The people of New York's Third Congressional District have elected a 
Representative with the experience, character, and commitment to solve 
problems confronting everyday Americans and deliver for his 
constituents.
  Tom is also a great family man. He is a devoted father, husband, and 
public servant who upholds the values instilled in him by his family. 
He has devoted most of his adult life to public service: first as the 
mayor of his hometown, Glen Cove, for 8 years; then as the county 
executive of Nassau County for 8 years, before serving as a United 
States Congressman for 6 years.
  From working tirelessly to secure investments for the Northport VA 
Medical Center in Long Island to helping secure billions in Federal 
support for New York in pandemic relief and infrastructure funding, 
Tom's outstanding record in Congress speaks for itself.
  Tom loves New York, he loves his country, and his love for public 
service runs deep. He is the kind of person we need serving in this 
House at this moment, and it gives me great pleasure to reintroduce him 
as our colleague, the gentleman from New York, Tom Suozzi.
  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Mr. Suozzi.
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Jerry and the New York delegation, 
all my colleagues, and my friends and supporters who are here tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I never thought I would be back here, but the Lord works 
in mysterious ways, and God made a way when there was no way.
  I thank God for blessing me with this great responsibility, and I 
thank God for my best friend and partner for 30 years, my wife, Helene. 
She hates that.
  Mr. Speaker, on the night of my election victory, I promised the 
people of Long Island and Queens I would deliver a simple message to 
this Chamber: Wake up. The people are sick and tired of the finger-
pointing and the petty partisan bickering. They want us to work 
together.
  They want you guys to work together, too. What are you doing? You are 
supposed to be clapping for that.
  Mr. Speaker, I know there are so many good people in this Chamber on 
both sides of the aisle, but people are worried about the cost of 
living; they are worried about the chaos at the border; they are 
worried about Israel, Gaza, and Ukraine.
  They look to Congress, and what do they see? The extremists get all 
the attention. We are letting ourselves be bullied by our base. We 
aren't getting anything done. We need less chaos and more common sense.
  The last few months, I have talked with Democrats, Republicans, and 
Independents, and they all ask the same thing: What about me? What are 
you doing for me? Enough with the theater and the drama, enough with 
the hyperbole and the histrionics, enough with the shutdowns and the 
put-downs.
  The people aren't paying us to make things worse. The people pay us 
to be in the solutions business.
  Mr. Speaker, you and I came to Congress together in 2017. I remember 
when you founded the Honor and Civility Caucus. You said at the time it 
was to restore collegiality and encourage productive dialogue. Sign me 
up. Sign me up right away. Mr. Speaker, I know you believe in 
collegiality and productive dialogue. We need more of that and less of 
the hot air fanning the flames of anger that happens much too often in 
our country these days.
  Mr. Speaker, after my recent election you said something I must 
gently take exception to. You said: Tom Suozzi ran like a Republican. 
Now, I know you meant that as a compliment. Let me be clear. Mr. 
Speaker, I am a true blue, dyed-in-the-wool Democrat; but more 
important, like you, Mr. Speaker, and the men and women in this 
Chamber, I am a true blue, dyed-in-the-wool American.
  Like any patriot of the greatest country on Earth, I am willing to 
compromise to try and solve problems like the chaos at the border. The 
bipartisan Senate bill doesn't have everything I wanted. I believe that 
Dreamers and TPS recipients should be granted a pathway to citizenship, 
and millions of others should have a path to legalization, but I will 
support a bipartisan compromise.

                              {time}  1915

  To not do so will keep the border open, will endanger peace in 
Israel, and will empower Vladimir Putin.
  I know compromise is hard in this town, Mr. Speaker, but bring a 
bipartisan compromise to the floor, and I guarantee it will pass.
  All of the issues we face in this country are complicated, every 
single one of them, and you can't solve anything in an environment of 
fear and anger. We can't fix them with a tweet or a press conference or 
even a speech.
  I know many of you in this Chamber. I know a whole lot of you. You 
are inspired to do this work because of the command: Love thy neighbor. 
Let's actually do that. Let's do the hard work and get back to the 
solutions business.
  Sadly, many of the people in America believe Democrats and 
Republicans can't work together. They have told me, Tom, wake up. You 
have to face the real world.
  The real world is not something we must simply face. The real world 
is something that we as free men and women actively create. We make the 
real world.
  I love this country. My father came here from Italy as a young boy, 
was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during World War II, and 
went to Harvard Law School on the GI Bill.
  It is hard to imagine today, but he faced rampant discrimination as 
an Italian immigrant, and no one would hire him, even though he went to 
Harvard, so he started his own law firm.
  At 28 years old, he ran for city court judge and became the youngest 
judge in the history of New York State. What a country.
  My father lived a great American success story like many of the 
stories in this room, and I will do everything I can to honor my 
father's legacy. More importantly, I will do everything I can to honor 
this Nation's legacy.
  We all know what politics has become. Let's think about what it could 
be. While I may be the only one being sworn in today, what if we all 
see this as a fresh start?
  What if we all took this chance to break some of our bad habits? What 
if today we remembered why we ran for office in the first place? Let's 
get back into the solutions business.
  God bless the men and women of this Chamber. God bless the important 
work we do. God bless the United States of America.

                          ____________________

                       HONORING LAKEN HOPE RILEY

  (Mr. COLLINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, we, the Georgia delegation, rise tonight to 
honor the life and legacy of Laken Riley, who was murdered last week in 
Athens, Georgia, on the campus of the University of Georgia.
  Allow me to share a few words about Laken directly from her parents:
  Laken was an amazing daughter, sister, and friend.
  She was selfless, lived to be an example for others, and was a 
dedicated servant of her community from a young age.
  Laken's servant heart came from her love for our Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ, who guided her steps and shaped the way she lived.
  Her faith informed her decision to enter the nursing program at 
Augusta University where she joined the A Chi O sorority and made 
countless friends who loved her and miss her dearly.
  I will conclude with this message to Laken from her mom and dad: 
``Rest in peace, our angel. We look forward to seeing you again one day 
in heaven. Until then, we will do our best to make you proud.''
  God help us.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).
  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for taking this 
moment to recognize the life of Laken Hope Riley.
  Mr. Speaker, parents and communities across the State of Georgia are 
extremely shocked, heartbroken, and outraged about the murder of Laken 
Hope Riley.
  She was only 22 years old. She had a lot of life before her, but we 
should also focus mostly on the life and the legacy that she lived in 
her short time here.
  She was a nursing student from Woodstock, Georgia, but her tragic 
death has devastated our community and sent shock waves across the 
State. Our prayers are with Laken's family and friends as they begin to 
navigate this tremendously difficult time.
  It is clear from her parents that Laken was a special young lady who 
went out of her way to make everyone feel special and part of her 
family.
  She was a gifted and exemplary student, a talented athlete, and the 
light of her family and community. Her parents describe her character 
and her loving nature this way:


[[Page H734]]


  

       She knew when to listen. She knew when to speak. She knew 
     when to give you some tough love, and she knew when you 
     needed a hug.
       She will forever be our loving oldest daughter and the best 
     big sister and role model a parent could ask for.

  We will not rest until we ensure justice for her and her family.
  Colleagues, will you please join in a moment of silence for Laken 
Hope Riley, a wonderful young woman taken from her family and this 
world much too soon.

                          ____________________

                         BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, since Biden took office, 
there have been nearly 10 million illegal aliens entering America, with 
over 340 on the terrorist watch list. Sadly, this includes thousands of 
unaccompanied military-aged young men from dictatorships, as confirmed 
last night by Senator Marco Rubio with Sean Hannity.
  Last month, I joined Speaker   Mike Johnson at Eagle Pass, Texas, and 
witnessed the madness. It is intentional irresponsibility thinking 
potential mass murderers will be low-information voters for a 
permanent, one-party Democrat, Big Government, as violent criminals 
cross to murder more Americans on our streets.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected 
America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism moves from the 
Afghanistan safe haven to America.
  We do not need new border laws. We need to enforce the laws that we 
have. Biden safely opened borders for dictators as more 9/11 attacks 
across America are imminent, as warned by the FBI.
  War criminal Putin will face trial for the assassination of Alexei 
Navalny. His widow, Yulia, is a hero for the oppressed people of 
Russia.

                       REPUBLICANS' FAILED FOCUS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the continued 
Republican leadership crisis.
  Here we go again--2 days away from a government shutdown due to a 
lack of funding. Republican leadership is so poor that it can only 
achieve stopgap funding measures. There is no long-term solution 
because MAGA Republicans have no long-term goals.
  They have no long-term goals because there is no long-term vision to 
better the country. They do not see how a lack of humanitarian care for 
innocent Palestinian families causes more instability and extremism in 
the Middle East.
  They do not understand how a lack of funding for Ukraine creates more 
political and economic instability across the globe. They deny that 
their rejection of an incredibly popular border security bill allows 
more fentanyl and illegal drugs to threaten American communities. They 
do not see because they do not care.

                 RECOGNIZING PRIVATE CHARLES D. STALEY

  (Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Private Charles D. Staley, 
an American hero who served during the Korean war.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On February 28, 2024, page H734, in the second column, the 
following appeared: Ms BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
  
  The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  Private Staley was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and moved to Blount 
County in the sixth grade. His family owned and operated Maryville 
Monument, which played a large role in placing many veterans' 
headstones and markers throughout the county.
  Private Staley was also drafted in the Army on May 11, 1953. He 
served his country with honor and an unfailing sense of duty as a 
military policeman at Fort Jackson.
  Private Staley volunteered for overseas duty in March 1954 where he 
served behind the Iron Curtain during the Berlin Crisis. He was 
discharged from the Army on April 30, 1955.
  He then served as the Blount County veterans service officer for 30 
years. During that time, Private Staley demonstrated incredible 
professionalism and integrity. He has won the respect and admiration of 
his colleagues, his fellow veterans, and people all over our community.

  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Private Charles Staley as 
the Tennessee Second District's February 2024 Veteran of the Month.

                       VISIT TO WAR-TORN UKRAINE

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as a result of intense 
fighting on the front line, a Ukrainian soldier's leg was blown off. 
However, he lived to share his story with me. He now uses a prosthetic 
leg to stand.
  February 24 marked 2 years that Ukraine has successfully resisted 
Russia's unprovoked invasion.
  During my recent visit to war-torn Ukraine, I witnessed the 
undeniable resilience of its people. While Ukrainian soldiers have 
given so much, including life and limbs, much like this soldier, we 
must not ignore their urgent plea for assistance to finish the fight.
  Democracies around the world look to us, and the eyes of the world 
are on

us, including Putin's. Ukrainians are fighting tirelessly on the front 
lines, not just for their nation, but for democracy.
  Mr. Speaker, in the face of these threats, the time to act is now.

          UNLEASHING FULL POTENTIAL OF DOMESTIC NUCLEAR ENERGY

  (Mr. FULCHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, nuclear energy development has made 
tremendous strides to become one of the most carbon-free, safe, and 
reliable sources of energy.
  Beyond powering cities, the nuclear industry provides jobs to 
Americans and fuels the economy. For example, the Idaho National 
Laboratory, in my home State of Idaho, is a major economic driver, 
bringing an economic impact of nearly $4 billion just last year.
  The Atomic Energy Advancement Act provides a clear pathway for 
industry leaders such as INL to continue the production of affordable 
and sustainable energy by removing barriers that hinder the development 
of nuclear power, unleashing the full potential of our domestic nuclear 
energy, and taking away the need to rely on foreign adversaries.
  This legislation will streamline the licensing process, accelerate 
the development of nuclear power, and expedite the regulatory process 
for advanced reactors while building the nuclear workforce at the NRC.
  For this and many other reasons, I voted in support of H.R. 6544 to 
bolster our energy security and drive innovation through the atomic 
energy industry.

                 CRIMINALIZING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, recently Speaker Johnson and most 
House Republicans cosponsored a bill that could ban IVF nationwide and 
criminalize reproductive healthcare. The Alabama Supreme Court's anti-
IVF ruling is consistent with these extreme attempts to steal women's 
freedom to decide when, how, and if to have a family.
  Trump and the MAGA extremists want a Federal abortion ban. Packing 
the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade wasn't enough for them. Every 
State law and constitutional amendment protecting women's reproductive 
freedoms from New Mexico to Kansas to Ohio could be overturned if 
Donald Trump and Republicans win in 2024.
  Criminalizing pregnancies, outlawing IVF and birth control, and 
forcing pregnancies on children who have been raped--that is the 
nightmare we face unless women and those that love them act now to 
defeat this extremism. Women need healthcare, not handcuffs.

               RECOGNIZING COMMAND SERGEANT CORY M. BELL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a Pennsylvania 15th District native, Command Sergeant Cory M. Bell for 
his service to the United States of America.
  Command Sergeant Bell is retiring as a master sergeant after 24 years 
of serving in the United States Army. He was raised in Eldred, McKean 
County, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the Army on August 24, 2000.
  After completing his One Station Unit Training at Fort Leonard Wood, 
Missouri, he became a 12B combat engineer. Over the next 24 years, 
Command Sergeant Bell's service took him around the United States and 
the world in a variety of posts and positions. He is currently serving 
in the 3-393rd Brigade Engineer Battalion at Fort Cavazos, Texas.
  Regardless of location, Command Sergeant Bell consistently provided 
leadership and guidance to his fellow soldiers.
  Following his retirement, he will return to Kane, Pennsylvania, with 
his loving wife, Kristen, and three daughters.

  Mr. Speaker, we owe Command Sergeant Bell a sincere debt of gratitude 
for his sacrifice, dedication, and courage to our country. On behalf of 
a grateful Nation, we thank him for his service to the United States of 
America. His dedication to our country is admirable. Enjoy retirement, 
you deserve it.

                     ATTACKS ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

  (Ms. MANNING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. 
Wade, we knew extreme MAGA Republicans wouldn't stop with attacking 
abortion rights. We knew they would come for birth control.
  I introduced the Right to Contraception Act to codify the right to 
use all forms of FDA-approved birth control.
  We also knew they would come for IVF. Last week, the Alabama Supreme 
Court decided frozen embryos are children, forcing clinics in Alabama 
to stop IVF treatments.
  Republicans are now scrambling to claim they support contraception 
and IVF. Actions speak louder than words.
  Mr. Speaker, 195 House Republicans voted against my bill to protect 
the right to contraception, and over 120 Republicans cosponsored the 
Life at Conception Act, a bill that uses the same reasoning as the 
Alabama court, that includes no protection for IVF or birth control, 
and would decimate IVF and abortion access nationwide.
  Earlier today, Senate Republicans blocked a bill to protect the right 
to access IVF. They don't care about protecting reproductive rights, 
they care about controlling women's bodies.

   CONGRATULATING MARK BURNS ON RECEIVING LIFETIME AVIATION INDUSTRY 
                              LEADER AWARD

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mark 
Burns, who recently received the Lifetime Aviation Industry Leader 
Award.
  The Living Legends of Aviation Awards was founded in 2003 by the 
Kiddie Hawk Air Academy to recognize notable individuals who 
contributed to the aviation industry.
  Prior to being named Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation's president in 
July of 2015, Burns worked in various areas spanning the company, 
including engineering and customer support. While president, Burns has 
guided Gulfstream during a time of rapid growth, innovation, and 
investment.
  Additionally, Burns sits on the board of directors for the General 
Aviation Manufacturers Association, Georgia Power, and the Corporate 
Angel. He is a board member of the National Air and Space Museum, and 
he is a member of the National Committee for the Performing Arts, 
amongst others.
  Burns is also a proud alumnus of Georgia Southern University, where 
he received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, and from 
there, built a career worth applause and appreciation by Georgia 
residents.
  Congratulations, Mark.

  (Mr. SORENSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, as the only meteorologist in Congress, I 
rise today to honor one of the best in the history of local television: 
Tom Skilling of Chicago's Very Own WGN-TV. He retires tonight after 45 
years in Chicago, tracking storms, blizzards, and tornadoes.
  It wasn't just being a trusted resource on television. He mentored 
hundreds of interns, setting the bar high for generations of local 
meteorologists now serving all over the country.
  For more than 20 years, I have known Tom to be a man of intense 
character with no limitation to his focus on perfecting the craft of 
analyzing, forecasting, and communicating.

[[Page H736]]

  I would not be standing here today without him sharing the belief 
that we are all just neighbors to one another, experiencing the same 
crazy weather together.
  As the kids say, he is the GOAT. I am so proud to stand here and wish 
my friend the best in his retirement. He is the greatest.

                     SERIOUS DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, sometime in the next month, there is going 
to finally be a serious debate on the number of people streaming across 
our border. It may be over an appropriations bill. It may be over an 
aid bill to Ukraine. There are going to be a lot of people who say 
there are other issues more important than this and to just wait a 
little longer to solve the problem at the border.
  We have waited for 3 years to do something at the border as the Biden 
administration has watched the number of people who crossed the border 
every month go from 10,000 to 20,000 to 370,000 people. That is 
unacceptable.
  We had testimony in my subcommittee last week that the people who are 
coming across the border are 3\1/2\ to 4 times as likely to commit a 
crime as the native-born, and we saw tragedy in Atlanta just on that 
topic.
  We know very well, if you talk to people, that all of these people 
streaming across here have to live somewhere and are partly responsible 
for the increase in rental costs that we have across our country.
  We don't want to shut down the government, and we don't want to say 
no more aid to Ukraine, but we have no choice. If it is not now, when? 
We have waited 3 years.

                        HONORING CALE YARBOROUGH

  (Mr. FRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Timmonsville, South 
Carolina, native and American legend Cale Yarborough.
  The NASCAR Hall of Famer started racing in Darlington at the soapbox 
derby. From there, he went on to win 83 cup races and became the 
sport's first driver to win three consecutive championships.
  Cale's legacy is reflected not only in his record-breaking career but 
also his role in popularizing NASCAR. When Cale Yarborough was racing, 
America was watching.
  Following his decorated career, Cale bought and operated a racing 
team of his own. He also served the Pee Dee community in South Carolina 
on the Florence County Council.
  We mourn the loss of a true legend, but we remember and celebrate a 
life that was well lived.

                          HONORING JACK BODNER

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of an 
extraordinary serviceman from my district, my hometown, Jack ``Pop-
Eye'' Bodner, who passed away at the age of 102 years old.
  Mr. Speaker, Jack was a well-accomplished member of the United States 
Navy, having earned the European Theater Medal with four stars, the 
Good Conduct Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.
  Three years ago, our office had the honor to present Jack with his 
Combat Action Ribbon for his courageous service during World War II.
  Jack enlisted with the U.S. Navy shortly after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. He served our Nation across the globe. He was involved in 
several military operations, such as the Battle of Gela, the landing in 
Salerno, Italy, and the landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day in a U.S. 
amphibious landing craft.
  Mr. Speaker, his service abroad garnered him the status of knight 
within the Legion of Honour, the highest decoration given by the 
Honorary Consul of France, in recognition of his contribution to the 
liberation of France.
  May Jack Bodner's memory inspire all of us to strive toward courage 
and remind us of the heroes living amongst us. May God bless him and 
his family.

                 BORDER FUNDING TIED TO UKRAINE FUNDING

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, in Ukraine, the real battle for liberty 
grinds on. Vladimir Putin dines on caviar while Speaker Johnson and his 
majority House Conference paralyze our Nation. They refuse to bring up 
the Senate aid bill to provide Ukraine ammunition.
  The Speaker pretends Congress won't fix our southern border so we 
shouldn't arm Ukraine's freedom fighters. Fixing our southern border 
requires Congress to vote for the funds to secure it, yet the Speaker 
refuses to bring up border funding while Ukraine's soldiers face the 
third largest military in the world.
  Courageous freedom champion Alexei Navalny was tortured and 
imprisoned by Putin because he wanted a free nation. He was killed in a 
bitter, frigid, arctic prison colony.
  What an awesome, heroic son of liberty for the future of his 
countrymen and -women. He died for liberty.
  Meanwhile, this House is paralyzed. For shame. History will render 
harsh judgments against those elected officials who do not stand up for 
liberty at its time of severe testing on a continent where 500,000 
American soldiers died in the last century so that our generation could 
be free.
  The Speaker should bring up the Senate bill. Stand tall for liberty. 
Don't shrink from it.

                        RECOGNIZING JOHN MURPHY

  (Mr. LAWLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize an individual who 
has been a beacon of service and steadfast advocate for those in need, 
John Murphy.
  John's service began in the Marine Corps before he ran for county 
legislature and served there for over 40 years.
  John has also committed himself to helping veterans and the 
developmentally disabled community, serving on the board of Camp 
Venture in support of the Venture Foundation for over 40 years, as 
well.
  His work in this space led to many services being provided for the I/
DD community in the Hudson Valley, and his efforts remind us that the 
true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most vulnerable 
members.
  In late 2023, John's other venture, Homes for Heroes, unveiled its 
new Phase II residences at Camp Shanks. This organization, headed by 
John, houses homeless veterans, something all of us in this body must 
continue to focus on.
  I applaud John Murphy, a true hero for heroes, for his decades of 
service and his undying commitment to improving lives.
  His legacy is built on the lives he has changed and the futures he 
has secured. I thank him for his service.

                          ____________________

                 DIRECT VICTIMS OF BIDEN BORDER POLICY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, indeed, a very somber thought is that we 
have three young ladies who are direct victims of the wide-open Biden 
border policy. They are not getting much notoriety for that. They are 
not getting talked about a whole lot.
  Kayla Hamilton, 1\1/2\ years ago, was taken by an illegal immigrant 
in this country. Lizbeth Medina, just this last December, was taken by 
somebody who had overstayed their visa and was here illegally. Now, 
most recently, Laken Riley, who we are starting to hear about a little 
bit, was taken by an illegal immigrant just a few days ago.
  All of this is at the hands of the Biden border policy, which is 
endangering our citizens and causing them to lose their lives. What are 
we going to do about this? What are people doing? Are there protests 
out there? Are there

[[Page H737]]

marches? Is there national outrage? Is there national media coverage?
  I guess we are trying to do that here a little bit tonight because 
the media seems to not want to report this. They want to report other 
things. They don't seem to care about this issue that is affecting 
Americans so negatively.
  Laken, Lizbeth, and Kayla are not forgotten. We are going to fix this 
border. These are not migrants. This is an illegal immigrant invasion 
hurting Americans.

                           Government Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, negotiators in both Chambers continue 
working to ensure the government will not shut down at the end of the 
week. We continue to make very good progress on an agreement, and we 
are very close to getting it done.
  I met yesterday with President Biden, with Speaker Johnson, with 
Leader McConnell, and Leader Jeffries; and we all agree a shutdown is a 
loser for the American people. In a shutdown, costs would go up, safety 
would go down, and the American people would pay the price.
  I am hopeful that the four leaders can reach this agreement very soon 
so we can not only avoid a shutdown on Friday but get closer to 
finishing the appropriations process altogether.
  If our House Republican colleagues of good will want to avert a 
shutdown--if they want to govern responsibly, as they say they do--they 
must resist the centrifugal pull of the extreme hard right who want to 
burn everything down, who openly use the threat of a shutdown to push 
their extreme agenda. They are brazen about it. They are brazen.
  We know what the hard right has been pushing. They want to restrict 
women's reproductive freedoms--we saw the case in Alabama. They want to 
rip apart gun safety laws and reward corporate polluters. Or else, they 
say, they want a shutdown. This is no way to govern.
  If our House Republican colleagues of good will want to do the right 
thing, they must accept a fundamental truth about divided government: 
Republicans cannot pass a bill without Democratic support; it takes 
both sides working together--and ignoring the extremes of the hard 
right--to get anything done.
  I have said this over and over again directly to the Speaker, even in 
my first conversation with him: The only way we will get things done is 
by bipartisanship. And I am proud in our Chamber, not just on the 
supplemental but in bill after bill after bill, we are working in a 
bipartisan way. I am proud of that record. The Speaker should 
understand that.

[[Page S1020]]

  So I am hopeful that soon we will have an agreement for keeping the 
government open beyond Friday's deadline. We will keep working very 
diligently today. And I ask my colleagues to stay flexible and be ready 
to act quickly when the time comes.

                       Alabama IVF Court Decision

  Mr. President, on the Alabama IVF decision, after last week's 
stunningly radical decision by the Alabama Supreme Court jeopardizing 
IVF access, the United States has become an embarrassment to the world 
when it comes to reproductive freedom.
  Even sadder, this didn't happen in a vacuum. The hard-right MAGA 
Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade opened the floodgates 
for Republicans to force their anti-reproductive freedom--their anti-
women agenda--down the throats of all Americans.
  The decision by the Alabama Supreme Court is as cruel as it is 
enraging. There are countless people today who have the joy of children 
because of IVF. But now, families have to worry that this option could 
be taken away.
  Make no mistake, Republicans own the consequences of the Alabama 
Supreme Court's decision. Republicans know it. That is why Republicans 
are scrambling, desperate, to backpedal and try to sound reasonable and 
supportive of IVF all of a sudden, because they see what they have 
done.
  Republicans in Alabama--even a conservative State like Alabama--are 
now trying to save face by introducing legislation they claim will 
protect IVF providers. Even they know how the American people are 
reacting to this terrible decision--even in Alabama.
  Republicans in Florida are now trying to save face by postponing the 
consideration of anti-abortion legislation. This is the State that said 
no abortions after 6 weeks, when most women don't even know they are 
pregnant. And, by the way, the popularity of the Governor has 
dramatically dropped after he passed that legislation, because 
Floridians don't like it.
  Even Republicans here in Washington are trying to save face by 
putting off the introduction of national abortion bans because they 
recognize the mess they have gotten themselves into.
  And, of course, they are not fooling anyone. Republicans are like the 
arsonists who set the house on fire and then said: Why is it burning? 
Amazing, confounding, perturbing, and sad.
  Let me be clear: Republicans spent decades calling for a national 
abortion ban. Republicans spent decades packing our courts with hard-
right MAGA reactionary judges. So Republicans deserve zero benefit of 
the doubt now that the consequences of their agenda are sinking in and 
even spreading.
  Republicans can do and say all they want to try and run away from the 
truth, but the American people are not buying it. They are not buying 
it today. They won't buy it tomorrow. They won't buy it come November.
  Democrats remain absolutely committed to doing everything--
everything--we can to protect women, families, reproductive freedom.


                   30th anniversary of the brady bill

  Mr. President, back when I introduced the Brady bill, I was a House 
Member representing Brooklyn and Queens. I knew firsthand the terrible 
toll of gun violence because the streets of my district--and so many 
other districts--were witness to it. So I jumped at the opportunity to 
work alongside two brave and stalwart people, Jim and Sarah Brady--two 
American heroes whose lives, of course, were forever changed by gun 
violence--to help write and pass the Brady Law.
  Looking back at the legacy of the Brady bill after three decades, 
there is no doubt it has saved countless lives. There is no way to 
count because you don't know who didn't get the gun who would have, but 
it is going to be a number with many, many zeros. And it paved the way 
for future gun safety legislation, like the bipartisan bill we passed 2 
years ago.
  The bipartisan gun safety legislation we passed in 2022, in fact, was 
the most significant and comprehensive action on gun safety since the 
Brady bill. And just like its predecessors, it, too, is already saving 
lives.
  But it shouldn't take an assassination attempt against a President or 
a mass shooting among these innocent children in elementary school for 
elected leaders to make change happen. Gun violence is one of America's 
greatest ills. But it shouldn't have to be that way. And so our work, 
thinking of Jim and Sarah hovering over us, is far from over.
  Democrats remain committed to combating gun violence and making our 
communities safer. And we will keep pushing. We will keep fighting. We 
will never let the grief of parents and kids and neighbors and 
teachers--and all of those who have been scarred by gun violence--to 
recede to the back of our memories.
  Again, a salute to Jim and Sarah Brady and what they have done for 
America.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                                Ukraine

  Mr. President, on Ukraine, the meeting I had yesterday with President 
Biden and congressional leaders over Ukraine was one of the most 
intense discussions I have ever had--or witnessed--in the Oval Office.
  Every single one of us yesterday understood the basic facts: The 
situation in Ukraine is getting increasingly dire. Russia has made a 
major advance by taking the city of Avdiivka, which they did simply 
because Ukraine was running short of ammo and long-range artillery 
basic equipment. It wasn't the lack of the will of the fighters. It 
wasn't the lack of plan. It was, simply, that they ran out of 
ammunition. Imagine being a brave soldier fighting for freedom, 
fighting for your country, and you no longer have the ammo.
  Without more aid from the United States, Ukraine will lose. In fact, 
one American leader over there told me that he wouldn't be surprised if 
Russian tanks were on the Polish border if we didn't give any aid. What 
kind of legacy would that leave for the House Republicans who seem to 
want to stall that aid? It is not all of them, of course, but too many.
  Everyone in the room, with the exception of the Speaker, agreed that 
Congress must finish the work on the supplemental ASAP because the 
future of Ukraine and the West is at stake. Speaker Johnson said he 
wants to continue to think it over.
  I was candid with the Speaker that I hope he gives it careful thought 
because the eyes of history are upon him.
  I said to the Speaker: If you are the one stopping Ukraine aid, then 
no matter what the consequences may be in the short term, you will 
regret your decision 2 years from now and could potentially regret it 
for the rest of your life, because this will be remembered as a turning 
point in America for our strength, our credibility on the world stage, 
for our national security.
  If we don't provide this aid, every year the United States could lose 
out to its enemies: the autocrats of the world, the Putins, the Xis, 
the heads of North Korea, and Iran. We could lose out economically, 
militarily, diplomatically, politically because of a shortsighted 
decision not to provide the much needed aid.
  The Speaker has a legacy-defining decision to make on Ukraine. If he 
lets this bill move forward, he can go down as a fierce defender of 
America's core values. But if he shrinks from the importance of the 
moment, it will be the greatest gift Putin, other autocrats, and 
enemies of our country could possibly ask from the American Congress.

                                 Energy

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been a month since the Biden 
administration announced its de facto ban on new export permits for 
America's abundant stores of natural gas; 1 month since the President 
chose to bring growth in a critical sector of our economy, with 
massive, global consequences, to a screeching halt.
  At the risk of understating things, the condemnations of President 
Biden's decision were swift and full-throated, and it is not hard to 
understand why. With the stroke of a pen, the President threatened the 
livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Americans, from Texas to 
Pennsylvania, who produce and transport natural gas.

[[Page S1021]]

  From the outset, the administration tried to cast the freeze as an 
effort to look out for American consumers, but the facts tell a 
different story. By the Energy Department's own analysis, the United 
States has more than enough natural gas to meet both domestic and 
export demand.
  In fact, if the Biden administration was really concerned about 
access to one of the Nation's most abundant, reliable, and affordable 
energy sources, they would release their stranglehold on domestic 
energy exploration and energy infrastructure. Millions of Americans 
live near massive natural gas reserves but can't reap the benefits 
because the President is afraid of upsetting climate activists by 
investing in safe and efficient energy infrastructure.
  Some of the most scathing criticism of the President's decision has 
come from his own former Democratic colleagues. As former Senator Mary 
Landrieu of Louisiana observed last month, the administration's so-
called ``pause'' on LNG export permits was like ``throwing a match in a 
bale of hay.''
  America's allies and partners already doubt our resolve to deter 
common adversaries, but now the world wonders why the Biden 
administration just handed them a gift.
  Just last week, a German state-owned energy company confirmed that it 
would actually keep an LNG supply contract with Putin. But it gets 
worse. The company had a contract in hand to begin purchasing American 
LNG instead until the administration announced its freeze last month. 
In other words, the President of the United States essentially told a 
NATO ally to keep on enriching the dictator responsible for the first 
major land war in Europe since 1945.
  To make matters worse, it is increasingly clear that President 
Biden's decision had another adversary's fingerprints all over it. 
Leftwing activists have been in the driver's seat of the President's 
energy policy since day one. That much is not news, but his top climate 
advisers taking private meetings with influencers on a Chinese-owned 
social media platform or the campaign to ban LNG permits being driven 
by a private foundation invested heavily in China's funds--that is 
news.
  LNG exports are one of the only areas of U.S.-China trade in which 
the PRC is reliant on the United States. Beijing would be all too happy 
for an excuse to buy less clean U.S. energy and more of what President 
Biden's Energy Secretary called ``the dirtiest form of natural gas on 
Earth''--Russian LNG. Well, it appears that President Biden has given 
our top strategic adversary precisely such an excuse.
  It is hard to understand the President's decision as anything other 
than a compulsive, shortsighted grab for more fleeting praise from his 
activist base. Clearly, it makes no strategic or economic sense. As one 
expert analyst and Deputy National Security Advisor under the previous 
administration put it, ``Our partners and allies are baffled and [our] 
adversaries are pleased. That's never a good formula.''

                       Colleges and Universities

  Mr. President, on another matter, 3 days ago, a member of Harvard's 
anti-Semitism task force stepped down over concerns the university 
would not actually implement the group's recommendations. 
Unfortunately, if recent events are any indication, this professor's 
concerns about the unchecked wave of hate on campus are well-founded.
  A few weeks ago, multiple Harvard student groups circulated a 
blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon of Muhammad Ali and former Egyptian 
President Nasser being hanged by a hand bearing a Star of David with a 
dollar sign at its center. True to form, the university's response 
amounted to a sternly worded letter.
  Not to be outdone on this backslide into brutish hate, fliers were 
found on Columbia's campus depicting an Israeli flag in the shape of a 
skunk. A Columbia Law School student senate rejected a proposal from 
fellow students seeking to form a club to combat anti-Semitism.
  By now, it is also painfully clear that the moral failures of campus 
administrators go well beyond weak responses to student behavior. 
Rutgers recently hosted an event with a professor who described the 
events of October 7 as ``awesome scenes . . . witnessed by millions of 
jubilant Arabs.'' City University of New York tried to schedule a panel 
titled ``Globalize the Intifada.''
  As the glaring moral rot on college campuses invites scrutiny, even 
further evidence of decline has emerged. Not only are some of the 
Nation's most elite institutions breeding grounds for the world's 
oldest form of hate, they are also infested with academic misconduct.
  Last month, Harvard's chief diversity officer was found to have 
copied her husband's work extensively without citation, and perhaps 
even more shockingly, a top neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School 
was found to have falsified data in 21 different papers--profoundly 
unserious behavior at a university that professes world-leading 
academic caliber.
  So it is no surprise to see donors continue to vote with their 
checkbooks. Another prominent billionaire and longtime donor to Harvard 
announced last month that he would end his support. He said that until 
Harvard got back on the right track and focused on educating future 
leaders, he said, ``I'm not interested in supporting the institution.''
  For their part, American families are right to reconsider whether an 
Ivy League diploma is worth the cost--or, for that matter, the hate.
  Unfortunately, the Biden administration isn't making it any easier 
for students and parents to make informed decisions. Beginning with the 
failure to launch last fall, the Department of Education was slow to 
post the Free Application for Federal Student Aid online. Now, months 
behind schedule, prospective students and parents are stuck with 
incomplete information on the cost of attending college.
  But while the Department is slowing down and muddling the financial 
aid process, they are simultaneously speeding up their student loan 
socialism scheme rollout. It is almost as though the Biden 
administration wants more young people to incur excessive debt so that 
they can turn around and force taxpayers to foot an even larger bill to 
bail them out.
  Not only has the Supreme Court ruled President Biden's student loan 
socialism unconstitutional, the scheme is also profoundly bad policy, 
and it won't help American families struggling to afford college. 
Heaping billions of dollars of student loan debt on taxpayers will only 
drive up tuition prices at universities that are failing miserably at 
their most basic responsibilities.
  So perhaps--perhaps--it is time the government followed the lead of 
parents and business leaders and stopped providing taxpayer subsidies 
to institutions that have clearly lost their grip on reality.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

                               Farm Bill

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, America needs farmers and ranchers. We need 
the men and women--and often entire families--who are willing to do the 
hard work to feed our country and the world. In places like my home 
State of South Dakota, farming and ranching are just part of our way of 
life.
  But this important work involves a great deal of risk. Few jobs, for 
example, are as subject to the whims of the weather and fluctuations of 
the market. So, for almost 100 years, Congress has regularly passed a 
farm bill to back agriculture producers with programs and policies that 
mitigate risk and help them to keep going through the tough times.
  And with the 2018 farm bill expiring last year, Congress needs to 
take up this important task once again. And while I am glad Congress 
passed an extension of critical farm bill programs through the 2024 
growing season, a temporary extension is no substitute for a full, 
updated bill.
  I have been able to help craft four farm bills during my time in 
Congress, and, for me, the process always begins and ends with farmers 
and ranchers. In

[[Page S1022]]

addition to my regular discussions with farmers and ranchers as I 
travel around our State, I have held a number of roundtable discussions 
across South Dakota, focused on the next farm bill, to receive direct 
input from our State's agriculture producers, and most of my priorities 
for the farm bill come directly from the conversations that I have had.
  One thing I consistently hear from farmers and ranchers is the 
importance of a farm safety net. Crop insurance, commodity, and 
livestock programs play a critical role in helping producers manage 
risk in their operations.
  Crop insurance is the cornerstone of the safety net, and we need to 
strengthen it wherever possible in the next farm bill. And while crop 
insurance has historically supported row crop production, I am pleased 
with the progress we have made in recent years to improve and expand 
insurance options for livestock producers.
  But commodity programs like Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss 
Coverage need to be improved so that they sufficiently mitigate 
producers' losses. And livestock programs like the Livestock Forage 
Disaster Program and the Emergency Assistance for Livestock Program 
need to be modified to improve the assistance that they provide and 
make them workable for producers.
  So one of my top priorities for the next farm bill is improving 
commodity and livestock programs so they provide the support that 
farmers and ranchers need during tough times.
  As I said, while I am glad we have extended key provisions of the 
2018 farm bill through this growing season, we are overdue for a full, 
updated, multiyear farm bill, and Republicans on the Agriculture 
Committee are ready to get to drafting a bill.
  I am disappointed, however, that some of my Democrat colleagues don't 
seem to share our sense of urgency.
  The Biden administration and congressional Democrats have put funding 
their climate and nutrition priorities ahead of helping farmers and 
ranchers, which has stalled what has traditionally been--traditionally 
been--a bipartisan farm bill process.
  With an expected $1.5 trillion pricetag for the next farm bill--
thanks in part to the Biden USDA's SNAP Thrifty Food Plan update, which 
is expected, by the way, to cost more than a quarter of a trillion 
dollars over the next 10 years--there needs to be some give and take 
when it comes to meaningfully funding the farm safety net and other 
components of the farm bill.
  Since the last farm bill passed in 2018, farmers and ranchers have 
faced a number of challenges. Inflation has driven up farm production 
expenses by $100 billion since the last farm bill. USDA is forecasting 
another decrease in net farm income this year, following last year's 
drop. And farm input costs are projected to stay near record highs this 
year.
  The Biden administration's failure to promote trade and new market 
access opportunities will continue to negatively impact farmers and 
ranchers in their bottom lines. This year, the United States is on 
track to post a record-high agriculture trade deficit, and recent 
disruptions to shipping in the Middle East could have impacts on global 
markets that negatively affect American farms and ranches.
  Our focus needs to be on helping farmers deal with these challenges. 
Simply put, we need to put more farm in the farm bill, and we need to 
get moving now.
  America's farmers and ranchers can't afford more unnecessary delays 
or partisan exercises. It is time to get the farm bill done and done 
right.

                            Border Security

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tomorrow President Biden will do something 
he has done only once before in his term as President of the United 
States, he will travel to the U.S.-Mexico border to Brownsville, TX, in 
an attempt to address his biggest political liability. Since the 
President took office 3 years ago, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
has logged more than 7.2 million migrant encounters at the southern 
border. By that, we mean people who have shown up at the border and, by 
and large, have simply been released into the interior based on an 
initial claim of asylum which has yet to be put in front of an 
immigration judge. And it may be as long as, in places like New York, 
10 years in the future before they ever get in front of an immigration 
judge; or, as we have seen tragically here most recently, these 
migrants will be paroled or simply released into the interior of the 
country--even without a claim of asylum--given a work permit, and stay 
here indefinitely.
  Mr. President, 7.2 million is higher than the total number of 
migrants who came across the southern border under President Obama, who 
served 8 years, and President Trump, who served 4 years. So the Biden 
administration has done in 3 years what it took 12 years for the two 
previous administrations to accomplish. We have experienced more 
illegal immigration in the last 3 years than in the last 12.
  The American people have become increasingly concerned at the 
southern border because they see with their own eyes that this is a 
humanitarian crisis, and it is a public safety crisis. And they 
overwhelmingly--and quite appropriately--blame Biden administration 
policies and the President himself. They see that his policies and his 
rhetoric, rather than deter illegal immigration, have actually 
encouraged it.
  Let me say that again: They understand that the policies of this 
administration and the rhetoric that has been used are the driving 
force behind America's most serious border crisis in history.
  But, as usual, the President refuses to accept any responsibility. He 
has tried to blame everybody but himself. He has blamed congressional 
dysfunction. He has blamed MAGA Republicans. He has blamed anybody and 
everybody that he can possibly think of, rather than accept 
responsibility himself. Not only that, he has, at different times, 
claimed that he lacks the tools to fix this crisis. At different times, 
he has claimed that his hands are tied unless Congress passes new laws.
  The problem with that storyline, that narrative, is the facts simply 
don't support it. For one, the suggestion that only Congress can fix 
the crisis implies that Congress created the crisis. I would point out 
the same laws that were in effect during President Trump's 
administration are still in effect during President Biden's 
administration with far different outcomes.
  As each of our colleagues knows, Congress has struggled to pass any 
immigration laws in recent years; and, certainly, it has not passed any 
that would cause the dramatic surge in immigration that began the day 
that President Biden took office. The President was dealt exactly the 
same hand as his recent predecessors. The only difference is he used 
these authorities entirely differently and sent an entirely different 
message.
  As I have spoken before on the floor, the Border Patrol, which are 
the experts on border security, tell me that there are two main drivers 
of illegal immigration: One is push factors, they call it--poverty, 
violence, a desire for a better life. And we understand that. America 
is a nation of immigrants, of legal immigrants.
  But there is also the pull factors, like a magnet encouraging people 
to make the dangerous journey to our border, even in the form of 
unaccompanied children designed to exploit gaps in Biden administration 
policies and permanently reside in the United States.
  Earlier this week, I was surprised by a New York Times article that 
acknowledged the fundamental hypocrisy behind President Biden's efforts 
to shift the blame once again. This is a quote from February 26, 2024, 
the New York Times. David Leonhardt is the columnist. He said, in part:

       Biden is the president, after all, and a president has 
     significant authority to shape immigration policy even 
     without new legislation. Biden himself has been aggressive 
     about using this authority--albeit to loosen immigration 
     policy rather than tighten it.

  So the current phenomenon, this crisis--humanitarian and public 
safety crisis--is as a result of President

[[Page S1023]]

Biden's own policies. It is not the laws that are broken or inadequate; 
it is his will to actually enforce the law and his active encouragement 
for people to come to the border because they know they will 
successfully be able to stay in the United States.

  I have mentioned before about a trip that several of us colleagues on 
a bipartisan basis went to Yuma, AZ, a little sleepy agricultural 
community in southwest Arizona right across the border from Mexico. The 
Border Patrol Chief said: Welcome to the Yuma sector. Last year we 
welcomed people from 140-plus countries--not Mexico, not Central 
America, but from 140-plus countries that speak more than 200 
languages.
  Senator Kelly, our colleague from Arizona, pointed out that there was 
an airport in northern Mexico, in Mexicali--which is a fairly large 
city in northern Mexico--and, apparently, what happens is people fly 
into Mexicali and literally Uber over to the Border Patrol and declare 
amnesty--well, declare ``asylum'' is the right word.
  Well, I know the President will have a hard time with this, his 
second drive-by of the American-Mexico border during his term as 
President, but, of course, his goal is to try to shift the blame once 
again. As this journalist wrote, President Biden is the President. He 
wanted to be President. He got elected President. He ought to do the 
job that Presidents do, which is to enforce the laws. That is what the 
executive branch of government does: Congress passes laws. The judicial 
branch decides disputes about those laws as applied to given facts, but 
it is the President and the executive branch--the Department of 
Justice, Department of Homeland Security--that are responsible under 
our constitutional order for actually enforcing the law.
  And what has President Biden done with that authority? He has 
loosened immigration policy rather than tightened it. This is what I 
have been saying for 3 years; and, even now, I can't tell you how 
surprised and pleased I am to see this stated in the New York Times. 
But President Biden could listen to Mayor Adams, the mayor of New York 
City. He has said: This has been a disaster for New York. You hear the 
similar complaints from people like the Mayor of Washington, DC, the 
mayor of Chicago. These are self-styled sanctuary cities that you think 
would welcome these migrants, but they have been overwhelmed.
  Well, what about 7.2 million that are showing up on our back doorstep 
in Texas? It is hard to have much sympathy for the mayors of New York 
and Chicago and Washington, DC, when they have dealt with just a 
fraction of the numbers that we have had to deal with in Texas without 
any help from the Federal Government.
  And the Federal Government has been actively undermining efforts by 
the State of Texas to reduce illegal immigration.
  During his first few days in office, President Biden signed a raft of 
Executive orders related to immigration and border security: He halted 
construction of the border wall. He dismantled the agreement we had 
with Mexico that migrants could remain in Mexico while they waited for 
their asylum claim to be adjudicated. But he ripped that up too. He 
ended an asylum agreement with Northern Triangle countries and even 
issued a 100-day pause on deportations. So even if you were here 
illegally, you knew, at least for 100 days--and very likely for the 
rest of your life--that you would not be deported because of President 
Biden's policies.
  These are just a few examples of the Executive orders President Biden 
issued within days of taking office. In the 3 years since, he and other 
leaders in the administration have gone to great lengths to roll out 
the welcome mat.
  One of the most egregious examples is the administration's widespread 
use of parole. Parole, in this context, means that is a temporary entry 
for foreigners under rare and dire circumstances. It was never meant to 
be used categorically or in a blanket fashion as the Biden 
administration has done. It is meant to be used on a case-by-case basis 
in extreme cases--someone experiencing a medical emergency at a port of 
entry; somebody is donating a kidney or serving as a witness in a 
trial. It was meant to be used on a case-by-case basis which, by 
nature, gives the administration a good amount of discretion. But to 
provide some comparison, during the two previous administrations, an 
average of 5,600 migrants were paroled into the United States each 
year--5,600. Once President Biden took office, that number skyrocketed.
  The Biden administration has used parole to facilitate catch-and-
release at the border at an unprecedented pace, but its use of parole 
extends beyond illegal crossings at the southern border. The Biden 
administration announced a new program which allows individuals from 
four countries--Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela--to enter and 
remain in the United States, all under the guise of parole. You don't 
need to claim asylum. If you can make it to the border, if you pay the 
smugglers enough money to get you there, you know you are going to be 
able to stay here. This program that the Biden administration set up 
intentionally and with great deliberation provides 2 years of legal 
status and work authorization to 30,000--30,000--migrants from these 
four countries each month. That is 360,000 a year. The Biden 
administration: Roll out the welcome mat. Give them a work permit. Say 
``You can stay,'' knowing that they probably will be able to stay 
indefinitely.
  In total, the Biden administration has used its case-by-case parole 
authority to grant parole to 1.6 million migrants in less than 2 
years--1.6 million. As President Biden has shown repeatedly, if you 
give him an inch, he will take a mile.
  Another example of gratuitous discretion came from Secretary 
Mayorkas, who has been impeached by the House of Representatives. 
Secretary Mayorkas issued a final directive for immigration enforcement 
priorities in the fall of 2021. This really should be called--instead 
of immigration enforcement priorities, this should be immigration 
nonenforcement priorities. That would be a more accurate title.
  But under this guidance--one headline summed up the contents rather 
succinctly. It said the ``U.S. Will No Longer Deport Illegal Immigrants 
Based on Undocumented Status Alone.'' We are not going to deport people 
who are illegally entering the country? What kind of message does that 
send?
  But the memo went on to explicitly discourage ICE officers. ICE is 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Once you get past the border, ICE 
is the one responsible for repatriating or returning people who are 
here illegally. This memo explicitly discouraged ICE officers from 
arresting or removing illegal immigrants unless they have been 
convicted of a serious crime.
  It defies all common sense to ask law enforcement officers, who take 
an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States--it 
makes no sense to tell them at the same time to turn a blind eye when 
you encounter people who are here illegally just because the Biden 
administration doesn't want to enforce the law.
  Secretary Mayorkas went further. He laid out mitigating factors that 
should be considered before arresting or removing illegal immigrants, 
including their age, how long they have been in the United States, and 
the impact the removal would have on their family. Even in the case of 
an alien convicted of a very serious offense, like murder, like rape, 
receipt and possession of child pornography, ICE would have to consider 
these mitigating factors before they could take action and remove that 
person.
  The reality of the situation, no matter how inconvenient it may be 
for our Democratic colleagues, is that by entering the United States 
illegally, these migrants are breaking the law.
  There is nothing wrong with prioritizing the removal of the most 
dangerous criminals. Previous administrations have prioritized certain 
categories of illegal immigrants, like those suspected of terrorism or 
those who could be a threat to national security or public safety. But 
there is a difference between prioritizing certain groups for removal 
and exempting entire categories from enforcement.
  Given everything we have witnessed over the past 3 years, President 
Biden has no right--no right--to claim that

[[Page S1024]]

his hands are tied when it comes to addressing the border crisis by 
Executive action.
  From day one, President Biden made clear that he was willing to use 
Executive action, as David Leonhardt notes here, but he did it to 
loosen illegal immigration, make it easier, not harder. He used 
Executive action to stop border wall construction, end the ``Remain in 
Mexico'' policy, halt deportations, exclude broad classes of migrants 
from removal, parole more than 1.6 million migrants into the United 
States, and so much more. So this is a crisis of President Biden's 
making. This is a manmade disaster, and that man is President of the 
United States.
  If the President believed that he had this much latitude to loosen 
immigration policy, he shouldn't feel constrained by Congress when it 
comes to tightening immigration policy. It would be good politics for 
him. I pointed out that this is a major political liability for the 
President going into an election. He could fix it, just like he broke 
it.
  Executive actions have been used in the past to address migration 
surges--and with a great deal of success.
  Back in 2005, then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff testified before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee that I serve on and spoke about the 
Department's response to a surge of migrants from Brazil.
  All of a sudden, a bunch of migrants from Brazil showed up at the 
border. But what did they do? What did the Bush administration do? They 
used their existing authorities to expand the use of expedited removal, 
which allows agents to quickly remove migrants who have no legal basis 
to remain in the United States. As Secretary Chertoff noted, word 
spread fast. After 30 days, the number of Brazilians dropped by more 
than 50 percent. After 60 days, it dropped more than 90 percent.
  President Biden can do precisely the same thing, but he won't do it. 
President Biden has the exact same authority to replicate that effort 
today. He could expand expedited removal, send a clear message that our 
southern border is no longer an open corridor. But, as Mr. Leonhardt 
points out, all the messages he is sending are ``You can come. You can 
stay.'' What more powerful magnet, what more powerful pull factor for 
illegal immigration can you imagine?

  As I pointed out time and time again, it is not just about illegal 
immigration; it is about the drugs, because the cartels have figured 
out that if you flood the border with people, you can overwhelm the 
Border Patrol. Many of them would have to leave the frontlines to 
process paperwork, provide transportation, food, shelter, clothing to 
migrants in order to treat them humanely while they are here, but they 
are not on the border.
  Last year alone, 108,000 Americans died from drugs that come across 
that border, 71,000 of them from fentanyl, the synthetic opioid pressed 
into counterfeit-looking pills that high school-age children are taking 
across the country, thinking that they are taking something relatively 
innocuous, but, in fact, it kills them. Fentanyl is the leading cause 
of death for young people between the ages of 18 and 45. We know where 
it comes from. It comes across that border. It is manufactured in 
Mexico from precursors shipped in from China. But that is part of the 
disaster that the Biden administration's open border policy has 
wrought--108,000 dead Americans last year alone.
  Well, news reports are that President Biden could announce new 
Executive actions on his trip to the border tomorrow. I am eager to see 
whether he will reverse course and issue an Executive order that will 
actually tighten the border or actually do his duty of securing the 
border or whether these are measures more designed to loosen 
immigration policy.
  Of course, I expect that the American people, being very smart, will 
understand why President Biden has chosen this time to take this trip--
the second driveby of the border since he has been President. It is all 
about the election in November, and he understands that this is a 
gaping political liability, and he is trying to plug that. Not only is 
he trying to plug that hole, he is also trying to blame others for his 
failure, and that will not work. The American people, being very smart 
and perceptive, can see through that smoke screen.
  I yield the floor.
  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled 
rollcall vote begin immediately.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.

                      Senate Republican Leadership

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as some of you may know, this has been 
a particularly difficult time for my family. We tragically lost 
Elaine's younger sister, Angela, just a few weeks ago.
  When you lose a loved one, particularly at a young age, there is a 
certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process. Perhaps it 
is God's way of reminding you of your own life's journey to 
reprioritize the impact on the world that we will all inevitably leave 
behind.
  I turned 82 last week. The end of my contributions is closer than I 
would prefer.
  My career in the U.S. Senate began amidst the Reagan revolution. The 
truth is, when I got here, I was just happy if anybody remembered my

[[Page S1025]]

name. President Reagan called me Mitch O'Donnell. Close enough, I 
thought.
  My wife Elaine and I got married on President Reagan's birthday, 
February 6. It is probably not the most romantic thing to admit, but 
Reagan meant a lot to both of us. For 31 years, Elaine has been the 
love of my life, and I am eternally grateful to have her by my side.
  I think back to my first days in the Senate with deep appreciation 
for the time that helped shape my view of the world. I am unconflicted 
about the good within our country and the irreplaceable role we play as 
the leader of the free world. That is why I worked so hard to get the 
national security package passed earlier this month.
  Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular 
moment in time. I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not 
one of them.
  That said, I believe more strongly than ever that America's global 
leadership is essential to preserving the shining city on a hill that 
Ronald Reagan discussed. For as long as I am drawing breath on this 
Earth, I will defend American exceptionalism.
  So, as I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to 
the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and 
peace about the sunset of my work, a moment when I am certain I have 
helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. That day arrived 
today.
  My goals when I was narrowly elected to the Senate in 1984 were 
fairly modest: Do a good job for the people of Kentucky and convince 
them that, by doing so, they might rehire me for a second term. That 
was it. That was the plan. If you would have told me, 40 years later, 
that I would stand before you as the longest serving Senate leader in 
American history, frankly, I would have thought you had lost your mind.
  I have the honor of representing Kentucky in the Senate longer than 
anyone else in our State's history. I just never could have imagined--
never could have imagined--that happening when I arrived here in 1984 
at 42. I am filled with heartfelt gratitude and humility for the 
opportunity.
  But now it is 2024. I am now 82. As Ecclesiastes tells us, ``To 
everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under 
Heaven.''
  To serve Kentucky in the Senate has been the honor of my life. To 
lead my Republican colleagues has been the highest privilege. But one 
of life's most underappreciated talents is to know when it is time to 
move on to life's next chapter.
  So I stand before you today, Mr. President and my colleagues, to say 
this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate. I am not 
going anywhere any time soon. However, I will complete the job my 
colleagues have given me until we select a new leader in November and 
they take the helm next January. I will finish the job the people of 
Kentucky hired me to do, as well, albeit from a different seat. And I 
am actually looking forward to that.
  So it is time for me to think about another season.
  I love the Senate. It has been my life. There may be more 
distinguished Members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt 
there were any with more admiration for the Senate. After all this 
time, I still get a thrill walking into the Capitol and especially on 
this venerable floor, knowing that we--each of us--have the honor to 
represent our States and do the important work of our country.
  But Father Time remains undefeated. I am no longer the young man 
sitting in the back, hoping colleagues would remember my name. It is 
time for the next generation of leadership.
  As Henry Clay said in this very body in 1850, ``The Constitution of 
the United States was not made merely for the generation that then 
existed, but for posterity--unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual 
posterity.''
  So time rolls on. There will be a new custodian of this great 
institution next year. It won't surprise you to know I intend to turn 
this job over to a Republican majority leader. I have full confidence 
in my conference to choose my replacement and lead our country forward.
  There will be other times to reminisce. I am immensely proud of the 
accomplishments I have played some role in obtaining for the American 
people. Today is not the day to discuss all of that because, as I said 
earlier, I am not going anywhere anytime soon.
  There are many challenges we must meet to deliver for the American 
people, and each will have my full effort and attention.
  I still have enough gas in my tank to thoroughly disappoint my 
critics, and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm with which they 
have become accustomed.
  So to my colleagues, thank you for entrusting me with our success. It 
has been an honor to work with each of you. There will be plenty of 
time to express my gratitude in greater detail as I sprint toward the 
finish line, which is now in sight.
  I yield the floor.
  (Applause, Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I just want to very briefly recognize my 
good friend, the Republican leader, for his extraordinary service, not 
only to our caucus but, more important, to the Senate as an institution 
and to our country.
  His tenure as leader will be remembered, not just for its historic 
longevity but also for his unparalleled devotion to this great 
institution, which he has always defended.
  I also admire the leader for stepping forward when it wasn't popular 
to do the right thing for our country and for our world.
  There will be plenty of time for all of us to honor him in more 
detail as time goes on, but I felt compelled to speak today to thank 
him--to thank him--for devoting his life to public service for all the 
right reasons: to improve the lives of the people living in our great 
country.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.

                            Border Security

  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President:

       I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and 
     defend the Constitution of the United States against all 
     enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith 
     and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation 
     freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
     and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of 
     the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.

  That is the oath that we all take once we become Senators of the 
United States.
  Just imagine that you are Allyson and John Phillips. Last Thursday 
afternoon, you get a phone call from law enforcement in Athens, GA. The 
voice on the other end of the phone says that your daughter has been 
murdered by an illegal immigrant. I cannot imagine what that feels 
like. I cannot even begin to understand the shock and sadness and 
anger.
  Laken Riley was a nursing student at Augusta, GA, this past year. On 
Wednesday morning, she went out for a jog on the campus of the 
University of Georgia. She never came back. Police found her body in 
the woods a few hours later around noontime. She was covered with blood 
and injuries from head to toe.
  An autopsy found that she died of blunt force trauma to the head. The 
charging documents in this case say that her skull was disfigured. This 
was a brutal murder of an innocent young woman.
  Laken Riley was just 22 years old. She had her whole life ahead of 
her. She had a bright future. Now that future will never be realized.
  You know, I spent 40 years of my life on college campuses. I have 
dedicated my life to coaching young adults, but I wasn't just a coach; 
I was also a mentor. There is nothing more heartbreaking than losing a 
promising young person like Laken Riley, and I want to offer my 
condolences to the Riley family.
  Our No. 1 commodity in this country is our young people. Laken's 
death is even more heartbreaking because it could have been prevented 
and should have been prevented. On Friday night, police arrested and 
charged Jose Antonio Ibarra with malice murder, felony murder, 
aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, 
and hindering a 911 call.
  Jose Ibarra is an illegal immigrant from Venezuela. In other words, 
he should never have been in this country in the first place. This 
brutal and horrific murder would have been prevented

[[Page S1026]]

if Joe Biden and Democrats had done their job by enforcing the law.
  Jose Ibarra crossed the southern border in El Paso in September of 
2022, a year and a half ago. He was paroled into our country, and I 
will talk about parole here in just a minute. His social media accounts 
show that he went from El Paso to New York City. New York is a 
sanctuary State and city. That means that illegals who commit crimes 
will not be turned over to the immigration police when their jail time 
is up.
  This is an open invitation by New York City to criminals. We have a 
lot of these sanctuary cities in our country today. According to ICE 
immigration police, he was arrested just 5 months ago in New York, 
charged with acting in a manner to injure a child and for driving 
without a license. Specifically, he was arrested for allegedly 
endangering a 5-year-old child, 5 months ago.
  Athens police called the murder of Laken Riley a crime of 
opportunity. In other words, this was, essentially, a random act of 
violence. It could have been anyone's daughter. She did absolutely 
nothing wrong.
  So my question is: Where are Georgia's Senators today? What are 
Georgia Senators doing to secure the border, to protect more people 
like Laken Riley? Where is their outrage? Soon, the Senate will hold a 
trial on articles of impeachment against Secretary of Homeland Security 
Mayorkas, the guy that is in charge of our border.
  Georgia Senators, how are they going to vote when the trial comes up? 
Are they going to vote for Secretary Mayorkas since he has been 
impeached in the House? Because he is the one that let this killer in.
  Are Senators from border States like California and Arizona going to 
save Mayorkas' job, the job that he has refused to do for the last 3\1/
2\ years? We will find out and find out soon.
  In the House, every single Democrat fell in line and voted--and voted 
to save Mayorkas' job just a few weeks ago, every single Democrat--and 
the guy hasn't done his job in 3\1/2\ years.
  Every single House Democrat endorsed the job that Secretary Mayorkas 
is doing; that includes five Democrats from the State of Georgia where 
Laken Riley was killed.
  In a separate vote, 150 House Democrats voted against deporting 
illegals who had been convicted of drunk driving.
  Mr. President, 150, all Democrats, voted against deporting illegals 
if they got caught drunk driving. That includes all five of Georgia's 
Democrats in the House.
  This is today's Democrat Party, and I go back to the oath that we all 
took to protect domestic and foreign, to protect.
  Are Senate Democrats going to put their political careers on the line 
by continuing to support the least popular President in modern history, 
who has not done his job at the border? We will soon find out.
  Or are they going to stand beside somebody who has broken the law? If 
Laken Riley were my daughter--if Laken Riley were my daughter, 
Secretary Mayorkas would have a lot more to worry about than a pending 
impeachment trial. He would need to go into hiding. It is embarrassing 
to this country of how these people are holding people accountable 
under the law.

  I would do everything in my power to ensure he never forgot her name 
and that his inaction led to her death. Blood is on his hands.
  I cannot possibly understand what this family is going through today. 
But for open borders--all the open-border crowd--she is just collateral 
damage, just somebody else that has been murdered. It won't be talked 
about again. Don't worry about it. All we care about is votes. All we 
care about is power.
  To Democrats in this administration, Laken Riley is just another 
sacrifice on the altar of woke ideology. The blame for this crime lies 
with this administration and with the Democratic Senate majority. 
Democrats run Washington right now. The buck stops with them. They 
uphold the laws.
  Democrats could have stopped this if they would have secured the 
border, if they had done their job. But they have utterly refused for 
the last 3\1/2\ years.
  In fact, this administration has done exactly the opposite. This is 
globalism. This is putting the interest of other countries ahead of our 
own country, our own people, our own citizens.
  Joe Biden has effectively erased our southern border--we don't have a 
border--and has invited the world in with no oversight or plan to 
figure out who is here and why.
  I have been talking about this issue since I was elected to office 3 
years ago. Nearly every American--excuse me. Nearly every Republican 
has been talking about it in both the House and the Senate.
  I haven't seen Georgia Senators down here on the floor sounding the 
alarm on the southern border, not one time in the last 3\1/2\ years. I 
haven't seen California Senators giving speeches about the border and 
why is it open, because they are being overrun. I haven't seen Arizona 
Senators down here giving speeches on the border: You have got to help 
us. Let's close the border.
  I haven't seen that. I am not sure I have seen one Democratic Senator 
on this floor in the last 3\1/2\ years talking about the open borders 
that we have--not one.
  This is the biggest problem facing our country by far. President 
Biden says it is climate change. You have got to be kidding me.
  Democrats don't want to talk about this. Republicans have tried to 
fix the problem.
  I introduced the Border Safety and Security Act, which would close 
the border until the Federal Government regained control of operations 
along the southern border. I have sponsored legislation like H.R. 2, 
which is the best border security bill that we have had. I have offered 
more than 50 border amendments to the recently passed national security 
supplemental bill--any one of them which would have helped fix the 
border crisis.
  Democrats have blocked me and the Republicans at every turn. They are 
the majority of the Senate, and they control the floor. I understand 
that.
  A few week ago, we almost took up a so-called border bill from 
Senator Schumer and Senator Murphy. They worked on it for months. For 
months, they worked on it--embarrassing. It was more of a border 
giveaway--a border giveaway--than a border bill.
  This would have not stopped the deaths of these young people. It 
would not have stopped and prevented the death of Laken Riley.
  Unbelievably, the senior Senator from California actually opposed it 
for being too conservative. The people of California are suffering 
because of a wide-open border, just like all the people across our 
country.
  I will just mention a few, starting in California. Last May, an 
illegal alien named Carlos Dominguez stabbed three people in Davis, CA. 
Two of them died, David Breaux and a student named Karim Najm. A third 
person was stabbed but survived, named Kimberlee Guillory. The alleged 
attacker in this case, Carlos Dominguez, came here in 2009 as an 
unaccompanied minor. He just had his first preliminary hearing in court 
this past week. Where is the outrage from the California Senators about 
the death and the stabbings of these people?
  Let's talk about Arizona. Last year a young man named Harly Sellers 
was killed by a drunk driver in Fountain Hills, AZ. The alleged drunk 
driver who killed him is named Hilario Ortiz Cruz. He is an illegal 
alien who had previously been deported in 2013.
  It is a felony to reenter this country after being deported. A lot of 
people don't realize that, but it is. We don't go by many laws anyway.
  Harly Sellers was 29 years old. He was engaged to be married in just 
2 months. That wedding will never happen. Harly Sellers left behind two 
young children, including a 1-year-old baby named Carter. Carter will 
never know his dad.
  This was a crime that could have and should have been prevented. 
Where are the Senators from Arizona? Where is their outrage? The 
silence is deafening.

  Part of the blame for this crime falls on this city, here in 
Washington, DC. This city should be blamed because we make the laws, 
and we push the laws.
  Just a couple of weeks ago in Texas, a 16-year-old girl named Lizbeth 
Medina was killed in her own bedroom--just a couple of weeks ago. A 
grand jury has now charged an illegal alien in the case. He is charged 
with breaking into the home and then beating her to death and stabbing 
her.

[[Page S1027]]

  This is happening all across our border. But it is not just limited 
to the border. Every State in our country now is a border State.
  Just last night, people arrested and charged an illegal alien just a 
few miles from this building--just a few miles. It is about a 30-minute 
drive from the U.S. Senate. Police allege that an illegal alien named 
Nilson Granados-Trejo was among a group of gang members who shot at 
another group of gang members. Police say it was all about a drug 
dispute.
  Caught in the middle of the crossfire was a mom and her 2-year-old 
son. That 2-year-old, Jeremy, has died. He didn't have a say about the 
border.
  Nilson Granados has previously been arrested twice for alleged theft. 
The guy that shot this kid right here, twice has been arrested. He was 
subject to a deportation order from a judge in New Jersey, but he was 
released from custody several times, even though immigration police 
filed a detainer. He was never sent back.
  Nilson Granados should not and should have not been in this country. 
He should have never been here in the first place. He should have been 
deported when he was caught the first and second time. Like the judge 
says, this crime could have and should have been prevented. But it was 
not prevented because of Joe Biden's open border.
  Just this week, an illegal alien was arrested in Louisiana for 
allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. He also allegedly stabbed someone 
in the face during an armed robbery a few weeks before.
  A month ago, an illegal alien pled guilty in court to stabbing a man 
to death in Bozeman, MT, in 2022.
  Just yesterday, in my home State of Alabama, in Albertville, police 
arrested two illegal aliens for alleged child exploitation. This goes 
on and on and on. I could have been up here all day.
  Americans are dying due to our open borders at the southern and 
northern borders, and they are dying every single day. Who cares? We 
are worried about a budget here. We are worried about sending $60 
billion to Ukraine. We are not worried about the citizens of the United 
States.
  People are going to wake up, and when they do, there is going to be a 
huge change around here, and I hope it happens.
  Americans are dying due to open borders every single day when it 
comes to drugs, and 100,000 Americans die every year because of drug 
overdose. You would think that would be something that people would 
talk about. Nobody cares. Nobody cares. That is 300 Americans a day 
dying from fentanyl--300 a day. That is like a commercial airliner 
crashing every day.
  Nobody cares. This building doesn't care. Everybody is worried about 
their next election, getting reelected. That is our problem here. They 
don't do what is right.
  The DEA tells us drugs that were brought here over our southern 
border are absolutely destroying the young people in this country. So 
Joe Biden, our President, is going to the southern border tomorrow--
hallelujah.
  This will be only--I want you to think about this. This is a guy who 
has been up here for 50 years. Now, I don't know why. I don't know why 
anyone would want to be up here 50 years to watch what goes on here. He 
has been up here 50 years as Senator, Vice President, and President. 
This is only the second time he has been to the border. And he asked 
why we don't have border policies.
  Well, hell, man, you have been here forever. What did you do while 
you were in office?
  He did zero. His first time ever at the border was last January, 
after 50 years in politics. And he is trying to run for reelection 
again. Good luck.
  He went to El Paso. Border Patrol cleared the streets of all illegal 
camps and immigrants. There was nobody there. He didn't talk to any 
illegal immigrants. He didn't go to the Border Patrol station. He just 
took his picture, walked around with his sunglasses on, had a relaxing 
day, not worrying about the border, not worrying about what is coming 
across the border. He just went down there to have his picture taken.
  Now, the media says he is going to Brownsville, TX, tomorrow to get 
his picture taken. He is going to Brownsville, TX. Yesterday, 12 
illegals come across at the border there.
  You know we have got another President, former President Trump. He is 
also going to the border tomorrow. He has been down there many times. 
He is going to Eagle Pass, TX. Yesterday, there were over 500 that came 
across the border there. No matter what you think about President 
Trump, he actually cares.
  One of Joe Biden's Executive orders was to let asylum officers give 
out asylum at the border without ever going to a judge.
  In other words, when you come to this country, you are supposed to be 
given a time and a day to go see a judge to see whether you get to stay 
here or not. But, in the last 3\1/2\ years, we have been giving asylum 
at the border, giving a piece of paper which has a destination that you 
are going to; put on an airplane and flown somewhere across the 
country, and finding out what you can do to make a living and where you 
can go.
  I know. I was on a plane not too long ago with a planeload from 
McAllen, TX, of illegals that were put on there, on this plane, going 
to cities all over the country. I was on there with them.
  I am watching them come on. I am thinking: You know, it took me 45 
minutes to go through TSA. I got patted down. All my stuff was scanned 
and didn't have anything on.
  They brought them up straight to the plane, opened up the door, and 
let them get on. It was absolutely amazing.
  Why do we need TSA? That is another point.
  Meanwhile, as we are giving out all this asylum, Joe Biden has taken 
94 Executive actions against immigration enforcement since he has been 
in office. In other words, 94 times he says: OK, we don't need this at 
the border. That is my law. That stands. We don't need this one--94 
times.
  Meanwhile, he said we can't do anything to fix the border.
  If you want to fix the border, Mr. President, just take those 94 
Executive actions and put them back somewhere on the shelf, and let law 
enforcement do their job. One of these Executive actions was the abuse 
of the parole system, and I said I was going to say something about 
this.
  (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)
  That is how Jose Ibarra, who killed Laken Riley, got into this 
country. Joe Biden paroled him into the country, meaning he was 
arrested when he got to the border by Homeland Security and then 
released.
  Federal laws say that parole is supposed to be used only on a case-
by-case basis. Why are you here? Why do you need to come here? Full 
information given by the immigrant and should be on a case-by-case 
basis for urgent humanitarian reasons. That is the reason you are here. 
They just wave him on through.
  That is not what Joe Biden is doing. He is not looking into the 
backgrounds of these people. They are just coming right through the 
front door, laughing at us--we have seen the pictures at the border--
and going on.
  Joe Biden is paroling massive numbers of people into this country. We 
better wake up. This is illegal, but Joe Biden is doing it anyway. And 
now Laken Riley is dead. People will forget about her, except for her 
parents and her friends. I mean, we will go on to some other tragedy 
down the road. But we had better wake up. We had better wake up.
  We need to bring back the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. We have to 
bring it back. We do not need more asylum officers. Joe Biden has just 
turned our Border Patrol and our asylum officers into Walmart greeters 
at the border. Again, I have been down there several times, and these 
people need help.
  He is going to go there tomorrow and say: Oh, we need a lot more help 
down here, more secretaries. We don't need law enforcement.
  We don't need any more Walmart greeters. We need a wall. We need to 
bring back the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy, as I said a few minutes 
ago. We need to go back to the policies of President Trump. President 
Trump's policies worked, and the reason Joe Biden changed them is 
because he wanted to do exactly opposite of what Trump was doing. He 
didn't want to give him any credit. Joe Biden has the exact same laws 
on the books that President Trump had, but the difference is day and 
night.

[[Page S1028]]

  Laken Riley's death and the death of every other American caused by 
this border crisis rests with President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas. I 
hope they can't sleep at night, because this could have been prevented. 
We need to go back to the policies that work, stop playing these dang 
games, and stop playing politics. Otherwise, this will keep happening.
  We are here, and we took an oath of office to say we are going to 
watch over the citizens of this country. If we don't do something, more 
Americans will die, more Americans like Laken Riley. More parents will 
be forever scarred for what happened last week. We have to do 
something. We can't forget about this.
  Every time we have somebody who has lost their life in this country 
because of an illegal alien, I am coming back up here and I am going to 
rub it in the faces of the Democratic Party, Secretary Mayorkas, 
Senator Schumer, and Joe Biden. It is 100 percent their fault.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, earlier this month, House 
Republicans impeached Secretary Mayorkas because the Homeland Security 
Secretary refuses to carry out his constitutional duty of securing the 
homeland.
  More than 9 million illegal immigrants, including 1.7 million known 
``got-aways,'' have entered our country under the Biden administration. 
Now, this number is larger than the population of 39 States. At the 
same time, hundreds of individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist have been 
caught on the southern border, including 58 since the start of fiscal 
year 2024. Just in January, there were more than 176,000 illegal 
crossings along the southern border. This is the worst January on 
record. Yet, under Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden, Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement deported just 142,000 people in all of 2023. 
That is less than 5 percent of illegal crossings.
  There is no doubt that this administration has abused both our asylum 
and our parole systems, but unlike asylum--you have parole, which is 
granted by DHS for different reasons, and President Biden has abused 
his parole authority to usher in millions of migrants who are unknown 
to us and who receive both public benefits and work authorizations.
  One thing is clear: The parole system is just another way for the 
Biden administration to circumvent congressional authority and make 
illegal immigrants legal.
  Over the course of four Presidents--go back and look at the years 
from 1983 to 2003--the average yearly total for all paroles was no more 
than 150,000, and on average, the Obama and Trump administrations 
paroled just 5,600 migrants per year. There is a contrast here. In 
2022, Joe Biden paroled nearly 800,000 migrants into the country, and 
in fiscal year 2023, the Biden administration paroled approximately 1.2 
million migrants. That is more than 200 times the number that President 
Obama and President Trump paroled into this country. This 
administration is abusing the parole system and that authority.
  This administration's open border agenda is already having tragic 
consequences. Last week, an illegal immigrant in Georgia was arrested 
for allegedly murdering Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student, 
while she went for a jog on the University of Georgia's campus. The 
suspect should never have been allowed to set foot in America. Yet the 
Biden administration paroled him. They paroled him into this country 
after he illegally crossed our border in 2022.
  There is no doubt that Secretary Mayorkas has breached the public 
trust by making illegal immigration legal, but according to recent 
reports, Majority Leader Schumer is looking for any way he can to 
prevent a Senate trial when the House transmits the Articles of 
Impeachment on Secretary Mayorkas to this Chamber. By tabling the 
Articles of Impeachment, Democrats would be abandoning our core 
constitutional duty to hold an impeachment trial.
  The American people suffer through this administration's border 
crisis every single day, and they deserve an open debate about whether 
Secretary Mayorkas, who has done so much to cause this national 
security and humanitarian catastrophe, is fit to hold public office. 
Based on everything we have seen over the last 3 years, Secretary 
Mayorkas is not fit for office, and if this Chamber upholds its 
constitutional duty, I will vote to convict him.

                         Kids Online Safety Act

  Madam President, late last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee held 
a hearing with the CEOs of five big tech companies--Meta, TikTok, X, 
Snap, and Discord. We did it for a simple reason: Big Tech needs to be 
held accountable for putting profit over children's safety.
  When our children are online on these platforms, they are the 
product. With addictive algorithms, infinite scroll, and endless push 
notifications, social media sites are keeping teenagers on their 
platforms for an average of 8\1/2\ hours a day. It is a disaster for 
the mental health of young Americans.

  But the more time minors spend on these platforms, the more data Big 
Tech can collect, allowing them to rake in billions of dollars in 
revenue. Discord's 2022 revenue, the latest available, was $445 
million. X--their revenue for 2023 is estimated to be $3.4 billion. 
Snap--their 2023 revenue was $4.6 billion. The 2023 revenue for 
ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese Communist Party-affiliated owner, was $110 
billion. Meta's 2023 revenue was $134.9 billion.
  At the same time, big tech companies have turned a blind eye to how 
their platforms are exposing minors to harmful content, drug dealers, 
and predators. But when provided the opportunity to explain themselves, 
the CEOs continued to make excuses for their platforms' failures to 
protect our children online on their platforms.
  During this hearing, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg said he would absolutely 
work with lawmakers to address these problems, but for years, Meta and 
other Big Tech platforms have funded an army of lawyers and lobbyists 
who have fought us on this issue every single day in every single 
possible way. Many of these groups argue that the free market can solve 
this problem, but even though the free market is an incredible force 
for good, it can't stop Meta from putting a lifetime value of $270 per 
teenager who is on their site during their teenage years.
  Still, Zuckerberg claimed that Meta is ``on the side of parents 
everywhere working hard to raise their kids,'' and he wants ``everyone 
who uses [their] services to have safe and positive experiences.'' Yet, 
when questioned about this issue--and it is a vast pedophile network. 
That is not how I termed it; it is how the Wall Street Journal termed 
it in a report. So I questioned him about how this vast pedophile 
network was allowed to grow on Instagram, including content showing 
teenagers for sale to older men. The tech CEO was unable to explain how 
this content does not violate Meta's terms of service and their 
community standards.
  Now, we would think that building out what the Wall Street Journal 
called a ``vast pedophile network'' and having postings showing 
teenagers for sale to older men would indeed violate community 
standards or terms of service, but he could not answer that question. 
Instead, he insisted that his company is not ``perfect''--his choice of 
word. I have to tell you that is a huge understatement.
  Just last month, newly released internal documents revealed that Meta 
executives refused to take action after learning that their algorithms 
connected children with potential child predators. According to the 
documents, which were revealed through a lawsuit brought by the New 
Mexico attorney general against Meta, Meta executives refused to act 
even though they knew about this and knew that 100,000 minors were 
receiving sexually abusive content from adults on their platform every 
single day. Think about those numbers.
  Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that, last year, Meta 
employees warned executives that Facebook and Instagram's paid 
subscription service enabled child exploitation by likely pedophiles, 
but the company pushed ahead with this feature anyway even though they 
knew it was endangering children.
  These are stunning revelations. They corroborate the testimony from 
Facebook whistleblower Arturo Bejar,

[[Page S1029]]

who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last November. 
Bejar is a former engineering director at Facebook. He told us that 
Meta executives knew that millions of teens face bullying, eating 
disorder content, the solicitation of lethal drugs, and sexual 
exploitation on their platforms while they are using those platforms, 
but rather than raise the alarm that their platforms were endangering 
children, company executives withheld this damaging information from 
congressional oversight, rolled back safety tools, and dismantled teams 
responsible for children's safety. In other words, they chose to make 
the problem worse instead of fixing it.
  Why did they do that? Because when our children are on their 
platforms, our children are the product. They are the product. They 
need money. Remember that $270 per-teen amount that they subscribed? 
That is of value.
  So to parents, think about this next time your child is on Instagram. 
Meta sees them as a $270 profit--profit. They put the profit before the 
kids.
  Unfortunately, this isn't just limited to Facebook and Meta. Across 
the board, we have seen social media platforms, including Snapchat and 
the Chinese-owned TikTok, become open drug markets where dealers 
connect with children and sell illicit drugs, including fentanyl.
  We have heard from countless families from across the country who 
have seen their children die from suicide after facing relentless 
bullying on social media. And we have seen digital platforms become 
havens for sex traffickers and child predators who use social media to 
prey on the most vulnerable among us.
  For years, Big Tech companies have made empty promises about how they 
will address the rampant abuse, the malicious content, criminal 
activity on their platforms. But do you know what? Nothing has changed.
  Big Tech has proven they can't police themselves. They won't act. So 
it is imperative that Congress steps in.
  Over the last 3 years, Senator Blumenthal and I have crafted the 
bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act, which would provide parents and 
children with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to 
protect against these online harms. This legislation, which has reached 
a total of 64 cosponsors, includes crucial provisions to hold Big Tech 
companies accountable; mandatory audits to ensure that platforms are 
mitigating harms to children; new tools for parents to identify harmful 
behavior and report abuse directly to these social media platforms; new 
controls for families to support their children, including to opt out 
of algorithmic recommendations. Perhaps most importantly, the 
legislation would create a duty of care for online platforms to prevent 
and mitigate specific dangers to minors, including the promotion of 
suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, and sexual exploitation.
  Without real and enforceable reforms, social media companies will 
only continue to pay lipservice to the issue of protecting children 
while continuing to put profits above their safety. Yes, they need that 
$270 per kid. That is what our children are worth to them.
  Now is the time to bring about some real change. Now is the time--it 
is past time--to hold Big Tech accountable. We have to make certain, we 
have to ensure, our children can be free to be children again.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                             Vladimir Putin

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, when Alexei Navalny died 2 weeks ago, he 
had been in solitary confinement for almost 300 days. Outside his 
window, the Russian dissident and anti-corruption campaigner could only 
see a tall fence and no light.
  Far above the Arctic Circle, the prison was built on the site of a 
Soviet gulag, a place the Kremlin has sent generations of Russian 
citizens to break their spirit. But despite the subzero temperatures, 
despite the months of darkness, despite the violence, Alexei Navalny 
never gave up. He never lost his sense of humor. He never wavered in 
his commitment to fight for a better Russia. And what really bothered 
the Kremlin: He never gave up on telling the truth about Putin. After 
all, he is the one who aptly described Putin's United Russia party as 
``the party of crooks and thieves.'' He saw that Putin is still the KGB 
agent who never turned away from the Soviet legacy that crushed 
rebellion in Hungary in 1956, that suppressed reforms in Czechoslovakia 
in 1968, and that declared martial law in an ultimately unsuccessful 
attempt to crush Solidarity in Poland in 1981.
  There was a chance for Russia to take a different path in the 1990s. 
Many Russians leapt at the opportunity after the collapse of the USSR. 
There were independent political parties. There were open elections. 
There was a free press. Civil society emerged. Russians connected with 
counterparts in Europe and around the world.
  But since his rise to power at the turn of the century, Putin has 
turned Russia in a very different direction, ruling with a regime as 
repressive and corrupt as anything under Brezhnev or Khrushchev. He is 
old-school Soviet. Today, Putin wraps himself in an ideology of White 
Christian nationalism. He has cracked down on ethnic and religious 
minorities. He has persecuted the gay and lesbian community. He has 
shut down independent media and jailed journalists like Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-born 
American citizen who went to visit her ailing mother, and even 
Americans like Evan Gershkovich of the Wall Street Journal, who was 
imprisoned for doing his job as a reporter.
  Vaclav Havel would have recognized these Soviet tactics. He was a 
playwright, a dissident, and of course, later, President of the 
democratic Czech Republic. He wrote in the Washington Post:

       I come from a country where, as late as mid-1989, while all 
     around us totalitarian icebergs were cracking and thawing . . 
     . I was in prison. Yet by the end of that same year, I was 
     elected the president of a free Czechoslovakia.

  Long before that, Havel wrote a famous essay, ``The Power of the 
Powerless.'' In it, he explained that dictatorial regimes are mortally 
afraid of the courageous individual who speaks up for their rights, who 
tells the truth when the regime is telling lies. Havel could have been 
writing about Alexei Navalny.
  The Putin regime is a house of cards built on corruption and 
violence.
  I was in Germany earlier this month at the Munich Security Conference 
when the news of Navalny's death broke. I met with his widow, Yulia, 
who spoke movingly about her husband's death. I wanted to convey 
condolences and demonstrate solidarity with her at a painful time.
  Despite Putin's continuing threats, she is not afraid, and she is 
committed to continuing her husband's mission. His team at the Anti-
Corruption Foundation is not afraid. They still have their list of 
``bribe-takers and warmongers.'' Navalny himself was not afraid. Even 
after they poisoned him and left him in critical condition, he still 
went back to Russia. Courage only begets more courage. That is what 
scares Putin: Navalny was not alone.
  I want to speak briefly about another brave Russian democrat who is 
unjustly imprisoned in Putin's gulag. Only a few weeks after appearing 
before a Helsinki Commission hearing I chaired, they also poisoned 
Vladimir Kara-Murza. Like Navalny, he refused to be intimidated. He 
refused to be exiled from his homeland and returned to Russia time and 
again. They threw him in jail almost 2 years ago for his criticism of 
Putin's unjust war in Ukraine. There are others, too, like Ilya Yashin, 
who was sentenced to 8 years after publishing reports about the war 
crimes by Putin's forces in Ukraine in 2022.
  We in the free world must do everything we can to lift up their 
voices. We must give material support to activists, both inside Russia 
and across the diaspora.
  I was pleased to see the Biden administration levy more sanctions 
against Putin's regime last week, including against the warden of the 
prison, whom Putin promoted to the rank of colonel general 3 days after 
Navalny's death.

[[Page S1030]]

  We must hold those responsible accountable, including using Global 
Magnitsky Sanctions. At the same time, the House of Representatives 
must pass the supplemental funding request to help support the 
Ukrainians fighting against Putin's repression.
  The fight against Putin in Ukraine is also the fight against Putin in 
Russia. This is something Navalny clearly understood when he said:

       Russia must leave Ukraine alone and allow it to develop the 
     way its people want.

  I realize there is a painful sadness for so many across the Russian 
community in the wake of Navalny's death. It is a terrible loss. But 
remember what he told us:

       If they decide to kill me, it means that we are incredibly 
     strong.

  Navalny personified what Havel long ago described as ``the power of 
the powerless.'' So to the friends and family of Alexei Navalny and all 
those in Putin's prisons, to the Ukrainian people fighting against the 
Russian war machine, to the Russian diaspora who still dream of 
returning home, don't give up hope. Have faith that we will one day see 
a peaceful and prosperous and democratic Russia where freedom and 
justice reign.
  I yield the floor.

                        Tribute to Robert Weiss

  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, my colleagues, I come to the floor today 
to celebrate a remarkable man, a really important friend of mine, an 
irreplaceable member of a community that is very important to me. 
Monsignor Robert Weiss--more affectionately known as Father Bob--
retired last month from his post at St. Rose of Lima Church in Newton, 
CT.
  A Florida native, Father Bob was just a teenager when he heard his 
calling to join the priesthood. In 1968, he entered St. Bernard's 
Seminary in Rochester, NY. He was ordained 5 years later.
  His first assignment led him to St. Andrew Parish in Bridgeport, CT, 
and 26 years later, he was assigned to St. Rose in Newton, CT, what 
became his last job in the church. Father Bob gave his final sermon 
just weeks ago.
  I am going to tell you the story in a moment of why Father Bob is a 
household name in Connecticut. He is a hero to many of us, forged by 
fire and tragedy. But that is not the sum of Robert Weiss because 
during his 50 years in the priesthood, he has brought such great joy to 
the people and the families he has served. He is such an easy person to 
talk to. You just meet him for the first time, and you see why it is no 
wonder that over his years of leadership, thousands and thousands of 
parishioners have sought out his counsel and advice, confided in him, 
relied upon him. He has this wonderful smile, a buoyancy to him. He 
will admit that a little bit of that has been robbed from him in the 
last 10 years, but it does just make you feel better just by being 
around him. He is also wise. He has a gravitas about him that he 
carries with him. It just makes you feel safer. It makes you feel cared 
for when you are around him.
  He cares about his church community. He helped grow St. Rose, but he 
cares about the community beyond the church just as heartily. He 
reaches out and builds bridges between religious institutions, between 
church and state, between believers and nonbelievers. He isn't 
judgmental. He is a consensus- and community-builder. He is an 
exceptional leader. That is who he was before December 14, 2012. That 
is who he has been after December 14, 2012. But that is the day, 
whether he likes it or not, that defines his career.
  It started out like any other day for Father Bob. He went to his 
favorite diner in Sandy Hook. He ordered his usual: French toast. He 
was going to spend the morning wrapping Christmas presents. He didn't 
have a mass that day. Then he got a call from the Newton Police 
Department: A gunman had opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
  He told the administrators at St. Rose School, the school affiliated 
with his church, to put the students in lockdown, and then he drove to 
Sandy Hook. He stopped at the firehouse, where parents and teachers and 
kids were waiting. He went to the parking lot of the school. The State 
police officer on the scene asked him if he would bless the children--
the 20 bodies that lay on the floor of that school--and the 6 educators 
who lay on the floor as well, all waiting to be identified. So he stood 
at the front door of that building, knowing that those children and 
those educators were no longer living on this Earth, and he prayed for 
them.
  Then he went back to the firehouse, where he stayed for the rest of 
the day and held the hands of these parents as they waited to find out 
whether their child was in that school dead or somewhere alive. He had 
officiated the weddings of these parents. He had baptized these 
children. These parents had confessed their regrets and their fears to 
him.
  By 3 p.m., Governor Malloy had alerted the families who remained at 
that firehouse about the fate of their children. But Father Bob's day 
wasn't done. He led an impromptu service at St. Rose that evening. 
Senator Blumenthal and I were there. It was maybe the most emotional 
night of my life when Father Bob, with no time to prepare, stood up in 
front of thousands who had come to grieve that tragedy at his church--
because that is where so many of the families belonged--and he told the 
crowd: Evil visited us today, but we have to get through it, and we 
have to find some good.
  Even after the service, Father Bob didn't stop. From there, he joined 
the State police until 1 or 2 a.m. in the morning so that he could be 
there when the final body identifications were made and he could be 
there with the parents when they were given that final, awful, tragic 
news.
  The following week, Father Bob officiated 8 of the 26 funerals. They 
were all students at St. Rose's religious education program. He wrote 
eight homilies. He picked three lessons from each of their short lives 
that the community could learn from.
  It is hard for me to explain to you what Father Bob meant to that 
community in those days, in those weeks and months after. In many ways, 
he was the emotional sponge for that entire community, not just for his 
parishioners. He was so unbelievably generous with himself, with his 
time, and with his heart--in one-on-one time with those who were 
grieving; in big groups who needed to hear some spiritual guidance, who 
needed one of the preeminent religious leaders in the community to make 
sense of what happened; and on television, where Father Bob would speak 
for the community, relieving that burden from so many others who 
weren't yet ready to process and talk about what all of this meant.
  He did it all: the one-on-one hand holding, the group counseling, the 
spokesman for the community.
  The Catholic Church requires bishops retire upon their 75th birthday. 
But when Father Bob's 75th birthday was around the corner in September 
of 2021, he realized he wasn't ready to be done.
  In his resignation letter, he requested a very rare extension to stay 
on at St. Rose of Lima for 2 more years because he wanted to mark the 
10th anniversary of Sandy Hook. He wanted to see through that journey 
the first decade after this tragedy that had ripped a hole in the heart 
of the community that he loved so much.
  I remember talking to Father Bob at that moment when he decided to 
stay on. He acknowledged what he had gone through, how much pain he had 
experienced, how different he was from the man that took that job. But 
he still knew that he had to see that finish line, at least the first 
decade after the tragedy.
  Father Bob may have celebrated his final mass as pastor of St. Rose 
of Lima Church, but he will remain a pillar of this community. We will 
never, ever forget how in the days, weeks, and years after that tragedy 
in Sandy Hook, he led with his heart on his sleeve. He helped heal a 
broken community. More than anyone else, he bore the burden, separate 
and aside from the families who bore the majority of that burden.
  Father Bob's career would have been remarkable even if December 14, 
2012, never happened. But what he did that day, what he did in the days 
and the weeks and years that followed, that makes him a legend.

                    Nomination of Julie Simone Sneed

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Julie Sneed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of 
Florida.
  Born in Fort Lauderdale, FL, Judge Sneed received her B.S. from the 
University of Florida and her J.D. from Florida State University. After 
completing law school, Judge Sneed clerked for Judge Chris W. 
Altenbernd of the Second District Court of Appeal of Florida before 
beginning her legal career as a litigation associate at Trenam, Kemker, 
Scharf, Barkin, Frye, O'Neill & Mullis, P.A. After clerking for Judge 
James D. Whittemore on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District 
of Florida, she continued her litigation career at Fowler White Boggs 
Banker, P.A. and Akerman LLP, where she represented large corporations 
in civil business and commercial litigation in State and Federal 
courts. In 2015, Judge Sneed was appointed to serve as a U.S. 
magistrate judge for the same district to which she is nominated, where 
she has since issued more than 1,000 orders and opinions.
  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Sneed ``well 
qualified'' to serve on the district court, and she has the strong 
support of Senators Rubio and Scott.
  Judge Sneed's deep ties to the Florida legal community, combined with 
her courtroom experience on and off the bench, will make her ready to 
serve the Middle District of Florida with distinction.
  I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.
  Mr. MURPHY. I yield the floor.

                         Texas Independence Day

  Mr. CRUZ. On Saturday, March 2, the great State of Texas will 
celebrate 188 years since we declared our independence from Mexico and 
fought for liberty. In the fight for our independence, many brave 
Texans laid down their lives at the Alamo, including William Barret 
Travis, James Bowie, and Davy Crockett. They risked everything to make 
liberty a reality for generations of Texans to come.
  It is a tradition on Texas Independence Day to read the words of 
Colonel Travis, leader of the besieged forces at the Alamo. His call 
for reinforcements resounded across Texas, across America, and across 
the world, and it reminds us of the bravery of those who fought there 
and died for liberty.
  I have had the blessing to read this letter aloud many, many times, 
and every time, it stirs the spirit and speaks to the heart.

                                     Commandancy of The Alamo,

                                           Bejar, Feby 24th. 1836.
       To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World--
       Fellow Citizens & compatriots--
       I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under 
     Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment & 
     cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man--The enemy has 
     demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison 
     are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have 
     answered the demand with a cannon shot, &

[[Page S1032]]

     our flag still waves proudly from the walls--I shall never 
     surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of 
     Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American 
     character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy 
     is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to 
     three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is 
     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as 
     possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due 
     to his own honor & that of his country--Victory or Death.
                                   [Signed] William Barret Travis.
                                  [Lieutenant colonel commandant].
       P.S. The Lord is on our side--When the enemy appeared in 
     sight we had not three bushels of corn--We have since found 
     in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 
     or 30 head of Beeves.
                                                           Travis.
  At the battle of Santa Jacinto on April 21, 1836, the Texans finally 
secured a decisive victory. We won our independence and formed the 
Republic of Texas, a new nation. Texas was an independent nation for 9 
years before we officially became part of the United States of America 
in February of 1846.
  Sam Houston, the founding father, the George Washington of the Lone 
Star State, was also born 231 years ago on March 2, on Texas 
Independence Day. Sam Houston was an extraordinary American. He was 
born in Virginia. He spent many years in Tennessee, where he served in 
the U.S. House of Representatives and then became Governor of 
Tennessee. In Texas, he led the Texans to victory in the Battle of San 
Jacinto.
  When Texas became an independent nation, Sam Houston served as 
President twice before Texas finally became part of the United States. 
Later, he served in the U.S. Senate and finally as Governor of Texas. 
He is the only man in American history to serve as Governor of two 
separate States.
  Sam Houston was a tireless, talented leader and a great statesman who 
believed in liberty. His words, ``Govern wisely and as little as 
possible,'' still ring true today, and the Lone Star State still 
follows that adage.
  To every Texan, I wish you a gloriously happy Texas Independence Day.
  May God continue to bless the great State of Texas and the United 
States of America.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.

                     Access to Family Building Act

  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, I have been called a lot of names in 
my life: ``Tammy,'' ``Lieutenant Colonel,'' ``Senator,'' and a couple 
others I shouldn't mention in polite company.
  ``Mommy,'' though, is, without a doubt, my favorite name. It is the 
one my 5-year-old uses when she runs into the house after dance class 
and pulls on my sleeve, eager to show me what she learned during her 
lesson.
  It is the one my 9-year-old says when she announces her latest life 
plan. When she was little, she wanted to grow up to be a garbage 
collector; now, she is leaning towards being an Army cyber warrior.
  My girls are my everything. But they, likely, would have never been 
born if I hadn't had access to the basic reproductive rights that 
Americans--up until recently--had been depending on for nearly a half 
century, because after a decade struggling with infertility after my 
service in Iraq, I was only able to get pregnant through the miracle of 
IVF.
  IVF is the reason I get to experience the chaos and the beauty, the 
stress and the joy that is motherhood. IVF is the reason that my 
husband and I aren't just Tammy and Bryan but we are ``Mom'' and 
``Dad.'' IVF made our family. It made my heart whole. It made my life 
full.
  But for countless women in Alabama, that desperately sought-after 
dream of becoming a mom just became so much harder. Last week, that 
State's supreme court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF 
should be considered children under State law--a ruling that paints 
women like me and our doctors as criminals and one that throws IVF 
access into chaos as countless women and doctors try to figure out 
whether they might be criminalized for simply trying to create a 
family.
  If you are thinking that this makes no sense, you are right. You are 
not misunderstanding anything; you are not missing something. It is the 
nightmarish blend of hypocrisy and misogyny that you think it is.
  The very people who claim to be defending family values are the ones 
trying to enact dystopian policies that would prevent Americans from 
starting their own families.
  This is no longer a hypothetical worst-case scenario. IVF providers 
around the State have already paused treatments out of fear that their 
doctors and patients could be punished.
  Organizations that transport embryos to and from medical facilities 
in Alabama have already announced that they will stop doing so, meaning 
that would-be parents there won't even be able to start their families 
in any other States either.
  And now that the first domino has fallen, it seems like it could only 
be a matter of time before more hospitals and more organizations make 
the same call, before more State courts issue similar rulings, before 
more extremist politicians succeed in enacting even more draconian laws 
nationwide.
  Think about that. Think about what is at stake if State courts simply 
can strip away access to IVF. Think about how many would-be moms might 
never be able to hear their child's first little gurgle of a laugh. 
Think about how many hopeful dads might never be able to play tooth 
fairy when his would-be daughter loses her first tooth.
  You know, I lived in Alabama for a bit when I was in the Army, 
stationed at what is now called Fort Novosel. And I didn't know it at 
the time, but infertility would become one of the most heartbreaking 
struggles of my life, my miscarriage more painful than any wound I ever 
earned on the battlefield.
  I also almost lost the opportunity to even try IVF because a doctor 
in a well-known Catholic hospital that my VA hospital referred me to 
told me I was simply too old for treatment; that at 42, I should just 
``go home and enjoy my husband,'' instead, and if it was meant to be, I 
would get pregnant.
  It was pure luck that I found out that that doctor was lying to me, 
that she wasn't basing her advice on medical science but rather on her 
personal religious beliefs, nearly costing me my chance to have my two 
little girls.
  So it is a little personal when a majority male State supreme court 
suggests that people like me who became parents with the help of modern 
medicine should be in jail cells and not nurseries. And I know I am not 
the only one who struggles to understand how elected representatives 
who back these kinds of policies can call themselves members of the so-
called ``party of life.''
  No, rulings like this one and the bills with the same intent that are 
being pushed forward in State legislatures around the country are not 
about being pro-life. They are about catering to an extremist base by 
exerting even more control over women's bodies, inserting politicians 
into some of the most intimate, personal decisions anyone could ever 
make.
  Look, back when I was going through IVF, three of my five fertilized 
eggs were deemed nonviable. If a version of this ruling had been in 
place then, I might have been forced to implant each of those three 
nonviable embryos. I might have been forced to suffer through three 
more miscarriages or else risk me or my doctor being convicted of 
manslaughter for discarding nonviable fertilized eggs.
  That is the kind of extremism that we are talking about here. That is 
the level of cruelty that we are facing. That is the kind of future we 
are fighting to prevent, where frozen embryos have more rights than the 
women who would carry them.
  Let's be clear about what led to this moment, the overturning of Roe 
is what made last week's ruling even possible, as it stripped women of 
a constitutional right, transferring the power to decide whether or 
when to start families from us to politicians in State houses across 
the country.
  Donald Trump is the one who brags about taking down Roe v. Wade. 
Donald Trump is the one who acts as if that is something to be proud 
of. So while it may now be convenient for him to claim that he had 
nothing to do with what happened in Alabama, we know the truth. IVF is 
at risk because of him. He is to blame. Him and every other GOP 
official who shamelessly kisses his ring, proving with every word they 
say that they care more about protecting his poll numbers than 
protecting Americans' freedoms.

[[Page S1033]]

  After Roe v. Wade was overturned--actually, even before then, when 
the Senate was deciding whether to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and Amy 
Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court--I warned that red States would come 
for IVF. And now they have. But they aren't going to stop in Alabama. 
Mark my words, if we do not act now, it will only get worse.
  There are a lot of nuanced tough calls we must make as Senators. 
This, simply, isn't one of them. We know what is right, even if 
extremist courts would like to rob millions of us of our rights. We 
shouldn't need to wait until women and doctors are thrown in jail 
before we act to protect them.
  That is why today I am begging my colleagues to help me pass my 
Access to Family Building Act. A bill that would ensure that every 
American's right to become a parent via treatments like IVF is fully 
protected, regardless of what State they live in, helping guarantee 
that no hopeful parent or doctor in this country can be held criminally 
liable for starting or growing a family through IVF.
  The reality is, one in four married women have difficulty getting 
pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. That number doesn't even 
include partnerless Americans or other families also trying to have 
kids. That is one in four in red States and in blue States, in big 
cities and rural towns, in the wealthiest neighborhoods and in the 
poorest of ZIP Codes, because infertility doesn't discriminate between 
party lines. It doesn't recognize State borders.
  No one should feel that someone else's religious beliefs or partisan 
slants could rob them of their chance to get pregnant, and no doctor 
should have to risk a criminal record just to provide women basic 
healthcare.
  So to my Republican colleagues, please, think about how many that one 
in four equates to in your State. Women willing to go through 
expensive, painful medical treatments just for a chance to experience 
the smallest, most banal moments of parenthood. Just to have a newborn 
to swaddle, a baby whose diaper needs to be changed, a toddler who 
needs their shoes to be tied. And if you believe that they have the 
right to be called ``Mom'' without also being called a criminal, then 
all you have to do to prove it is to let us pass this should-be-obvious 
legislation, because in this nightmarish moment, it is nowhere near 
enough to send out a vaguely worded tweet claiming you care about 
women's rights, despite a voting record to the contrary.
  No, this is where the rubber meets the road. If you truly care about 
the sanctity of families, if you are genuinely, actually, honestly 
interested in protecting IVF, then you need to show it by not blocking 
this bill today. It is that simple.

                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3612

  Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be 
discharged from further consideration of S. 3612 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration; further, that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Reserving the right to object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, I support the ability for mothers 
and fathers to have total access to IVF in bringing new life into the 
world. I also believe human life should be protected. These are not 
mutually exclusive.
  Let's be clear about what the Alabama case is about. This was a case 
brought by families whose human embryos were killed when an 
unauthorized individual walked into the fertility clinic through an 
unsecured door, removed several human embryos, and dropped them, 
causing their deaths.
  The court's holding in favor of the parents found that these frozen 
human embryos are children under Alabama law. It did not ban IVF, nor 
has any State banned IVF.
  The bill before us today is a vast overreach that is full of poison 
pills that go way too far--far beyond ensuring legal access to IVF. The 
act explicitly waives the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and would 
subject religious and pro-life organizations to crippling lawsuits.
  Religious and pro-life organizations could be forced to facilitate 
procedures that violate their core beliefs, including their health 
insurance plans. This would be the first time the bipartisan Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act introduced by then-Representative Chuck Schumer 
was explicitly waived.
  The bill's expansion definition of ``artificial reproductive 
technology'' sweeps in much more than IVF and has far-reaching 
implications. It would legalize human cloning. It would legalize 
commercial surrogacy, including for young girls without parental 
involvement. It would legalize gene-edited designer babies and lift the 
Federal ban on the creation of three-parent embryos. It would legalize 
the creation of human-animal chimeras. Other developed countries like 
Germany, New Zealand, and Australia, as well as States like Louisiana, 
have policies that allow for IVF coupled with commonsense protections 
to respect human life.
  Creating rights to human cloning, the genetic engineering of human 
embryos, and surrogacy is too extreme and goes far beyond IVF. This 
bill misses the mark.
  We should strive to do both, and this bill does not do that. 
Therefore, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Illinois.
  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, I have the greatest respect and 
admiration for my friend from Mississippi, but I have to say that I 
disagree with her interpretation of my piece of legislation.
  This bill does three things and three things only: It protects the 
right of individuals to seek assistive reproductive technology without 
fear of being prosecuted for seeking that technology. It preserves the 
right of physicians to provide that assistive reproductive technology 
without fear of being prosecuted, and it also allows insurance 
companies to cover assistive reproductive technology.
  That is all that it does. It does not force anyone to seek 
reproductive technology; it does not force anyone to offer it; it does 
not force anyone to cover it. It simply says you have a statutory 
right, should you choose to pursue assistive reproductive technology 
that you will be able to do so.
  I also want to note that in Louisiana there is already State law that 
prohibits the ``discardation'' of frozen embryos or of frozen 
fertilized eggs.
  This has already started. In Florida, there is a bill pending before 
the State legislature that would deem that a fertilized egg is a human 
being and provide the opportunity for penalties to be put into 
judgments for those who would discard those fertilized eggs. So this is 
a real threat today.
  With that, I would like to yield to my colleague from Nevada.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.
  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam President, first of all, I want to start off 
by thanking my colleague Senator Duckworth for not only sharing her 
story of her wonderful family and beautiful two daughters--I have seen 
myself what an incredible mother they have, and they are fantastic 
girls. I also have to thank her for bringing forward this important 
legislation.
  Women across the country use IVF to start their own families. You are 
hearing that not only from Senator Duckworth. I have heard it from so 
many people in Nevada and really across the country. They make that 
choice in consultation with their partners, their families, and their 
doctors, not a government official--not a government official.
  There is no logical reason to deny women that right, and yet, after 
Roe v. Wade fell, we could see from a mile away that IVF was in danger. 
Senator Duckworth was one of the first to come forward in recognizing 
that, and that is why her legislation is so important. Why? Because 
attacking IVF was yet another chance for anti-choice Republicans to 
erode women's rights in this country.
  They have introduced a Federal abortion ban that would supersede 
State laws. They have stacked the courts with anti-choice judges. They 
have limited funding to women's healthcare,

[[Page S1034]]

and they have repeatedly ignored the very science behind reproductive 
healthcare in order to push their agenda.
  We knew this was coming. In fact, we tried to do something about it a 
year ago. After Roe was overturned, not only did Senator Duckworth come 
to the floor with her legislation, but we have introduced numerous 
legislation on this floor to protect women's rights. And every single 
time, unfortunately, one of our Republican colleagues comes forward to 
object, without any explanation, but continuing to really erode women's 
rights in this country.
  And I have to say, these extreme GOP colleagues of ours claim to be 
pro-life. They claim to champion family planning. But, really, when it 
comes down to it, they don't support it. You just have to be in our 
communities and listen to the women and their families, and you 
understand that.
  The difference this time around is that the Alabama Supreme Court is 
actually calling their bluff. The threat to IVF is no longer this 
hypothetical. In response to the ruling--and I believe it is an extreme 
ruling from this judge. But in response to this ruling, clinics--some 
clinics in Alabama--have halted IVF procedures. They have halted them.
  I have seen heartbreaking stories of Alabama families who are being 
forced to put their dreams of starting a family on hold, and I am here 
to tell you: It will not stop with Alabama. The consequences of this 
ruling are that not only will it close some of those clinics in Alabama 
that we have heard about, but it will have a chilling impact 
nationally.
  It is one thing to have the legislation that bans it outright, but 
the chilling impact is another barrier. And you don't have to be from a 
State like Nevada. It is a pro-choice State. Listen, if you are 
threatening women, if you are threatening their families, if you are 
threatening doctors who want to help these women, that has a chilling 
effect even in Nevada--even in Nevada.
  These extreme GOP politicians are seeing this, quite frankly, and I 
am watching them, and they are suddenly stuck. They have to decide 
whether to agree with this judge's anti-choice decision or to concede 
that women should be allowed this basic right to choose if, when, and 
how to become a parent. Suddenly, they have to decide just how far they 
are willing to go in their crusade to control women.
  Having a child through IVF is a wonderful thing. It is not a crime, 
and it should not be punished. Our anti-choice Republican colleagues, 
they know this. Yet they have once again refused to do the right thing 
for American families by supporting protections for accessing IVF.
  And let me just finally say that their hypocrisy is on full display, 
and America is watching. You don't have to believe me. Just listen to 
the American public. Across this country, a majority--a majority--and I 
don't care if it is women I hear from. It is their loved ones. It is 
men. I don't care what party you are. I don't care if you are Democrat, 
Republican, nonpartisan. A majority of Americans want women to have 
this right to choose. They want them to have this ability. They believe 
in having families. They believe in IVF. They believe in women's 
reproductive rights.
  And, most importantly, what some of our Republican colleagues are 
doing is inhibiting and limiting women's access to 21st century 
healthcare. That is what this is about. Why should we deny women the 
right to access 21st century healthcare if it is going to save their 
lives, if it is going to help them have families? What is wrong with 
that at the end of the day?
  So I have to thank Senator Duckworth. And it is unfortunate that we 
had an objection to her legislation that is so needed, unfortunately, 
in this day and age, but it is. That is where we are today: fighting 
for women's rights, fighting across this country.
  And, finally, my only other question to my colleagues is: I trust 
women to make this decision. Why don't they?
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, thank you to my colleagues from 
Illinois, from Nevada, and other Senators who are out here to fight for 
the right for women to have basic healthcare services in this country.
  You know, I have said before that Republican attacks on reproductive 
freedom would never stop with Roe. They would never stop with abortion. 
I have said before that IVF was at risk, and now it has been so 
heartbreaking to see that warning become a gut-wrenching reality for 
women in Alabama.
  And it is absolutely infuriating to see some of the same Republicans 
who support so-called fetal personhood bills, who want to codify the 
very ideology in the Alabama Supreme Court decision that ripped away 
access to IVF care, suddenly acting surprised, suddenly acting like 
they had no idea this would happen, suddenly acting like this was 
totally unforeseen, when it is exactly what we have been warning about 
and exactly what the far right has been working toward for decades. 
This isn't some surprise. The Alabama Supreme Court decision is 
Republican ideology in action.
  So spare me the empty statements, especially after the objection that 
we just saw here. Unless you are actually going to work with us to 
protect IVF, save your breath. There are women in Alabama who 
desperately want to start a family, women who have tried for years to 
get pregnant, women who have gone through the heartbreak of 
miscarriage, women who are battling cancer and other devastating 
diagnoses for whom IVF is the only way they will be able to have 
children. And now, after everything they have been through--the hope, 
the disappointment, the thousands--the even tens of thousands of 
dollars it can cost to pursue IVF--after all that, these women have had 
their dreams shattered because Republicans believe a frozen embryo kept 
in storage at an IVF clinic is the same and should have the exact same 
rights as a living, breathing human person.
  That is not hyperbole. That is not hypothetical. That is what is 
happening. You don't have to imagine how painful this is. You just have 
to listen to the women in Alabama who have had their worlds turned 
upside down now by this decision.
  Meghan Cole has a rare blood disease that prevents her from carrying 
children. Her hopes of starting a family through IVF and a surrogate 
were dashed last week when her doctor called to cancel her Friday 
appointment. She asked about transferring the embryos out of the State. 
Even that door has been slammed shut to her.
  Jasmine York turned to IVF after previous ectopic pregnancies left 
her with no other options to have a baby. Now Alabama has left her with 
no options at all. As she said, ``It's completely just derailed a lot 
of hope.''
  Kayla Lee spent 9 years and $80,000 trying to have a child. She has 
gone through several miscarriages, and she was days away--days away--
from getting a viable embryo transferred. But instead of getting that 
embryo transplanted, she got the same heartbreaking phone call. Her 
hopes of a family were being put on hold. Years of trying, tens of 
thousands of dollars, and, at the last moment, Republicans pulled the 
rug out from under her.
  Even families who already have gone through IVF are facing the 
fallout. Can they afford to pay and store unused embryos indefinitely? 
Can they be prosecuted if they don't? They don't know. Right now, no 
one knows.
  The anger, the anguish, the stories of these women are heartbreaking.
  As IVF patient Kelly Belmont put it, ``We've already invested so much 
time and money and just physical and emotional anguish into this 
process, and to think that it could have all been for nothing and that 
we could be ending our journey to be able to have children--it's 
absolutely terrifying. I am just trying to hold myself together 
emotionally.''
  So powerful. I don't know how anyone can listen to these stories and 
still think politicians should be making women's healthcare decisions 
for them. I really don't.
  Now, I said earlier that Republicans are acting surprised now by the 
result of the very policies they have pushed for. They can save their 
breath. That is because actions speak louder than words, and many of 
the same Republicans saying they care now about IVF are literally right 
now cosponsors of legislation that would enshrine fetal personhood into 
law and make IVF unavailable nationwide.

[[Page S1035]]

  You cannot support IVF and support fetal personhood laws. They are 
fundamentally incompatible.
  Instead of empty words, Democrats want to see action, and that is why 
we just tried to pass the Access to Family Building Act. It doesn't get 
any more straightforward than that, and yet, just now, Republicans 
blocked the bill and showed their true colors when it comes to IVF.
  I am frustrated, but I am not done fighting because I know Americans 
are watching, and they will not forget who is standing with families in 
Alabama and across the country and who is standing in their way.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, as part of what we are doing here 
today, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be permitted 
to speak for up to 5 minutes each prior to the scheduled votes: myself, 
Senator Kaine, Senator Warren, and Senator Wyden.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I have been really awed and humbled 
by the eloquence of the women Senators who have preceded me, and I 
hesitate to add to what they have stated so powerfully already. But, of 
course, I am a man, and this bill is about women's reproductive care 
and women's rights, but it is also about the rights of all of us. The 
name of the act is the Access to Family Building Act. It is about 
families. It is about men, like myself, whose most awesome moment in 
life was the time they held their newly born child.
  Men have an equal stake in the issue that brings us here today. Men 
should be as scared and angry as women are about this trend, which is 
so destructive to basic rights and liberties. Women's rights are human 
rights. The rights at stake here are rights that are American. What 
could be more American than wanting to bring a child into the world?
  And what could be more heartbreaking? We have all been through it, 
through friends, neighbors, maybe our own family. A man and woman in 
love, wanting to have a child, miscarriages, other obstacles that 
prevent it, and there is a hole in their hearts, a hole in their homes 
and their families, as they struggle with issues of fertility and 
childbirth. This measure very simply guarantees the right for women and 
families everywhere--in Alabama, in Connecticut, in every State in this 
country--to access the fertility care they need to bring children into 
the world.

  You know, over 3 years ago, before Dobbs was decided--and we never 
could have imagined that Roe v. Wade would be overturned--and the 
Republican Party eviscerated access to abortion care, I posed what I 
thought was a really easy question to a Supreme Court nominee, Amy 
Coney Barrett. I asked: Is it constitutional to criminalize IVF 
treatment? She dodged. She dodged. She refused to answer. I thought it 
was self-evident. It is not constitutional to criminalize IVF 
treatment. That was before Dobbs. That was before the legal landscape 
was volcanically uprooted by this Supreme Court, which has been 
captured by a far-right fringe.
  Some may have wondered why at that time I asked what seemed like a 
very far-fetched, obtuse, arcane question. A lot of people probably 
didn't even know what it meant, and they may have also wondered why 
Justice Barrett refused to answer such an obvious question with such a 
self-evident answer. Wasn't it settled that IVF treatment is not only 
legally protected but also a scientific miracle? Think of it for a 
moment, the science here that is now accessible to every American, 
everyone in the world. Wasn't IVF pro-family, having children, parents 
who wanted a child? And they may have wondered as well, wasn't IVF the 
last, best hope for so many people struggling with infertility, 
desperately seeking to experience the miracle of childbirth for 
themselves? Who could possibly object to that miracle in the lives of a 
family who would not only relish but raise a child to contribute to our 
great country?
  What has become devastatingly and tragically clear is that the 
Republican Party's animosity toward women's health and women's rights 
doesn't stop at abortion. It is why I asked that IVF question in 2020, 
and it is why I didn't get a clear answer from a Republican nominee for 
the Supreme Court. The war on women and on reproductive choices by 
women and the war on families hasn't stopped at abortion or even IVF.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). Senator, your time is up.
  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. So I conclude by thanking my colleagues who have 
brought this measure to the floor, particularly Senator Duckworth, and 
I regret that Republicans have blocked this measure.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, the first child born in vitro in the 
United States was Elizabeth Carr, and she was born in Norfolk, VA, in 
1981. Elizabeth's parents were Massachusetts residents. They struggled 
with infertility, and their dream was to have a child. Yet it was not 
to be--until they heard about a husband-and-wife team, Howard and 
Georgeanna Jones, who had been reproductive physicians at Johns Hopkins 
and then went to England to train with the early pioneer of in vitro 
fertilization, and they came back to the United States wanting to open 
a clinic to help couples deal with fertility issues. It must have been 
a hard road for them to find a place that said yes because this seemed 
like science fiction at the time, but the Eastern Virginia Medical 
School in Norfolk said: Open a fertility clinic here.
  I was 23 years old then, and in my memory, there was something about 
it on the cover of Newsweek. I have gone back and realized, no, it was 
Life magazine. Because it seemed like science fiction. The science is 
so hard to even wrap your head around, and yet the Carrs read about 
this, and they started to travel--they were not people with much 
money--they started to travel to Norfolk and became patients of the two 
doctors, and their daughter Elizabeth was born in Virginia in 1981. She 
is 42 years old today. She is raising her own family today.
  Elizabeth has been followed--wrap your head around this: What seemed 
like unimaginable science fiction in 1981, there are now, by best 
estimates, 12 million people walking this planet who were born by IVF, 
living their lives, being happy, raising families, contributing to 
their communities--12 million people. What could be more pro-life than 
in vitro fertilization? Twelve million people.
  Elizabeth was interviewed 2 days ago by WBUR, a public radio and 
television station in Boston. Here is what she said. She talked about 
her life and what she is doing, and then she said this, very 
chillingly: ``For the first time in my life, I feel like an endangered 
species.''
  ``I feel like an endangered species.''
  I think many of us believed that the Dobbs decision--and we made 
predictions about it--was not fundamentally about pro-life; it was 
about control. It was about control of women's decisions with respect 
to abortion, with respect to contraception, and now with respect to 
deciding: If there is a path out of infertility, I can have a child. 
They want to control that too. That is what the Alabama Supreme Court 
has done, and that is what Dobbs was about, and that is why I am proud 
to sign on to the bill led by Senator Duckworth, the Access to Family 
Building Act. It is as simple a bill as can be. Healthcare providers 
have a right to provide fertility treatment, including in vitro 
services. Patients have a right to access fertility treatment, 
including in vitro fertilization services.
  This is not a mandate. The enforcement provisions are provisions that 
allow a person or a healthcare provider to bring action against the 
State or governmental entity that tries to interfere with the right 
that they have. No State should interfere with this right--none.
  This is a very simple bill that would enable the Elizabeth Carrs of 
the world to continue to be born and to continue to live happy and 
productive lives. I am so glad to be a cosponsor.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, just now, my friend and colleague 
Senator Tammy Duckworth, a longtime champion for IVF and a longtime 
champion for families, put forward an important bill that would ensure 
that families

[[Page S1036]]

have access to the services they need to have a baby, including IVF.
  Since then, Republicans have blocked this bill to protect IVF. Now, 
remember that for all their talk about supporting IVF, when it came 
down to it right here in this Chamber, Republicans blocked IVF 
protection.
  Republican opposition to IVF is terrifying. It makes me furious. But 
it should not surprise anyone. Donald Trump set the stage for the 
attacks on reproductive rights when he stacked the Supreme Court with 
ultraconservative Justices and overturned Roe v. Wade. Since then, 
Republicans have banned or severely restricted abortion in 24 States. 
They are trying to ban medication abortion nationwide. Now in Alabama, 
these extremists have virtually outlawed IVF, fertility care that gives 
people a chance to start a family.
  This has always been about conservative politicians controlling 
women's bodies. This has been Donald Trump and the Republicans' plan 
all along. And the opposition to Senator Duckworth's proposal today 
shows that Republicans are doubling down against reproductive freedom. 
They are coming for medication abortion, they are coming for birth 
control, and they are even coming for prenatal care. Make no mistake--
we will fight them every step of the way.
  I want to talk for just a minute about the people who are affected by 
these extremist policies: families in Alabama who have been wanting and 
praying that IVF can help them have a baby; women who have injected 
themselves with medication for weeks or months or even years; people 
who have spent their entire life savings trying to start a family, only 
now to see their hopes go down the drain; LGBTQ families who have spent 
years taking on every obstacle just for the chance to have a baby of 
their own, and for some, this was the last chance.
  Now Republicans like Donald Trump and those in this Chamber might try 
to backtrack, might try to say that they are working to protect IVF, 
but it is all talk. Senate Republicans' actions today speak louder than 
any empty promises they make. Americans can tell when Republican 
politicians try to talk out of both sides of their mouths.
  The American people want reproductive freedom. The American people 
support parents and those desperately trying to become parents.
  So here is what comes next. Democrats have made clear that we stand 
with President Biden, with Vice President Harris, and with the millions 
of families affected by these heartless policies. We stand to protect 
reproductive rights for people all across this country. Together, we 
will fight for every person to have access to a safe abortion. We will 
fight for every family to have access to the services needed to have a 
baby. And we won't stop fighting until we secure the Congress that we 
need to protect reproductive freedom for everyone in this country.
  I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Duckworth's bill, and 
together we are going to get this done.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I want to say to my colleague from 
Illinois that I am so proud to be a supporter of your legislation that 
is going to provide the necessary protections for women in America to 
become mothers.
  I think I mentioned this to my colleague at lunch a couple of days 
ago. Thirty years ago, Madame President, I wrote the Fertility Clinic 
Success Rate and Certification Act into law, and I would just say to my 
colleague, back then, we never thought--never thought--we would have to 
be standing today on the floor of the United States Senate debating 
this, as we are today. But we are here because a few days ago, 
Alabama's far-right Supreme Court handed down a first-of-its-kind 
ruling effectively making IVF impossible in Alabama.
  We are seeing heartbreaking headlines about couples in that State 
being forced to rethink their plans to start a family through the IVF 
process that was just in effect 30 years ago. Some of these families 
have already spent tens of thousands of dollars and have undergone 
extensive medical treatment. Alabama's largest hospital system, the 
University of Alabama, has already paused its IVF services out of fear 
of prosecution.
  The decision to conceive a child through IVF is rarely ever a 
parent's first choice. It is physically and emotionally painful, taxing 
and tedious, and it is expensive. But for countless couples dreaming of 
just one thing--just one thing--the chance to start a family, the 
legislation that my colleagues have been working on is absolutely 
essential.
  The IVF journey, as we started talking about years ago, for so many 
parents is grueling, filled with countless doctor's appointments, 
agonizing waits for test results, and too often--too often--
disappointment. The process is very delicate. Embryos can expire at any 
time during the process entirely by accident.
  Under Alabama's new ruling, a doctor or a woman undergoing treatment 
could be charged with wrongful death if an embryo expires during the 
IVF transfer or implementation process. That means women who are 
already undergoing this incredibly painful process could also be handed 
a wrongful death lawsuit on top of everything else. That, in my view, 
Madame President and colleagues, is nothing short of criminalizing 
people who try to become parents.
  Unfortunately, while this ruling is a shocking one, it is not all 
that surprising if you have been paying attention to the ongoing war 
that the far right is waging on women and families in America. For 
years, Republicans laughed off the concerns about the vulnerability of 
abortion protections under Roe. Then they gutted it at the first 
opportunity.
  Since the Dobbs decision, these same Republicans have tried again to 
convince the American people that there is no threat of a national 
abortion law and no threat to any other facet of reproductive freedom, 
like contraception--in short, no domino effect. Instead, the repeal of 
Roe has laid the groundwork for an onslaught of court rulings just like 
this one in Alabama, which explicitly references the Dobbs case. The 
gaslighting would be laughable if it weren't so terrifying. We have all 
become familiar with the adage: When someone shows you who they are, 
believe them the first time.
  At every opportunity, Republicans have moved mountains in order to 
restrict the constitutional rights and freedoms of women, making it 
impossible for them to live their lives free from government intrusion. 
It is pretty clear to me they are not going to rest until there is a 
politician in every bedroom and exam room in America.
  In the wake of last week's ruling, I saw a lot of my Republican 
colleagues attempt to distance themselves from the decision, claiming 
that they unequivocally support IVF, but that is what they put in 
motion when they overturned Roe v. Wade. In fact, a year ago, Senate 
Democrats tried to pass Senator Duckworth's bill. Senate Republicans 
blocked it. So now it is clear. If colleagues really do support IVF, as 
so many were spending the whole weekend claiming, then they are in 
luck. They are in luck because Senator Duckworth is going to give them 
an opportunity to prove it by going on the record this evening and 
supporting this legislation.
  As I say to my friend from Illinois, I was thinking of you when 
coming over here today because back 30 years ago, nobody ever thought 
we would have to be out here just trying to get started in making sure 
families had information. But what you are doing is so incredibly 
important, Senator Duckworth, because with your legislation, in 
America, we will have the necessary protections for women to become 
mothers using IVF.
  I urge my colleagues to strongly support the Duckworth legislation.

                      Nomination of Melissa Damian

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Melissa Damian to the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida.
  Judge Damian's deep ties to the Southern District of Florida and her 
experience in the courtroom, as a litigator and on the bench, have 
prepared her to serve as a U.S. District Judge.
  A graduate of Princeton University and the University of Miami School 
of Law, Judge Damian clerked for the Hon. Ursula Ungaro on the Southern 
District before working in private practice. From 1999 to 2010, Judge 
Damian

[[Page S1037]]

was an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District, serving in the criminal division, civil division, 
and appellate division. In 2010, Judge Damian returned to private 
practice, representing plaintiffs in asbestos and tobacco product 
liability cases and later focusing on litigating complex business and 
commercial matters in State and Federal court, at both the trial and 
appellate levels. Over the course of her legal career, Judge Damian 
tried more than 30 cases to verdict. Since 2022, Judge Damian has 
served as a U.S. magistrate judge on the Southern District. She has 
presided over two trials that went to verdict or final judgment and has 
issued approximately 170 written opinions and substantive orders.
  Judge Damian has the strong support from her home State Senators, Mr. 
Rubio and Mr. Scott. In addition, she was unanimously rated ``well 
qualified'' by the American Bar Association.
  I urge my colleagues to support Judge Damian's nomination.

                      Tribute to Martina McLennan

  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, Ann Bancroft, the first woman to reach 
both the North and South Poles, said:

       It looks like I do these journeys alone, but it takes great 
     support from people in the wings pushing you along these 
     journeys and helping you.

  The same can be said of us here in the U.S. Senate. It might look 
like Senators here in this Chamber lead and legislate alone; but, in 
fact, we are only able to do our work with support of the people in the 
wings--our dedicated and our tireless staff.
  Tonight, I am here to bid farewell to one of the Senate's most 
dedicated staffers and one of the longest serving members of Team 
Merkley, my communications director Martina McLennan.
  Martina, like Ann Bancroft, is a daughter of Minnesota. Martina, like 
Ann Bancroft, then connected with Oregon--Ann by attending the 
University of Oregon, and Martina, by serving the people of Oregon for 
the last 13 years.
  She joined our communications team in 2011. Back then, President 
Obama and I were still in our first terms. Social media was still 
pretty new. Our world and our media landscape have, in fact, changed a 
lot since then.
  Along the way, Martina has done every possible role in 
communications: writing speeches, drafting press releases, creating 
social media content,

[[Page S1038]]

crafting op-eds, jotting talking points, compiling newsletters, 
pitching reporters on both coasts, and reading and translating my 
handwriting, which may have been the most difficult task of all because 
I can't read it 5 minutes after the ink dries--all the while 
thoughtfully advising and gently guiding me.
  She has been by my side through some of the biggest and most 
challenging moments of the time that I have been here in the Senate: 
helping secure more funding for the U.S. Forest Service to fight 
wildfires in 2012; supporting Janet Yellen, the first woman to chair 
the Federal Reserve; ensuring that regulators actually implemented our 
stronger Volcker rule in 2013; mourning with the citizens of Roseburg, 
OR, after the Umpqua Community College shooting in 2015; ensuring that 
we led the resistance at rallies and protests following President 
Trump's election in 2016; preparing and staffing me through the night 
during my 15-hour-and-27-minute marathon speech against Neil Gorsuch's 
Supreme Court nomination in 2017; traveling to the southern border with 
me in 2018 to show the world how the Trump administration was ripping 
immigrant children out of their parents' arms; writing, editing, and 
annotating our office's comprehensive 80-page report on the Trump 
administration's attacks on immigration and asylum in 2019; reorienting 
our entire communications operation to a virtual operation when the 
pandemic hit; supporting Oregon communities after the Labor Day 
wildfires in 2020; cleaning up my hideaway after it was ransacked by 
insurrectionists on January 6, 2021; and, through it all, finally, for 
filling in for long stretches when we were down a digital director or 
speechwriter or a deputy press secretary.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On page S1038, February 28, 2024, first column, the following 
appears: preparing and staffing me through the night during my 15-
hour-and-27-minute marathon speech against Brett Kavanaugh's 
Supreme Court nomination in 2017;
  
  The online Record has been corrected to read: preparing and 
staffing me through the night during my 15-hour-and-27-minute 
marathon speech against Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination in 
2017;


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  As one of our team members put it, ``She's unstoppable.''
  And my staff talk about how Martina, in addition to her communication 
talents, is always the first to welcome and support a new member of our 
team, whether that member is in Washington, DC, or in Oregon.
  In 2017, the first year of the Trump administration, the turnout of 
our townhalls was extraordinary, including one townhall where more than 
3,000 people showed up. So Martina flew out from DC to support our new 
Oregon team with her years of experience, wisdom, and lightning-quick 
wit.
  And every year, when Senate staff dress up their dogs in Halloween 
costumes for Senator Tillis's annual ``Bipawtisan'' puppy parade 
through the atrium of the Hart Office Building, Martina goes down to 
take the pictures and share the joy with our team on both coasts.
  As one of our former Oregon team members put it:

       I looked forward to each Halloween because Martina would 
     send [those] pictures, keeping stateside staff informed about 
     the best day of the year in [Washington], DC.

  I am not sure what it says about our work here when the best day is 
when there is a puppy parade.
  She is also a brilliant writer. One of our team conservatively 
estimates that she has written millions of words for our office, 
putting dry policy language into punchy, plain English with stunning 
speed and navigating thorny political issues with eloquence and grace.
  One of her longtime colleagues said:

       I always liken her to a piano virtuoso taking their seat in 
     a concert hall and banging out Mozart or Rachmaninoff and 
     making it look effortless while I struggled just to keep up.

  Her colleagues will line up to tell you that, working every day in 
the chaos of the Senate, Martina is ``refreshingly calm,'' 
``thoughtful,'' ``kind,'' and an ``encyclopedic fountain of 
knowledge,'' who is ``rarely seen without a smile or funny remark, even 
in the most stressful of times.''
  When she speaks in a meeting, people listen. I listen. She was one of 
the very first in our office to speak about the need for what has 
become our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Steering Committee.
  Generations of our staff have stories about her quiet gestures of 
kindness and support that have meant so much to so many over so many 
years. That is especially true of her communications team, past and 
present, some of whom have been able to join us tonight.
  Even in the toughest moments, she is always there to laugh and 
commiserate while still delivering the most professional and effective 
communications operation in the Senate. Whether it has been struggling 
through late-night shutdown shenanigans while she and another colleague 
were battling the flu, to encouraging new staff members to offer 
creative ideas even if the office had never tried anything like that 
action before, she has always been there for her team.
  As one said:

       I'm still in major denial. I have never felt like I was 
     more a part of a team than here, and a huge part of that is 
     Martina.

  Another said:

       It's hard for me to put into words the difference Martina 
     has made in my life as she has continued to mentor and guide 
     me--always a text message or email away with invaluable 
     insights.

  Yet another colleague summed it up by saying:

       I . . . feel constantly lucky to have worked with, for, and 
     alongside Martina. I always admired and respected the way she 
     approached her work--with humility, grace, and humor--and 
     more than a little bit of sarcasm.
       And I consider myself extraordinarily fortunate to have not 
     only been able to call her a colleague but to be able to 
     continue to call her a very dear friend.

  I couldn't have said that better myself.
  Next week, for the first time in 13 years, I will attend the State of 
the Union Address without Martina by my side. For more than a decade, 
we have elbowed our way through the television cameras in crowded 
Statuary Hall, rushing from interview to interview late into the night. 
I am going to miss her next week.
  Then there are those thousands of floor charts and hundreds of 
interviews that have occurred over more than two terms in the Senate.
  Tonight, Martina is here, staffing me on the Senate floor for the 
last time.
  At the beginning of my remarks, I quoted Ann Bancroft, who went on to 
say the following:

       Stay curious, keep learning, and keep experiencing. Life is 
     wild and wonderful, and it's good to challenge yourself now 
     and then.

  Ann went on to say:

       I always say that my best advice is to ``get lost''--
     because . . . that's when the good life stories are created, 
     and you will always find your way back.

  Well, soon, Martina will be following Ann Bancroft's advice as she 
sets off for Southern California and the start of the Pacific Crest 
Trail, which she will follow north, all the way to Canada, with Ann 
Bancroft's words in her ears, saying:

       It's good to challenge yourself now and then.

  And her best advice is to ``get lost'' as ``that's when good life 
stories are created, and you will . . . find your way back.''
  Well, I look forward to her stopping on the Pacific Crest Trail in 
Oregon and saying hello.
  For now, though, I will simply say it is with deep gratitude that 
Team Merkley and I thank Martina McLennan for her many years of service 
to the U.S. Senate and to the people of Oregon. We toast her tonight 
with an appropriate saying: ``Happy trails.''
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                        TRIBUTE TO TOM SKILLING

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there are many things that Chicagoans 
disagree on: deep-dish or tavern style, Cubs or Sox, giardiniera or 
sweet peppers. But one thing that Chicagoans have in common? They get 
their weather from Tom Skilling. For 45 years, Tom has been the 
authoritative source on all things weather in Chicago. And after nearly 
five decades of forecasting snow, sleet, sun, and storms, today was his 
last day on air.
  A native of Aurora, Tom began his career at the almost unbelievable 
age of 14. He held a series of radio and television jobs throughout 
Illinois and then studied meteorology and journalism at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison. In August 1978, Tom joined WGN, and it is not 
hyperbole to say Chicago's weather forecasts have never been the same 
since.
  As a meteorologist, Tom gave weather forecasts to his viewers. But he 
was

[[Page S1040]]

so much more than just a ``weatherman.'' Tom was a storm chaser--having 
famously chased and been chased by a tornado. He was an awestruck 
weather observer--being overcome by emotion while watching a total 
solar eclipse in Carbondale in August 2017. He was a comedian--bringing 
viewers belly laughs with his viral ``Tom Freakin' Skilling'' skit. And 
perhaps most importantly, he was an educator--explaining to viewers the 
``why'' behind the weather.
  In fact, Tom's focus on the science of climate change and weather 
patterns only grew as his career did. In addition to broadcasting his 
weather forecasts on WGN News, Tom also hosted nearly 40 years of 
severe weather seminars at Fermilab and penned a Chicago Tribune column 
answering weather-related questions. In both, Tom used his platform to 
educate his audience in a down to earth and understandable manner.
  Tom's legendary career has earned him a reputation for setting the 
gold standard in television weather, garnered him a cult-like 
following, and afforded him a permanent place in Chicagoans' living 
rooms. Unsurprisingly, he has been showered with countless accolades 
for his work, winning multiple Emmy Awards from the Chicago/Midwest 
chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and 
receiving several honorary degrees. He deserves each and every one.
  I had the privilege of sharing the stage with Tom in the summer of 
2019 at a forum to discuss climate change with U.S. Representatives 
Bill Foster and Sean Casten. I can tell you, not a single Member of 
Congress on that stage was under the illusion that they were the main 
attraction. People were there for Tom.
  Tom, congratulations on a truly remarkable career. From choosing how 
many layers to wear in the morning to knowing when the break in the 
snow is coming so we can shovel our parking spots, I don't quite know 
how we will weather the storm of life without your valuable insights. 
You are nothing short of a Chicago institution. And it is only fitting 
that you will live on in the weather world, in the form of a Chicago 
snowplow named ``Skilling It'' in your honor. Short of having you on 
air to warn us of snow, having a Tom Skilling snowplow keeping the 
streets safe is a close second.
  But, luckily, even in your absence, we will not have to predict the 
weather for ourselves. Congratulations to your successor, Demetrius 
Ivory, on being named as WGN's new chief meteorologist. Though 
Demetrius certainly has large shoes to fill, there are no better 
footsteps to follow in than yours. I wish him luck in his new role.
  Tom, thank you for all the warmth you brought into our homes during 
even the coldest of Chicago winters. Wishing you sunny days during this 
next, well-deserved chapter of your life.

                          ____________________

                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

Germany--High-Frequency, Very-High Frequency, and Ultra-High Frequency 
                                 Radios

       The Government of Germany has requested to buy AN/PRC-117 
     radios; AN/PRC-160 radios; spare and repair parts; support 
     equipment; tools and test equipment; diagnostic equipment; 
     technical data and publications; personnel training and 
     training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor technical 
     assistance; technical and logistics support services; and 
     other related elements of logistics and program support. The 
     estimated total cost is $281 million.
       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and 
     national security of the United States by improving the 
     security of a NATO Ally that is an important force for 
     political and economic stability in Europe.
       The proposed sale will improve interoperability between 
     Germany and other NATO military forces and will increase 
     secure communications effectiveness to help combat current 
     and future threats. Germany will have no difficulty absorbing 
     this equipment into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be L3Harris Global 
     Communications, Inc., Rochester, NY. There are no known 
     offset agreements in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives 
     to Germany.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 24-22

  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 
                36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AN/PRC-117 and AN/PRC-160 radios and their 
     accessories are used to transmit and receive voice and data 
     information using Type-1 encryption.
       2. The highest level of classification of defense articles, 
     components, and services included in this potential sale is 
     SECRET.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures or 
     equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or 
     be used in the development of a system with similar or 
     advanced capabilities.
       4. A determination has been made that Germany can provide 
     substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive 
     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale 
     is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
     national security objectives outlined in the Policy 
     Justification.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     Germany.

                        SFRC Meeting Memorandum

     To: Chairman Cardin.
     From: Charlotte Oldham-Moore, Molly Barlow, Stephanie Oviedo.
     Date: Tuesday, February 27, 2024.
     Re: Meeting with ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric Egger.
       Meeting Purpose: On Thursday, February 29 at 11:30AM in SH-
     509, YOU will have a meeting with Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, 
     President of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
     (ICRC), Charlotte will staff. Ms. Spoljaric would like to 
     discuss the ICRC's operations in Israel/Gaza, Ukraine, and

[[Page S1041]]

     Sudan as well as the prospects for passage of U.S. 
     supplemental funding.


                             BLC Objectives

       Express your commitment to upholding international 
     humanitarian law and addressing global humanitarian crises, 
     including by passing the supplemental funding.
       [Israel/Gaza point to be provided by Team MENA]


                   BLC Message & Suggested Questions

       Israel and Gaza:
       [questions and talking points to follow from Team MENA]
       Kidnapped Ukrainian Children: I know that the ICRC has a 
     unique perspective as one of the few interlocutors that talks 
     to both sides and with the ability to operate in occupied 
     territories in Ukraine as well as within the Russian 
     Federation.
       How do you engage with the Russian government on questions 
     of kidnapped children? Have you found more success engaging 
     with certain Russian agencies than others?
       How does the ICC arrest warrant for Putin and his 
     Commissioner for Children's Rights influence the Russian 
     response to engagement on kidnapped children? Is there 
     additional leverage that the international community could 
     bring to bear to help you succeed in your mission of 
     reuniting families?
       War Crimes and Atrocities in Ukraine:
       Can you discuss the nature of war crimes and atrocities 
     being committed in occupied territories now? Is there 
     additional engagement or resources from the international 
     community necessary to help support victims and prevent 
     future such atrocities and war crimes?
       Sudan: There has been bipartisan and bicameral support for 
     increasing U.S. leadership to resolve the horrific crisis in 
     Sudan. I was pleased to see the Administration name a Special 
     Envoy for Sudan, which I expect to put us in a much better 
     position to exert diplomatic pressure to bring about a 
     ceasefire. In addition to increasing our diplomatic efforts, 
     we need greater resources to address the humanitarian 
     catastrophe.
       Where can the U.S. do more to support the work of the ICRC 
     and other humanitarian organizations in Sudan?
       What is your impression of the effectiveness of U.S. 
     mediation efforts?
       Armenia: USAID has committed more than $4 million in 
     additional humanitarian assistance to people displaced by 
     Azerbaijan's military operation in Nagorno Karabkah. But with 
     over 74,000 refugees, I know that the needs are great.
       Has the international response been sufficient to support 
     the vulnerable population from Karabakh forced to leave their 
     entire lives behind?
       Humanitarian Funding: As you know, the Senate's bill for 
     supplemental funding, which includes more than $9 billion for 
     humanitarian assistance, is still under consideration in the 
     House. This funding is critical to addressing the massive 
     shortfall between available assistance and growing needs.
       Given the growing humanitarian needs, how can Congress more 
     effectively assist the ICRC and push other countries--
     including partners that have traditionally not provided 
     substantial foreign assistance--to step up to the plate?


                               Background

       Gaza: In response to the, October 7 attacks, the ICRC 
     scaled up its humanitarian response in Israel and Gaza. As 
     part of this effort, the ICRC has actively advocated for the 
     release of all hostages immediately and unconditionally. 
     Concurrently, the ICRC has asked to visit the hostages, to 
     check on their conditions, to deliver medical care, and to 
     facilitate communication with their families. When political 
     agreements allowed hostages to be released, the ICRC played 
     the role of neutral intermediary to facilitate the release, 
     transfer, and return of 109 hostages from Gaza to their 
     families. ICRC also facilitated the release, transfer and 
     return of 154 Palestinian detainees from Israeli places of 
     detention to their families. The ICRC works closely with its 
     partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent 
     Movement and continues to work closely with local service-
     providers, communities and other partners on the ground.
       Ukraine: With over 800 staff working in eight locations, 
     Ukraine is the ICRC's largest operation in 2024. Working 
     alongside partners from the International Red Cross and Red 
     Crescent Movement, the ICRC has provided humanitarian 
     assistance to over 11.6 million people since February 2022. 
     ICRC staff have visited almost 2,400 prisoners of war on both 
     sides, sharing news and updates directly with thousands of 
     families. The ICRC continues to push for access to all 
     prisoners of war through bilateral dialogue and to advocate 
     for the reunification of kidnapped Ukrainian children with 
     their families.
       Sudan: The ICRC's work in Sudan, in cooperation with the 
     Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS), includes promoting 
     respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL), supporting 
     hospitals and health facilities with equipment and supplies, 
     working with local water authorities on improving people's 
     access to clean water and supporting the authorities in 
     providing rehabilitation services for people with 
     disabilities. The ICRC is helping families separated by 
     conflict or displacement to keep in touch with their loved 
     ones, and has facilitated the release of detainees upon 
     request of the parties. Since the beginning of the conflict 
     between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support 
     Forces (RSF) in April 2023, the ICRC has acted as a neutral 
     intermediary between parties to the conflict and conducted 
     various activities to protect and assist those affected by 
     the consequences of the crisis.
       ICRC Funding: The ICRC is appealing for $2.34 billion in 
     2024, a 13% cut from the previous year's appeal. One quarter 
     of the ICRC's total funding comes from the United States. The 
     Senate-passed supplemental included $3.5 billion in the 
     Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, which 
     includes funding for the ICRC.
       Biography: Ms. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger has been ICRC 
     President since October 2022. From 2018 to 2022, she served 
     as the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant 
     Administrator of the UN Development Program (UNDP), and 
     Director of the Regional Bureau for Europe and the CIS. Prior 
     to joining the UN, Ms. Spoljaric had many years of 
     distinguished service with the Swiss Diplomatic Corps, where 
     she served as Ambassador and Head of the United Nations and 
     International Organizations Division, and as Counsellor and 
     Head of the Political Team at the Permanent Mission of 
     Switzerland to the UN. From 2010-2012, Ms. Spoljaric was 
     seconded to the Office of the Commissioner-General of the UN 
     Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
     East (UNRWA) as Senior Advisor covering organizational 
     development, management reforms, and external relations. Ms. 
     Spoljaric studied Philosophy, Economics and International Law 
     at the Universities of Basel and Geneva and holds a master's 
     degree.

                         REMEMBERING PATSY MINK

  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, next month, the U.S. Mint will launch a 
quarter featuring the late-Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink as part of 
its American Women Quarters Program, which celebrates women who have 
made significant contributions to our country.
  Congresswoman Mink, who represented Hawaii from 1965 to 1977 and 1990 
to 2002, was a tireless advocate for gender and racial equality, and I 
am proud to have sent the letter recommending her inclusion in this 
program. Mrs. Mink's quarter will soon be in circulation alongside 
Edith Kanakaole's, another noteworthy woman from Hawaii who was honored 
by the American Women Quarters Program last year.
  Mrs. Mink can be defined by her incredible resiliency and drive in 
the face of injustice. Born on December 6, 1927, in Paia, Maui, she 
attended Maui High School and received a bachelor's degree from the 
University of Hawaii at Manoa. After being denied admission to medical 
school because of her gender, Mrs. Mink chose to pursue a law degree 
and devoted her life to fighting for civil rights.
  Over the following decades, her life was marked by an impressive 
series of firsts: She was the first Japanese American woman to practice 
law in Hawaii; the first woman elected to Hawaii's territorial 
legislature; and the first woman of color and first Asian American 
woman to serve in Congress.
  At each stage in her career, Mrs. Mink fought against prejudice and 
advocated for greater opportunities for women. While in Congress, she 
coauthored the Title IX amendment of the Higher Education Act of 1972 
(Title IX). This landmark law, comprised of only 37 words, ensured that 
no person would be denied access to any federally funded education 
program on the basis of sex. Title IX, coupled with Mrs. Mink's Women's 
Educational Equity Act of 1974, gave women and girls unprecedented 
access to educational and athletic opportunities.

  On page S1041, February 28, 2024, in the third column, the 
following appears: At each stage of her career, Mrs. Mink fought 
against prejudice and advocated for greater opportunities for 
woman.
  
  The online Record has been corrected to read: At each stage of 
her career, Mrs. Mink fought against prejudice and advocated for 
greater opportunities for women.


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  Mrs. Mink also advocated for early childhood education, pushed for 
greater government transparency, and cocreated the Congressional Asian 
Pacific American Caucus--CAPAC--to promote the well-being of the Asian 
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community.
  After Mrs. Mink's passing on September 28, 2002, Mrs. Mink was 
inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, our Nation's highest civilian award. 
Today, Mrs. Mink's legacy continues on through the Patsy Takemoto Mink 
Foundation, led by Mrs. Mink's daughter Dr. Gwendolyn Mink, which 
supports educational access for low-income women and children. In 2022, 
50 years after the passage of Title IX, we also honored Mrs. Mink's 
work by hanging her portrait in the U.S. Capitol, where it is now 
displayed directly across from the portrait of Shirley Chisholm, 
another trailblazer in her own right.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  Congress has also renamed the Title IX amendment of the Higher 
Education

[[Page S1042]]

Act as the ``Pasty T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.'' This 
is a fitting tribute to Mrs. Mink, whose work continues to benefit 
women, girls, and LGBTQ students today. I, like many other women, stand 
on the shoulders of Mrs. Mink, and I am lucky to have considered her a 
dear friend.
  Thank you, Congresswoman Mink, for all your contributions to our 
State and this Nation.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby 
report that I have issued an Executive Order that expands the scope of 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 
2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and 
Services Supply Chain), and further addressed with additional measures 
in Executive Order 14034 of June 9, 2021 (Protecting Americans' 
Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries).
  The continuing effort of certain countries of concern to access 
Americans' sensitive personal data and United States Government-related 
data constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its 
source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. Access to 
Americans' bulk sensitive personal data or United States Government-
related data increases the ability of countries of concern to engage in 
a wide range of malicious activities, including espionage, influence, 
kinetic, or cyber operations, or to identify other potential strategic 
advantages over the United States.
  To address this threat and to take further steps with respect to the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873, the order 
authorizes the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of 
Homeland Security and in consultation with the heads of relevant 
agencies, to issue, subject to public notice and comment, regulations 
to prohibit or otherwise restrict the large-scale transfer of 
Americans' personal data to countries of concern and to provide 
safeguards around other activities that can give those countries access 
to sensitive data. Section 2(b) of the order authorizes the Attorney 
General, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, to take 
such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and 
to employ all other powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the order.
  In addition, section 2(d) of the order authorizes the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, acting through the Director of the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, in coordination with the Attorney 
General and in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, to 
propose, seek public comment on, and publish security requirements that 
address the unacceptable risk posed by restricted transactions, as 
identified by the Attorney General. Section 2(e) of the order 
authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the 
Attorney General, to take such actions, including promulgating rules, 
regulations, standards, and requirements; issuing interpretive 
guidance; and employing all other powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes described in 
section 2(d) of the order.
  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
The White House, February 28, 2024.

                       TRIBUTE TO ADDISON HATLEY

      By Mr. PADILLA:
  S. 3830. A bill to authorize the Low-Income Household Water 
Assistance Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I rise to introduce the Low-Income 
Household Water Assistance Program Establishment Act or LIHWAP 
Establishment Act. This legislation would establish the first-ever 
permanent, national water assistance program to help low-income 
households pay their water bills.
  In 2021, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress provided 
$1.1 billion of critical assistance through the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2021 and American Rescue Plan of 2021 to low-
income households struggling to pay water and sewer bills. Since then,

[[Page S1046]]

LIHWAP has helped 1.4 million households across the country maintain or 
restore access to water service. However, LIHWAP was created as an 
emergency program and expired at the end of fiscal year 2023.
  Recognizing the importance of Federal water assistance, Congress 
passed the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act, which directed the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to create a Rural and Low-Income 
Water Assistance Pilot Program and report to Congress on the results of 
the pilot.
  The LIHWAP Establishment Act would provide the necessary 
congressional authorization for a permanent LIHWAP beyond the COVID-19 
emergency.
  The LIHWAP Establishment Act would direct the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, to 
establish a permanent low-income water assistance program. Just as the 
program did during the pandemic, LIHWAP would award grants to States, 
territories, and Tribes to assist low-income households in paying for 
drinking water or wastewater services.
  The bill would also empower nonprofit organizations to assist small, 
rural, underserved, and Tribal water systems apply for and access 
LIHWAP funding, as well as direct HHS to provide technical assistance 
to help agencies and water systems set up data sharing agreements to 
streamline eligibility requirements for low-income households.
  In addition, the bill would transfer authority for the program from 
HHS to the EPA upon completion of the EPA's Rural and Low-Income Water 
Assistance Pilot Program.
  Safeguarding water affordability for all Americans remains critical 
as household water and sewer bills rise faster than electric bills and 
inflation. Families continue to struggle to pay their water bills on 
time, and low-income communities suffer from disproportionate 
vulnerabilities affecting their access to clean, affordable water 
services.
  Like heat and nutrition, which already have established Federal 
assistance programs, water is a vital and fundamental resource for 
public health and economic prosperity in all communities across the 
country. A permanent LIHWAP ensures we can continue to provide the 
necessary water assistance to low-income households at risk of losing 
access.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the LIHWAP 
Establishment Act as quickly as possible.

          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. PADILLA:
  S. 3830. A bill to authorize the Low-Income Household Water 
Assistance Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I rise to introduce the Low-Income 
Household Water Assistance Program Establishment Act or LIHWAP 
Establishment Act. This legislation would establish the first-ever 
permanent, national water assistance program to help low-income 
households pay their water bills.
  In 2021, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress provided 
$1.1 billion of critical assistance through the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2021 and American Rescue Plan of 2021 to low-
income households struggling to pay water and sewer bills. Since then,

[[Page S1046]]

LIHWAP has helped 1.4 million households across the country maintain or 
restore access to water service. However, LIHWAP was created as an 
emergency program and expired at the end of fiscal year 2023.
  Recognizing the importance of Federal water assistance, Congress 
passed the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act, which directed the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to create a Rural and Low-Income 
Water Assistance Pilot Program and report to Congress on the results of 
the pilot.
  The LIHWAP Establishment Act would provide the necessary 
congressional authorization for a permanent LIHWAP beyond the COVID-19 
emergency.
  The LIHWAP Establishment Act would direct the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, to 
establish a permanent low-income water assistance program. Just as the 
program did during the pandemic, LIHWAP would award grants to States, 
territories, and Tribes to assist low-income households in paying for 
drinking water or wastewater services.
  The bill would also empower nonprofit organizations to assist small, 
rural, underserved, and Tribal water systems apply for and access 
LIHWAP funding, as well as direct HHS to provide technical assistance 
to help agencies and water systems set up data sharing agreements to 
streamline eligibility requirements for low-income households.
  In addition, the bill would transfer authority for the program from 
HHS to the EPA upon completion of the EPA's Rural and Low-Income Water 
Assistance Pilot Program.
  Safeguarding water affordability for all Americans remains critical 
as household water and sewer bills rise faster than electric bills and 
inflation. Families continue to struggle to pay their water bills on 
time, and low-income communities suffer from disproportionate 
vulnerabilities affecting their access to clean, affordable water 
services.
  Like heat and nutrition, which already have established Federal 
assistance programs, water is a vital and fundamental resource for 
public health and economic prosperity in all communities across the 
country. A permanent LIHWAP ensures we can continue to provide the 
necessary water assistance to low-income households at risk of losing 
access.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the LIHWAP 
Establishment Act as quickly as possible.

                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 567--RECOGNIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF WIDESPREAD HEALTH 
  CARE WORKER BURNOUT IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN 
HEALTH WORKFORCE WELL-BEING, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION 
 OF MARCH 18, 2024, AS THE INAUGURAL ``HEALTH WORKFORCE WELL-BEING DAY 
                             OF AWARENESS''

  Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Capito, Ms. 
Stabenow, Ms. Collins, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Smith, Mr. King, Mr. Warner, 
Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Kelly) submitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions:

                              S. Res. 567

       Whereas the capacity and well-being of the United States 
     health workforce has been burdened for decades by an epidemic 
     of burnout, and this trend has been exacerbated in recent 
     years;
       Whereas burnout can have wide-ranging consequences for 
     individual health care workers, including occupational 
     injury, risk of depression and suicide, lower morale and 
     productivity, absenteeism, and possible deleterious impact on 
     patient care;
       Whereas 50 percent of health care workers reported burnout 
     in 2020;
       Whereas, in 2020, 44 percent of nurses experienced physical 
     violence and 68 percent experienced verbal abuse;
       Whereas, in 2020, 69 percent of physicians experienced 
     colloquial depression, 20 percent experienced clinical 
     depression, and 13 percent had thoughts of suicide;
       Whereas physicians, particularly female physicians, are 
     more likely than the general population to die by suicide, 
     and United States physicians are more likely to die by 
     suicide than physicians in other nations;
       Whereas rates of burnout have serious consequences for the 
     capacity of the United States health system, particularly in 
     regard to employee retention and recruitment;
       Whereas, in 2023, job quitting among health care and social 
     assistance workers was 9.2 percent higher than in February 
     2020;
       Whereas approximately 40 percent of United States health 
     care workers plan to leave their current role within the next 
     5 years;
       Whereas the average operating margin for hospitals in the 
     United States was reduced by 130 percent between 2019 and 
     2020, driven in part by persistent labor shortages;
       Whereas staffing shortages and impacts of burnout on the 
     mental health and productivity of health care workers raise 
     serious concerns about quality of care and patient safety;
       Whereas the decreased capacity of the United States health 
     system constitutes both a serious public health concern and a 
     challenge to economic security;
       Whereas, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
     and Health launched the Health Worker Mental Health 
     Initiative, which aims to raise awareness of health workers' 
     mental health issues and improve trainings and resources to 
     address the mental health of health workers;
       Whereas, in 2022, Congress enacted the Dr. Lorna Breen 
     Health Care Provider Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 294s et seq.), 
     which established grants and required other activities to 
     improve mental and behavioral health among health care 
     providers;
       Whereas, in 2022, the Office of the Surgeon General 
     published an Advisory on Addressing Health Worker Burnout to 
     call attention to the health worker burnout crisis and to the 
     urgent need to support the well-being of the health workforce 
     of the United States;
       Whereas, in 2022, the National Academy of Medicine released 
     the National Plan for Health Workforce Well-Being, 
     delineating necessary actions to safeguard the United States 
     health workforce; and
       Whereas a more robust national focus on protecting the 
     well-being and mental health of health care workers will 
     improve outcomes for workers and patients, strengthen the 
     United States health system, and support population health: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) expresses support for the designation of March 18, 
     2024, as the inaugural ``Health Workforce Well-Being Day of 
     Awareness'';
       (2) recognizes the seriousness of widespread health care 
     worker burnout in the United States and the need to 
     strengthen health workforce well-being; and
       (3) supports the goals and ideals of the Health Workforce 
     Well-Being Day of Awareness, which include--
       (A) raising public awareness about the importance of 
     protecting the well-being of physicians, nurses, and other 
     health care professionals to sustain the capacity of the 
     United States health system and ensure the quality of patient 
     care;
       (B) mobilizing action to support the well-being of 
     physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals 
     across multiple sectors, including Federal, State, and local 
     governments, health systems, insurers and payers, health 
     information technology companies, educational, training, and 
     accreditation organizations, private and nonprofit 
     organizations, media and communications companies, and 
     organizations that employ health care workers;
       (C) creating and sustaining positive work and learning 
     environments and culture;
       (D) investing in measurement, assessment, strategies, and 
     research;
       (E) supporting mental and behavioral health, including 
     removing barriers to accessing care and treatment, and 
     reducing stigma;
       (F) engaging effective tools and technology that reduce 
     administrative burdens on physicians, nurses, and other 
     health care professionals;
       (G) establishing well-being as a long-term value in health 
     organizations; and
       (H) recruiting and retaining a diverse and inclusive health 
     workforce.

       Whereas public education is a significant institution in a 
     21st-century democracy;

[[Page S1047]]

       Whereas public schools in the United States educate 
     students about the values and beliefs that hold the 
     individuals of the United States together as a nation;
       Whereas public schools prepare young individuals of the 
     United States to contribute to the society, economy, and 
     citizenry of the country;
       Whereas 90 percent of children in the United States attend 
     public schools;
       Whereas Federal, State, and local lawmakers should--
       (1) prioritize support for strengthening the public schools 
     of the United States;
       (2) empower superintendents, principals, and other school 
     leaders to implement, manage, and lead school districts and 
     schools in partnership with educators, parents, and other 
     local education stakeholders; and
       (3) support services and programs that are critical to 
     helping students engage in learning, including counseling, 
     extracurricular activities, and mental health support;
       Whereas public schools should foster inclusive, safe, and 
     high-quality environments in which children can learn to 
     think critically, problem solve, and build relationships;
       Whereas public schools should provide environments in which 
     all students have the opportunity to succeed beginning in 
     their earliest years, regardless of who a student is or where 
     a student lives;
       Whereas Congress should support--
       (1) efforts to advance equal opportunity and excellence in 
     public education;
       (2) efforts to implement evidence-based practices in public 
     education; and
       (3) continuous improvements to public education;

       Whereas every child should--
       (1) receive an education that helps the child reach the 
     full potential of the child; and
       (2) attend a school that offers a high-quality educational 
     experience;
       Whereas Federal funding, in addition to State and local 
     funds, supports the access of students to inviting 
     classrooms, well-prepared educators, and services to support 
     healthy students, including nutrition and afterschool 
     programs;
       Whereas teachers, paraprofessionals, and principals should 
     provide students with a well-rounded education and strive to 
     create joy in learning;
       Whereas superintendents, principals, other school leaders, 
     teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents make public schools 
     vital components of communities and are working hard to 
     improve educational outcomes for children across the country; 
     and
       Whereas the week of February 26 through March 1, 2024, is 
     an appropriate period to designate as ``Public Schools 
     Week'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of February 
     26 through March 1, 2024, as ``Public Schools Week''.

                                 PEACE

  Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I rise tonight in anguish and in sorrow 
over the heinous and horrific attack by Hamas on the people of Israel 
on October 7 and also in response to the catastrophic humanitarian 
nightmare unfolding on the ground in Gaza right now, leaving over 100 
Israeli hostages and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians suffering 
and tens of thousands--including many women and children--already dead, 
with no end in sight.
  While much can be said about the geopolitics, perhaps because I am a 
pastor, I see first and foremost the people. On all sides of this awful 
and ugly, deadly conflict, I see the children of God. All of us are 
children of God. I especially see the children.
  The haunting and penetrating witness of that ancient woman of the 
Jewish Scripture speaks to me in this moment. A voice is heard in 
Ramah, the sound of mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her 
children, and she refuses to be comforted, for they are no more.
  I hear Jewish mothers and fathers and Palestinian mothers and fathers 
weeping for their children, and the question is, What would we do if we 
truly believed that all of the children are truly our children? What 
would each side do if they could look into the eyes of the children on 
the other side and see in those children's eyes what they see when they 
look into the eyes of their own?
  When we come to see that the safety of other people's children is 
inextricably connected to the safety of our own, we will do so much 
more to ensure that all children are safe. When we come to see that the 
health of other people's children is inexorably related to the health 
of our own, we will do so much more to ensure that every child can eat. 
When we come to see that the future of all children is tied to our 
children's future, we will ensure that every child can learn, play, 
imagine, and grow. We will hasten toward that path that leads to peace.
  In that spirit, I rise tonight to explain why I think we have reached 
an inflection point in this conflict, one that demands all involved 
redouble our efforts to get a cease-fire and ultimately a just and 
sustainable peace.
  I do not mean to suggest that any of this is simple. Indeed, if it 
were simple, it would have been resolved a long time ago. The issues of 
the Middle East are complicated. They are age-old and seemingly 
intractable. We live in a dangerous world, rife with conflict and 
replete with enemies who do not want to see peace.
  October 7 was a tragic reminder. Hamas, a brutal terrorist 
organization that has the total destruction of Israel etched in its 
charter documents and ensconced in its mission, perpetrated the most 
devastating attack we have seen on the Jewish people since the 
Holocaust. Some 787 civilians were killed, more than 1,100 if you count 
security personnel. Unbridled brutality and cruelty were visited upon 
seniors and women and children. Among those taken as hostages were 
young people simply enjoying a concert. Rape and sexual assaults were 
used as a weapon of war. Such depraved and immoral acts are rightly 
condemned by all who believe in human dignity and freedom.
  Our ally Israel lives in a dangerous neighborhood, and it has a right 
to defend itself. That is why I was proud to support the national 
security supplemental in the Senate. It needs to pass in the House. It 
provides $5.2 billion for missile defenses like the Iron Dome, but it 
also provides $9 billion in humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza and 
in other places.
  Moreover, it supplies urgently needed aid to Ukraine--a sovereign, 
democratic state viciously attacked by Putin's Russia. We stand with 
Ukraine. Their vital national security interests are tied to our own.
  Putin, the old KGB agent with fond memories of the old Soviet Union, 
will not stop his murderous march with Ukraine. He will threaten other 
NATO allies. Because of NATO's article 5 protection, which states that 
an attack on one is an attack on all, that could well draw us in.
  Last week, I participated in the Munich Security Conference. While we 
rightly urged our allies to put more skin in the game, as they should, 
to increase their own commitment to their own security--and to be sure, 
some of them are stepping up--the truth is, there is no replacement for 
American leadership in the world.
  We, alongside our allies, must stand with Ukraine. In a broken and 
dangerous world like ours, evil has to be constrained, tyranny rejected 
sometimes by force. I would rather send military support to Ukrainian 
soldiers in their valiant defense of their homeland and of Europe today 
than send American soldiers to that fight tomorrow. It is not only the 
right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do for our own national 
security interest.
  If we are speaking of Ukraine or Israel, ultimately the aim must 
always be peace--a sustainable peace, a just peace, the kind of peace 
that must be rigorously pursued with both a tough mind and a tender 
heart.
  I pray for peace for the people of Ukraine, for the suffering people 
of Sudan, for Israeli children and Palestinian children. They are all 
children of God.
  I think of the story of 13-year-old Ariel Zohar, an Israeli teenager 
who lost both of his parents and his two older sisters when Hamas 
attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz just 2 months before his bar mitzvah. Ariel 
just happened to be out for a run, and he sought shelter with a kibbutz 
security guard. That is the only reason--the only reason--young Ariel 
survived. May God bless the memory of Ariel's family and the security 
guard, who also died at the hands of Hamas. He survived, but a 13-year-
old child must now live with this trauma. It is a trauma that I know 
Jewish people in Georgia and around the world are living with every 
day.
  The tragic irony is that in the wake of October 7, anti-Semitism has 
actually gone up. In this country, anti-Semitism has gone up. All of 
this is now witnessed through the prism of a people who have never 
truly felt safe in the world, people who carry the burden of history--
centuries of it--in their bones.
  I got a sense of it in recent weeks as I sat with the families of 
hostages being held by Hamas. I sat with those families, who were 
stunned by the nightmare of their reality, people who have no idea when 
or how their family members might return.
  I recall meeting with one father who was lamenting what had happened 
on October 7 to his daughter and his son-in-law when they were attacked 
by Hamas. Beyond his grief, here is what he wanted to know. He wanted 
to know: Does anybody other than us understand? Do they get it? Can 
they see what we see, hear what we hear, feel what we feel?
  And as he said that with such pain and pathos in his voice, he was 
speaking about his own family, but he just as well could have been 
speaking for the family of 13-year-old Donia Abu Mohsen, a Palestinian 
girl who lost her parents and two brothers in an Israeli missile strike 
in south Gaza and had to have her leg amputated. And while she was 
recovering in the hospital, she was tragically killed by another 
Israeli airstrike while in the hospital.
  May God bless the memory of Donia and her family. Donia is one of 
more than 12,000 children and tens of thousands of defenseless 
Palestinians who reportedly have been killed since Israel has been 
prosecuting its war against Hamas.

[[Page S1049]]

  There is an acronym used in Gaza: WCNSF, wounded child with no 
surviving family. According to media reports, an estimated 17,000 
Palestinian children fall under that category: wounded child with no 
surviving family. And another 2 million Palestinians have been 
displaced by the effort to rid the world of Hamas.
  When I meet with my Palestinian and Muslim constituents in Georgia, 
members of our human family, I also hear them wonder: Does anybody 
other than us understand? Do they see what we see? Do they hear what we 
hear? Can they feel what we feel? Does anybody care?
  The staggering loss of Palestinian lives should deeply trouble all of 
us, but equally concerning is the serious humanitarian catastrophe that 
is unfolding in Gaza before our very eyes. Earlier this week, the U.N. 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said during a 
briefing that about one quarter of the population in Gaza--576,000 
people--are ``one step away from famine'' and facing a ``grave 
situation.'' Diseases like hepatitis A and digestive illnesses are 
spreading rapidly in overcrowded, makeshift camps, and this is made 
worse by a lack of access to clean water or sanitation systems.
  Families right now are huddled in makeshift tents and other shelters, 
exposed to the winter elements, with everything they can carry on their 
backs. The medical system in Gaza has collapsed, with only a handful of 
hospitals still partially functioning.
  On average, reportedly, more than 10 children have lost one or both 
of their legs every day since October 7, with many of those amputations 
performed without anesthesia. Pregnant women in Gaza have experienced a 
300-percent increase in miscarriages.
  And, most recently, the Netanyahu administration has once again 
ordered displaced Palestinians--women, children, seniors, regular 
civilians already pushed out of their homes by war--to evacuate 
territory they were told would be safe after fleeing previous 
offensives by the IDF in northern Gaza.
  If Mr. Netanyahu advances military operations into Rafah, the 
question is: Where are these people supposed to go? What will be the 
human consequences?
  World-class epidemiologists tell us that with an escalation of the 
war into Rafah, as many as 85,000 Palestinians could die from injuries 
and disease over the next 6 months--85,000 on top of the already 
mounting death toll. I submit that such a move would be unconscionable 
and morally indefensible.
  But what do we do about Hamas, a terrorist organization bent on 
Israel's destruction? Let me be clear: Israel would be better off, the 
Palestinian people would be better off, the world would be better off 
without Hamas. But Hamas is more than a terrorist organization. It is 
an ideology. It is a mindset. It is a way of thinking that sits in a 
place deeper than the tunnels beneath Gaza. And if the legacy of 
Hamas's violence on October 7 becomes continuing and escalating 
indiscriminate violence in turn, then the destructive ideology of Hamas 
will have won the day.
  We must not let them win. We must be careful not to create, through 
indiscriminate killing, that which we seek to destroy. We must find a 
more excellent way. With a tough mind and a tender heart, we must find 
that way that leads to peace.
  We are at an inflection point, a place where two ways meet, and time 
is running out. I call upon Israel and Hamas to come to a negotiated 
cease-fire, with the immediate release of hostages and opening of 
humanitarian corridors so that food, medicine, water, and other 
supplies can be delivered to the people of Gaza with the fierce urgency 
that the situation demands. I am heartened by the quiet, steady work of 
the Biden administration and our regional partners in this effort, and 
I urge that it continue in earnest.
  Furthermore, we must reaffirm our unwavering commitment to a two-
state solution. The people of Israel deserve to live in peace and 
security alongside their neighbors. I agree with Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., who said that ``Israel's right to exist as a state in 
security is incontestable. The whole world,'' he said, ``must see that 
Israel must exist and has the right to exist.''

  The dignity of self-determination is among the values he was seeking 
to uphold. Israelis deserve it. So do Palestinians. Two peoples, two 
states, living alongside one another in freedom and in peace--that must 
remain our North Star.
  And if we would be true to our values, we must call to task any 
politician who would reject that right to self-determination, 
especially if that rejection comes while, at the same time, one is 
engaged in massive and indiscriminate bombing of the very same people.
  From the ugly and dangerous specter of it all, the world cannot and 
must not turn away. With the Muslim holy days of Ramadan around the 
corner and the Jewish Passover shortly thereafter, we are at an 
inflection point, a place where two traumatized peoples meet. As a 
Black man who stands in Dr. King's pulpit, I know a little something 
about trauma. I know that while our trauma informs us, it must never 
define us. We are more than what has happened to us. We have within our 
capacity the strength to write a new story.
  We must pursue peace, seek justice, embrace mercy, and struggle for 
human dignity with all of our might. The children on each side and all 
of our children are counting on us to do no less. I would wonder what 
we would actually do if we truly believed that all of the children are 
our children. As a parent with small children, I wonder what would each 
side do if they could look into the eyes of the children on the other 
side and see in those children's eyes what they see when they look into 
the eyes of their own.
  Perhaps this is what the prophet Isaiah was getting at when he put 
forth his extraordinary vision, and I lift it up.

       The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie 
     down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling 
     together, and a little child shall lead them.

  Honestly, I never quite understood what Isaiah meant. It seems too 
idyllic and other-worldly even for the preacher. But perhaps the 
prophet is saying something much more practical than we think.
  To be sure, peacemaking is not easy work at all, by any stretch of 
the imagination. But perhaps when we allow our children and our love 
for our children, our concern for their future, and our children's 
inextricable connection to all other children to lead us--when we allow 
the children to lead us--we will find ourselves on the path that leads 
to peace.
  So, tonight, I pray for a world where Israeli mothers and fathers and 
Palestinian mothers and fathers can put their children to bed in peace, 
say their bedtime prayers, and awaken to a world where they are finally 
safe.
  Madam President, I yield the floor.

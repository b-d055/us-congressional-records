                       Business Before the Senate

  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we are back in the Senate and kicking 
off a new year, which will undoubtedly be busy and certainly 
challenging. There is a lot of work for us to do, and one of our most 
crucial tasks is to address the national security supplemental 
appropriations bill that President Biden has requested.
  As you know, that bill includes relief for not only Israel but also 
additional

[[Page S12]]

assistance to Ukraine and provides additional money for the Indo-
Pacific--hopefully to deter potential Chinese aggression in that 
region--and, of course, the border, which is another story for another 
day.
  But today, I would like to talk about the challenges we face in the 
Middle East. Today, the global threat environment is unlike any we have 
seen in recent memory, perhaps in our lifetime.
  I just returned from a trip to the Middle East with a bipartisan 
group of colleagues from the Senate Intelligence Committee. We had an 
extremely busy schedule, but it was very productive. We had 22 separate 
meetings with leaders across the region, from Jordan to Saudi Arabia, 
to Israel.
  We also had the opportunity, as I indicated, to travel to Israel to 
meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Minister of Defense, Galant, 
and also members of the intelligence community there in Tel Aviv--the 
Shin Bet, which is responsible for domestic security, and, of course, 
Mossad, the legendary intelligence agency of the Israeli Government.
  We all know that on October 7, the world shifted and changed in a 
dramatic way in Israel when Hamas entered Israel by air, land, and sea. 
They committed horrific acts of murder of babies and children and 
innocent civilians. They raped and tortured and beheaded innocent 
people--beheaded innocent people. They dismembered the bodies of their 
victims and captured hostages to use as human shields and bargaining 
chips. It was a day of infamy that will live in the minds of Israelis 
for the rest of their lives, and it should be a warning again--if we 
need another warning--to the rest of the region and the rest of the 
world.
  For the people of Israel, this was not unlike our experience on 
September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 Americans were killed by a 
terrorist attack here in Washington, DC, and, of course, the plane lost 
in Pennsylvania when brave passengers on that plane prevented an 
attack, perhaps on the very Capitol Building here in Washington. Of 
course, on September 11, thousands of families lost husbands, wives, 
parents, and children because of evil terrorists in pursuit of a 
fanatical ideology. That is what Israel experienced 3 months ago.
  Compared to the United States, of course, Israel is a very small 
country. It is home to roughly 9.3 million people. I represent a State 
of 30 million people. So Israel has roughly about a third of the 
population of the State of Texas. But in Israel on that day, October 7, 
the lives of 1,200 people were lost. Based on the population, this 
would be equivalent to roughly 36,000 Americans dying on 9/11--an 
absolutely mind-boggling thought.
  Just as most Americans can remember where they were and what they 
were doing on that terrible day of 9/11/2001, nearly every single 
Israeli who is old enough to remember the attack will forever recall 
the events of that terrible day. They will never--they will never--
forget the pain that their country and their people have endured and 
the threat to their very existence that terrorist attack represents.
  As might be expected, I am proud to say that over the last 3 months, 
the United States has stood strongly in support of Israel--one of our 
closest allies; the only democracy, really, in the Middle East. We 
provided military assistance and repeatedly affirmed that Israel has a 
nonnegotiable right to defend itself.
  In recent months, as has occurred throughout America's history, some 
Americans have voiced skepticism: Why should we care? Why should 
America be involved in these conflicts so far away from our shores? 
They ask, and it is a fair question: Why should we care about the 
outcome of a war that is happening thousands of miles away? Given the 
challenges we face here at home, they ask, why should the United States 
invest in Israel's victory and the defense of Ukraine against the 
invasion by Russia? The threats that are occurring in the Indo-
Pacific--why should we care about those threats?
  Well, the answer when it comes to Israel is simple: Terrorism will 
not be confined to Israel or the Middle East as a region. What happens 
there will not stay there.
  Now, I know that sometimes we have to relearn the lessons we learned 
the hard way many years ago, but the lesson of 9/11 is that our oceans, 
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, do not protect the United States 
against terrorist attacks on our own soil. That is the hard lesson we 
learned on 9/11, and we should not forget it.
  The evil that the world witnessed on October 7 is not limited to 
Hamas. Hamas, of course, is a terrorist organization committed to the 
destruction of Israel and the elimination of the Israeli people from 
the map. This is a sickness, a perversion of a great religion that is 
shared by terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East.
  But we should not be distracted by looking at just Hamas because it 
is Iran that is the head of the octopus. Its tentacles of terror--its 
proxies--extend throughout the region and threaten to destabilize the 
Middle East and potentially start a much larger war.
  Iran's terrorist proxies include not only Hamas but also Hezbollah in 
Lebanon, to the north of Israel; the Houthis in Yemen, on the Arabian 
Peninsula; the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza and the West Bank; 
and, of course the Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq, who have 
attempted as many as 100 different attacks on American troops and 
America's interests in the region. Iran provides these groups with 
funding and with weapons and training to enable these attacks like the 
one that was committed by Hamas on Israel.
  But that is only one example. Iranian-led proxies in Iraq and Syria 
are attacking U.S. forces, as I said. Hezbollah is launching consistent 
assaults on northern Israel. The Houthis are disrupting global commerce 
and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, as well as launching unmanned 
aerial vehicles in an attempt to essentially assault and bomb Israel.
  Iran is a country driven by an ideology that calls for the 
destruction of Israel, but Iran would not stop there.
  The Supreme Leader of Iran once labeled the United States as Iran's 
``No. 1 enemy.'' We see that view borne into action today as Iran 
supports Russia in its ongoing war on the people of Ukraine and through 
its strategic cooperation with China.
  Yes, this war is about the future of Israel, but it is also about the 
future of Iran. Tehran stands to gain a lot from Hamas's war against 
the Israelis, and the United States must continue to stand for the 
unequivocal defeat of Hamas. Anything less would embolden Iran and its 
terrorist proxies and aid them in their ambitions for regional 
hegemony.
  Our colleagues are working hard to reach an agreement on a national 
security supplemental appropriations bill that will include aid for 
four security national priorities, as I mentioned: Israel, Ukraine, the 
Indo-Pacific, and the southern border.
  When it comes to Israel, some want to set conditions on U.S. aid and 
thus attempt to micromanage Israel's fight for its very survival. This, 
I would suggest, is nothing but hubris, plain and simple.
  Imagine if other countries tried to tell the United States how we 
should have conducted our fight against al-Qaida after 9/11, right 
after the smoke had cleared and after the bodies of 3,000 Americans had 
been buried; if other countries had told us ``No, you can't go after 
the terrorists' threat this way; you have to do it that way.'' Our 
Nation had just lost 3,000 innocent lives through a series of terrorist 
attacks. Imagine if others tried to dictate the means by which we 
defeated that threat and protected our country. Would we have allowed 
them to tie our hands when it comes to our own defense? Absolutely not. 
We would have chided them for their naivety and dismissed any attempt 
to treat terrorist organizations with kid gloves or to treat them as a 
rational power.
  A number of Americans are concerned--we are all concerned, I would 
suggest--by the number of civilian casualties in Gaza.
  But the primary cause of civilian casualties in Gaza and in Israel is 
Hamas, the terrorist organization. There is no question that when war 
is declared as Hamas declared war against Israel on October 7, that 
innocent people will be hurt, perhaps even killed. But there is no 
question that Hamas's own tactics are the reason the loss of life in 
Gaza is so high.
  These terrorists have a long history of using Palestinian civilians 
as human

[[Page S13]]

shields to protect themselves. Hamas operates a vast network of tunnels 
beneath Gaza--some 500 kilometers by one estimate--and they shield 
their terrorist overlords in those tunnels from the dangerous fighting 
above ground. This is where they store critical supplies like water, 
food, and fuel, which are being kept from the Palestinian civilians who 
need that humanitarian assistance. It seems likely that these tunnels 
are the hiding place for more than 130 remaining hostages.
  I met with the grieving families here in Dallas, TX, who lost loved 
ones to this conflict on October 7, whose loved ones are hostages of 
Hamas today in Israel. And we also met with another group of Americans 
who have family members who are currently hostages of Hamas in Gaza.
  Well, a video was shared online of a Hamas gunman who was captured 
and interrogated by Israeli officials. He said that Hamas shelters in 
tunnels and basements under clinics, schools, and hospitals because 
they know the Israelis will not target those locations because of their 
concern about collateral damage and the injury and, perhaps, death of 
innocent people. So Hamas deliberately places innocent Palestinians 
between its terrorist foot soldiers and incoming rockets.
  We should remember that it was Hamas that initiated this war with 
their brutal massacre of Israeli civilians, including women and 
children--even infants--that were just going about their daily lives 
that represented no threat to them. It is Hamas that knowingly uses the 
Palestinian people as human shields. It is Hamas that rejoices at every 
Palestinian killed because it broadens their support and strengthens 
their narrative and helps them recruit more support.
  The world should not condemn Israel for defending itself against 
terrorist attacks, just like the world did not condemn the United 
States when we defended ourselves against al-Qaida following the 
terrorist attacks of 9/11. The world should condemn Hamas for its 
indiscriminate use of civilian infrastructure to protect its own foot 
soldiers.
  As the fighting continues, we can't lose sight of the jarring 
difference between two sides of this conflict. There is no moral 
equivalence between Israel and the terrorist organization known as 
Hamas or, as I mentioned earlier, the head of the octopus, which is the 
regime in Iran.
  This is not a battle between two nations. This is a battle between 
good and evil. Additional assistance for Israel is crucial to not only 
the future of the Jewish State but to the stability of the region and 
the future ambitions of Iran. If Hamas emerges from this war with 
nothing more than a black eye, it will send a message to Iran and its 
terrorist proxies that their war against Israel and the Western world 
is worthwhile. And it will continue and it will intensify and it will 
expand.
  Given the chaos that is unfolding in the Middle East today, the very 
last thing the world needs is an emboldened Iran. I hope in the coming 
weeks, the Senate can finally make progress on the need for assistance 
for Israel. The House passed an Israel aid bill on November 2--November 
2, more than 2 months ago--and the Senate has done nothing except 
preach to Israel on the means by which some believe it should defend 
itself from those determined to wipe it from the face of the Earth.
  This is not a time for preaching to Israel, our most steadfast ally 
in the Middle East, about how to defend themselves. It is a grave 
disservice, I believe, to do so.
  So there is a lot at stake, and the eyes of the world are on the 
United States. Again, as I said earlier, no American wants to see us 
involved in conflicts around the world. But, unfortunately, it is our 
responsibility, not just because we come to the aid of others who have 
been innocent civilians and people who have been viciously attacked by 
terrorists but because this virus, this contagion, will spread beyond 
Israel, beyond the Middle East, and to other parts of the world, 
including the United States.
  If there is a lesson we learned from 
9/11, it is that our oceans--the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans--will not 
protect us. So what happens in Gaza, what happens in Israel will not 
stay there.
  Taking action to ensure our top ally in the Middle East has its back 
would be a great place for us to start this new year. The clock is 
ticking, and the Senate needs to act soon to ensure that Israel has 
what it needs to defeat Hamas and confront the growing threat from 
Iran.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Butler). The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Ms. DUCKWORTH. I also ask unanimous consent for the scheduled vote to 
begin immediately.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                      RECOGNIZING AERO RACE WHEELS

<bullet> Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize 
an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American 
entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize AERO 
Race Wheels of Estherville, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week.
  AERO Race Wheels was founded by racing wheel manufacturing legend 
F.L. ``Skip'' Miller. Since 1995, AERO Race Wheels of Estherville, IA, 
has been a premier dirt and asphalt track wheel manufacturer. Skip took 
ownership of the company in 1998 with his wife Diane and moved their 
facilities to the current Estherville location in the same year. AERO 
Race Wheels offers a variety of racing wheels at an affordable price 
that are distributed throughout the United States and raced across the 
world. The steel wheels they manufacture are available in a variety of 
finishes and can be driven on asphalt, dirt, or both types of tracks.
  AERO Race Wheels has played a key part in the history of NASCAR. From 
1997 until 2021, AERO Race Wheels provided the steel racing wheels for 
the premier NASCAR Cup Series. Their 59 Series Wheel continues to be 
the wheel of choice for NASCAR's Grand National, Truck Series, and ARCA 
Series. NASCAR Hall of Famers Richard Petty, Jimmie Johnson, and the 
late Dale Earnhardt, Sr., have all raced with AERO Race Wheels during 
their respective careers.
  AERO Race Wheels is actively involved in the Estherville community. 
They are a member of the Estherville Chamber of Commerce and have been 
involved in the Avera Holy Family Hospital for several years. They have 
also been recognized for their contributions to the Iowa economy. In 
2003, they received the Iowa Area Development Group's--IADG--Venture 
Award and were named a member of the IADG hall of fame. In 2023, AERO 
Race Wheels celebrated its 28th business anniversary.
  AERO Race Wheel's commitment to providing high-quality racing wheels 
for the love of the sport is clear. I want to congratulate Skip and 
Diane Miller and the entire team at AERO Race Wheels for their amazing 
dedication to the racing industry. I look forward to seeing their 
continued growth and success.<bullet>

        RECOGNIZING THE JACKSONVILLE-ONSLOW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

<bullet> Mr. BUDD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 
Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of Commerce on their 80th anniversary.
  Since being established in 1944, the Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of 
Commerce has been a staunch advocate for area businesses and the Marine 
Corps community at Camp Lejeune. Jacksonville is well-known for being 
the home of Camp Lejeune. Its community is also deeply entrenched in 
supporting small-business owners.
  Chambers of Commerce play a pivotal role in areas around workforce 
development, tourism promotion, connecting business owners, and 
advocating for issues that are important to their members. The 
Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber routinely performs all of these duties and 
has consistently gone the extra mile to help build new partnerships in 
the area.
  A strong chamber oftentimes requires a visionary and bold leader at 
the helm. Laurette Leagon has over 25 years as a chamber professional 
and is widely recognized in Southeastern North Carolina as an 
innovative thought leader. At her core, she has never forgotten what 
one of the most important functions of a chamber is: to do what is best 
for membership.
  Mr. President, I congratulate the Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of 
Commerce on their 80th anniversary. I have no doubt that this 
organization will continue to advocate and advance the interests of 
small businesses, non-profits, and other industry members for decades 
to come.<bullet>

        RECOGNIZING THE GREATER FAYETTEVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

<bullet> Mr. BUDD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Greater 
Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce on their 125th anniversary.
  While it has been operated under various names over the years, the 
Greater Fayetteville Chamber has roots that date back to 1899. 
Fayetteville is known nationally as a community that is not only home 
to the largest Active-Duty military base in the United States, but also 
thriving businesses.
  Chambers of commerce play a pivotal role in areas around workforce 
development, tourism promotion, connecting businessowners, and 
advocating for issues that are important to their members. As North 
Carolina's sixth largest city, many have taken notice of the success 
stories happening in Fayetteville and Cumberland County.
  Since being named CEO of the Greater Fayetteville Chamber back in 
March 2023, Nat Robertson has been a passionate force driving the 
area's economic competitiveness. He came into office with a bold agenda 
focused on membership growth, business advocacy, and a true passion for 
improving his community. That energy has helped the chamber grow at a 
rapid pace in its membership, community involvement, and events that 
bring together a diverse group of citizens within the community.
  I congratulate the Greater Fayetteville Chamber on their 125th 
anniversary. I have no doubt that this organization will continue to 
advocate and advance the interests of small businesses, nonprofits, and 
other industry members for decades to come.<bullet>

                        RECOGNIZING FAMILY FOODS

<bullet> Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize 
an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American 
entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize 
Family Foods of Tipton, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
  Family Foods was founded by Don Goetz in 1964 under the name Don's 
Big Value after purchasing the building location from his then-
employer, the Benner Tea Company grocery store. Don started working at 
Benner Tea Company at the age of 14 and became the store's manager at 
the age of 18. From 1952 until 1954, Don served in the U.S. Marine 
Corps during the Korean war. In its early history, the store's name was 
changed from Don's Big Value to Giant Foods until 1976, when the 
business adopted the Family Foods name. In 1985, Family Foods moved 
from its original location to 610 Cedar Street in Tipton. The store has 
seen two major renovation projects over the years, one in 1990 and the 
other in 2015.
  Family Foods is an exemplary family business. In 2010, Don's son Mike 
Goetz purchased the store. Three generations of the Goetz family have 
worked at the Family Foods in Tipton, with Mike's son Brad now serving 
as co-owner. Many associates at the store have been part of the team 
for decades. Don Goetz passed away in 2017, leaving behind a legacy of 
service, hard work, and dedication to his community.
  The Family Foods team is actively involved in the Tipton community 
and have been recognized for their service. Brad previously served on 
the Tipton Community School District Board, and Mike served as the 
Tipton Chamber of Commerce president. Brad currently serves on the 
Tipton School Foundation Board.
  In 2017, Brad was nationally recognized for his community service as 
the Eastern Iowa representative at the Jefferson Awards in Washington, 
DC. The Jefferson Awards are a national awards ceremony held annually 
celebrating community service and the people

helping their communities. While they were in Washington, Senator 
Grassley and I had the opportunity to meet Brad and the Goetz family. 
Family Foods is also actively involved in the Tipton Rotary Club and 
has supported both the fine arts and athletics programs in Tipton. 
Family Foods celebrated its 59th business anniversary in 2023.
  Family Foods' commitment to providing quality groceries is clear. I 
want to congratulate Mike Goetz, Brad Goetz, and the entire team at 
Family Foods for their dedication to providing groceries and serving 
the Tipton community. I look forward to seeing their continued growth 
and success in Iowa.<bullet>

                       RECOGNIZING TILLIES QUILTS

<bullet> Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize 
an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American 
entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize 
Tillies Quilts of Fort Dodge, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week.
  Driven by her dream of owning her own quilt shop, Jo Seltz founded 
Tillies Quilts in 2011 to serve both expert and novice quilters in Fort 
Dodge and the surrounding communities. Jo and her husband Rich are 
staples of the Fort Dodge community, with the couple also owning the 
Dariette ice cream shop since 2008 and Ardys Mae Coffee and Dessert 
since 2022.
  Prior to opening Tillies Quilts, Jo spent over a decade as the youth 
director at St. Paul Lutheran Church from 1999 until 2010. Jo left her 
position at St. Paul Lutheran Church to focus on Tillies Quilts, aptly 
named after her Great Aunt Matilda ``Tillie'' Jacobs, who gifted Jo her 
first quilt. Tillies Quilts is a one-stop-shop for all of your quilting 
needs. They offer designer fabrics and patterns, quilt kits, quilt 
supplies, and quilting classes. Tillies Quilts also offers a block of 
the month club and hosts various social events. In February 2024, 
Tillies Quilts will host their Super Bowl Sunday quilting class where 
participants will make a 16-inch by 16-inch quilt block.
  In addition to owning Tillies Quilts, Jo and Rich Seltz are actively 
involved in the Fort Dodge community. Jo currently serves as the 
president of the Blanden Charitable Foundation board of trustees, an 
organization promoting the Blanden Art Museum in Fort Dodge. Jo also 
serves as a trustee on the Ann Smeltzer Charitable Trust, which 
promotes community involvement in the arts and preserves Fort Dodge's 
historic Ringland-Smeltzer home. Despite no longer serving as youth 
director, Jo has remained involved in the St. Paul Lutheran Church over 
the years. Tillies Quilts is a proud member of the Greater Fort Dodge 
Growth Alliance, and in 2023, the team celebrated their 12th business 
anniversary. Great Aunt Matilda ``Tillie'' Jacobs passed away in 1994, 
but her legacy of hard work, kindness, and passion for quilting is 
honored at Tillies Quilts.
  I want to congratulate Jo and Rich Seltz and the entire team at 
Tillies Quilts for their entrepreneurial spirit and diligent efforts to 
build a community for quilters in central Iowa. I look forward to 
seeing their continued growth and success.<bullet>

                   Recognition of the Majority Leader

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.


                    congratulating the buffalo bills

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, let me start out today by saying 
it is a great day to be a Buffalo Bills fan. For the fourth year in a 
row, the Buffalo Bills have won the AFC East championship, squishing 
the fish last night by defeating the Miami Dolphins 21 to 14. What an 
incredible night. What an incredible win. What an incredible team. 
Buffalo is truly the Beast of the East.
  It hasn't been the easiest season for the Bills, but this team can be 
summed up in one word: perseverance. They never gave up. They never 
threw in the towel. And last night, it began to pay off because they 
are on their way to the playoffs.
  In true Buffalo fashion, Bills Mafia showed up in the early hours of 
the morning at the Buffalo Airport to welcome their team home. And, of 
course, it seemed like half of the people at the Miami stadium were 
Bills fans as well.
  Congratulations to Buffalo. Congratulations to Coach Sean McDermott 
and the whole team as well. Let's keep going. And, as always, go Bills.


                       business before the senate

  Madam President, now on the new year, I would like to begin the 2nd 
session of the 118th Congress by wishing you and all of my colleagues a 
happy new year. I hope everyone was able to spend time with family, 
with friends, and meet constituents.

[[Page S6]]

  This past Christmas-New Year's recess, however, was a busy, 
consequential, and most of all a productive time for the U.S. Senate. 
Senators and staff worked straight through Christmas and straight 
through the new year on avoiding a government shutdown, on protecting 
America's security, even protecting the future of Western democracy, 
and we made some real progress.
  First, I have excellent news on government funding. Yesterday, I 
announced with Speaker Johnson that congressional leaders have reached 
a top-line agreement for government funding for the 2024 fiscal year. 
When we began our negotiations, our goal was to preserve a nondefense 
funding level of $772 billion--the same level agreed to in our debt 
ceiling deal last June. That $772 billion was precisely the number we 
reached. Not a nickel was cut. Again, our goal was $772 billion, and 
that is precisely the number we reached in this bipartisan agreement.
  The agreement now clears the way for Congress to act in the coming 
weeks to avoid a government shutdown, while also preserving key 
domestic programs that benefit millions of Americans. The framework 
agreement will enable the appropriators to address many of the major 
challenges Americans face at home and abroad. It also allows us to keep 
the investments for hard-working American families that congressional 
Democrats and President Biden secured through our legislative agenda.
  Both parties reached this agreement without resorting to the painful 
and draconian cuts that the hard right--particularly those in the 
Freedom Caucus--clamored for. The hard right wanted to put a chopping 
block on programs that help millions of Americans. So I am happy to say 
that Democrats protected vital priorities like housing programs, 
veterans' benefits, healthcare, nutrition programs, small business 
support, the National Health Service--the NHS--and funding for Federal 
law enforcement.
  I am particularly pleased that we will protect the historic climate 
investment Democrats passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. The hard 
right wanted to use the appropriations process to undo our climate 
investments. Democrats said no, and we held the line.
  The hard right also wanted to make cuts to the IRS so that the 
ultrarich tax cheats could weasel their way out of paying their fair 
share. By keeping the cuts at $20 billion, I am happy to say this 
agreement will not affect the IRS's ability to keep holding the richest 
tax cheats accountable. Remember, when Democrats passed the Inflation 
Reduction Act, we gave the IRS new tools to audit the richest of the 
rich who don't pay their fair share. All these tools will remain in 
place.
  So this top-line agreement is an excellent start to the year because 
it is a huge step towards avoiding a government shutdown. Of course, 
our work must continue. Producing 12 appropriations bills will not be 
easy. It is going to require agreement from the four corners and a lot 
more compromise between the parties.
  And make no mistake--Democrats have made clear to Speaker Johnson 
that we will not support the inclusion of any poison pills in any of 
the 12 appropriations bills before the Congress. In a statement that 
Leader Jeffries and I put out yesterday, we made it clear that we will 
not accept poison pills. If the hard right chooses to spoil this 
agreement with poison pills, they will be to blame if we start 
careening towards a shutdown. I know Speaker Johnson has said that 
nobody wants to see a shutdown happen.
  Finally, thank you to my colleagues on both sides in both Chambers 
who made this agreement possible. I want to particularly thank my 
staff, who worked morning, noon, and night over the past few weeks. I 
must have spoken to them 10, 12 times a day every day and even several 
times on Christmas Day because getting this done was so important.
  The next few weeks are not going to be easy, but the Democrats--we 
Democrats--are committed to working as hard as we can to avoid a 
government shutdown.
  I hope our Republican colleagues, particularly in the House--we have 
good cooperation here in the Senate--are ready to do the same.

                           National Security

  Madam President, on the supplemental, in addition to fully funding 
the Federal Government, Senators have also been hard at work over the 
winter break on finalizing an emergency national security supplemental. 
The supplemental package is a national necessity, with critical aid to 
help Ukraine defeat Putin, help Israel combat Hamas, provide needed 
assistance to innocent civilians in Gaza, and fix our broken 
immigration system.
  At the end of last year, I said Democrats would remain committed to 
finding a bipartisan agreement on the supplemental. The only way to get 
something done on an issue as hard as the border is through bipartisan 
cooperation, and we have kept our promise to work in good faith.
  Now, on the supplemental, it has been a very promising few days. We 
have made more progress in the past couple of days on the border than 
we have in the past few weeks. The work is not yet finished, but I am 
more hopeful right now--even more than I was a few days ago--that we 
can get something meaningful done on the border and pass the 
supplemental.
  Getting over the finish line is still not going to be easy. It will 
take continued compromise, good faith, and recognition from both sides 
that nobody is going to get everything they want.
  Immigration reform has always been one of the hardest issues facing 
the Senate. But our broken border and our national security are at 
stake in this supplemental, and we must do everything we can to reach 
an agreement.
  I urge my colleagues to continue their negotiations, and I want to 
thank them all for their good work to bring us to this point. Their 
example is an affirmation that the only way to get things done is 
through bipartisanship. So I urge them to stay the course until the 
work is done.

                     Anniversary of January 6, 2021

  Madam President, now, on the January 6 anniversary, 3 years ago--on 
January 6, 2021--America experienced one of the darkest, most infamous 
days in our Nation's history. The Capitol we stand in right now became 
the target of mob violence. Our democracy fell under attack, 
orchestrated and encouraged by Donald Trump and fueled by the Big Lie.
  Three years can pass, 5 years can pass, a decade can pass, but 
January 6 will always seem like yesterday to me. At one point, I was 
within 30 feet of the rioters, who I was told were shouting, ``Let's 
get him,'' pointing at me, before my detail pulled me away to safety.
  Our Capitol was desecrated. Walls were scaled, windows smashed, and 
offices vandalized.
  The mob's goal on January 6 was clear: to overturn the will of the 
American people and block the peaceful transition of power. But, on 
that day, in an act of patriotism that history will forever remember, 
the four leaders decided we would not let Donald Trump and his mob stop 
us from counting the ballots. We came back later that night, finished 
the count, certified the election, and preserved our democracy. And, of 
course, we couldn't have finished our work without the heroics and 
quick thinking of the Capitol Police and MPD officers who defended the 
Capitol on January 6.
  Though vastly outnumbered and underequipped, these public servants 
held the line, saving countless lives and preventing a violent riot 
from becoming something worse. These brave men and women, many of whom 
still bear the scars from the attack on January 6, still come to work 
every day. We say to them now and always: Thank you. Thank God for you. 
We are here for you.
  Three years after the attack, much has changed, but one thing remains 
true: Our democracy, despite those who seek to derail it, marches on. 
Let this anniversary be a reminder that the work to protect democracy 
is never over, that it is a precious gift, and we all must do our part 
to make sure our democracy endures today, tomorrow, and for generations 
to come.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.

From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]



                       Business Before the Senate

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would like to begin by wishing our 
colleagues a very happy new year and welcoming everyone back to begin a 
new session.
  There is a tremendous amount on the Senate's plate, beginning with 
the unfinished business of the year that just ended.
  Yesterday, negotiators announced they had agreed on a path to 
completing full year appropriations for the fiscal year that began 3 
months ago. Delivering on this basic governing responsibility in a 
timely manner has proven a tough row to hoe, and building broad 
recognition of the most urgent priorities facing our Nation remains 
difficult.
  Here is the truth. Threats to U.S. national security are growing, and 
the Biden administration's habit of proposing real-dollar cuts to 
defense funding is a streak that must end at three. With its 
forthcoming budget request for fiscal year 2025, the administration 
needs to finally start taking the long-term needs of America's national 
security seriously.
  But Congress's most immediate opportunity to address urgent national 
security priorities will be supplemental legislation in the coming 
weeks. I was encouraged to see that Senator Lankford and our Democratic 
colleagues made progress toward an agreement to put meaningful border 
security policy at the heart of this supplemental.
  As negotiations continued over the holiday break, Customs and Border 
Protection reported that December set a new, alltime monthly tally for 
southern border apprehensions. The Biden administration's border crisis 
is not going to fix itself, and the status quo is unacceptable. The 
answer, as Republicans have been saying, literally for years, is to 
restore meaningful border enforcement and fix the broken policies that 
the cartels are exploiting to devastating effect. And I am grateful to 
Senator Lankford for continuing to insist on such commonsense steps at 
the negotiating table.
  The stakes here are quite high. We have an opportunity to make the 
most comprehensive headway on border security in a generation.
  But our national security challenges don't end at our own borders. 
The threats we face are intertwined, and the coming days will show the 
world whether America is willing to treat them accordingly. Allies and 
adversaries alike will be curious what we do with news that Russia is 
now attacking targets in Ukraine with ballistic missiles supplied by 
the rogue Kim regime in North Korea, following the suicide drones 
provided by Iran. Yet again, it is abundantly clear that authoritarians 
support authoritarians--as if our clear-eyed Pacific partners like 
Japan, South Korea, and Australia needed more evidence that what 
happens in Ukraine matters in their own neighborhood; as if we needed 
yet another reminder that facing down an expanded industrial base in 
Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea will require America and our 
allies and partners to invest more seriously in our own defense 
production capacity.
  Meanwhile, terrorists in Yemen are spelling out in painful detail 
just how wide the ripples of Iran's war machine extend. The world's 
most active state sponsor of terror isn't just a destabilizing force in 
the Middle East. Tehran isn't just sowing chaos for American-minded 
partners in the region. Tehran's bloody influence isn't even limited to 
helping to train the Hamas and PIJ terrorists who conducted the 
horrific massacre of Israeli Jews on October 7, or to building 
Hezbollah into a top-tier international terrorist organization, or to 
the repeated attacks its proxies have carried out against U.S. 
personnel in Iraq and Syria.
  The Houthis' campaign against civilian ships in the Red Sea is an 
assault on the global economy that the world has no choice but to 
address. Once more, an adversary's initiative has forced a reluctant 
administration to act.
  With fawning conciliation and half measures, the Biden administration 
has squandered deterrence against Iran. Russia is openly mocking the 
fickleness of Western support for Ukraine. And China, our single 
greatest strategic adversary, is watching closely to see if America can 
still manage to lead or sustain credible resistance to authoritarian 
violence.
  So these are the stakes after 3 years of the administration's foreign 
policy. The world is asking not when or how but whether the world's 
greatest superpower will start acting like one, which makes our work on 
the supplemental national security legislation even more urgent. 
Beginning at the southern border, we must demonstrate that America is 
up for the challenges we face. The Senate cannot afford to get this 
wrong.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                              Immigration

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, you know as well as I do what is 
happening in our home State of Illinois when it comes to the migrants 
that are being bussed from Texas, primarily, into our State--the impact 
it has had in the State and in the city of Chicago, in particular. 
These migrants are arriving in the city without any consultation or 
warning and are being dumped in places near the city, totally 
unprepared to face the cruelty of the winter that we are facing in 
Chicago.
  I am amazed at the number of people who have shown extraordinary 
caring and have stepped forward to try to help. I thank Catholic 
Charities, Salvation Army--there are so many groups. There is a New 
Life Center, Matthew DeMateo--extraordinary, just a miracle worker. He 
manages to find a way to put a roof over the heads of those migrants 
that come to our city and give them a fighting chance to have a decent 
life. So many more just like him prepare to step up and provide 
shelter, provide basic clothing, food, accessibility to schools, and 
more.
  I really want to commend the mayor as well. Brandon Johnson has taken 
an approach toward this which I think is humane and consistent with the 
traditions of America. He shows a caring heart time and again, and I 
respect him so much for it.
  Recently, the city of Chicago tried to put some order into this 
disorderly process, identifying times and places where the buses could 
stop so that people could be received properly, cared for, and go about 
their lives as best they could.
  But, unfortunately, there has only been one example of cooperation by 
the State of Texas. There are plenty of examples the other way--people 
who are sent to airports in Rockford where they are dumped out of 
airplanes on the tarmac with no place to turn; people who are put in 
suburban towns and rural areas, which even if they wanted to help, 
would be so limited to what they could do.
  We understand the politics of the situation better than most. We do 
politics for a living. But there are a lot of people who are helpless 
and victims of this situation who need to be taken into consideration.
  The city of Chicago gave the Texas Governor a safe, convenient, 
accessible option to drop the migrants off at a warm shelter for 
orderly processing, but only one bus from Texas has attempted to 
register with the city. The Texas Governor has chosen cruelty and chaos 
over orderly and humane processing.
  I don't understand the politics of that moment. These people are as 
vulnerable as any people on earth. They are doing the best they can for 
themselves, and they are in a situation where they need a helping hand 
in many instances.
  Last week, my colleagues in the Senate were working on a negotiated 
border compromise to deal with the policy and law on the border. I 
support that completely. I don't know what the final product will be, 
and I am hoping to support the bill. This process is long, long 
overdue.
  I made immigration one of the issues of concern for my services. I am 
the

[[Page S8]]

original author of the DREAM Act that was part of the Gang of 8 10 
years ago that passed legislation--bipartisan legislation--on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate. I believe that it is important--it is inevitable--
that we deal with this in a humane and thoughtful way.
  And let me say a word about what is going on at the border. I believe 
in the asylum process. If you are a student of history, you know that 
during World War II, the United States had a policy of turning away 
refugees.
  There is the well-publicized and notorious example of the SS St. 
Louis, a ship which came from Europe and tried to find a port to 
disembark in Havana and in Florida and failed. The passengers were 
returned to Europe--some 700 of them--many of whom died in the 
Holocaust. They were Jewish people looking for a safe place in the 
world where they could live, and we turned them away in World War II. 
That is a fact.
  But at the end of the war, we decided there would be a different 
approach in the future. We would have an orderly international process 
led by the United States when it came to refugees. And we established 
that and lived with it under Presidents of both political parties for 
decades.
  The situation we face at the border today defies what I just 
described to you: the desperate people, in numbers we can handle, 
coming into the United States through an asylum process. What we are 
facing now is just not comparable at all. The thousands and thousands 
of people who are turning up at our borders each day are unsustainable.
  There was a story in the New York Times this morning about the number 
of immigrants who are coming to our southern Mexican border from 
Africa--Africa. And they told a story about a group of people in 
Guinea, Africa, who found a way to travel from Guinea to Turkey, then 
to fly from Turkey to Colombia, then from Colombia to Honduras, and 
then to Nicaragua, where they were transported to the border.
  This defies a stereotype in our mind about where the refugees are 
coming from in Central America. In this last year, more than 10,000 
people from Uzbekistan showed up at our southern border in Mexico. How 
do you explain this?
  Well, one explanation is pretty obvious. We have a refugee crisis in 
this world, the likes of which we have never seen and in numbers from 
all over the world--hundreds of thousands of people who are desperately 
looking. Today, there are over 100 million displaced people worldwide, 
including over 30 million refugees. It is the largest refugee crisis in 
history. That is the starting point of this conversation.
  The second point is equally important. Many of these people have 
found their way to the United States through international groups, some 
of them for very sinister purposes, who are trying to make a lot of 
money on helpless people by promising them they could get into the 
United States and have a much better life. These people are being 
exploited in Africa, in Asia, and around the world, and we have to deal 
with this seriously. They are not the ordinary course of refugees 
coming to the United States. They are overwhelming numbers that have 
completely bankrupted our system in its response.
  I hope this bipartisan group finds a way to deal with it and to 
resolve it in a humane fashion; and I am open to any suggestion. In the 
meantime, I want to commend the people in my State--the mayor and 
others, who are stepping up to do their very best to be humane and 
American in their response. Many of us can trace our own immigrant 
roots back one generation or two. I am certainly one of those. My 
mother was an immigrant to this country. I have met with these 
immigrants from all over the world and all over the United States, and 
I have talked to them. And, although I say to them the situation at our 
border is not sustainable, it has to change, and we can't deal with the 
massive numbers that come our way, I look at each one of them and I see 
in their eyes the eyes of my own family making that decision to come 
here, desperately trying to get to the United States. It is a natural 
human instinct.
  But we need an orderly process. The bill that we passed, the 
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, established such a process. We 
took the 11 million people undocumented in the Nation, and we said to 
them: Step forward, identify yourself, register yourself, pay your 
taxes, and go on working. Realize at a future time, many, many years 
from now, you may be eligible for legal status and even citizenship. 
That was part of the promise. And we need to establish such an approach 
today to find a way to deal with those who are here and those who want 
to stay here and are of no danger to the United States.
  The fact is, we cannot absorb all the people in the world who want to 
come to the United States at this moment. It is just not practical. It 
is not humane even to think in those terms. But those who are here 
should be brought in and assimilated into this country. If they are 
here and are no danger to our country, they can be an important part of 
our future. We need them in so many different ways.
  The Presiding Officer and I know about the agricultural community in 
our own State who have come to us desperate. These are conservative 
individuals politically who see the reality that our workforce is not 
adequate for our economy and the birthrate is not sufficient for us to 
sustain a new population of workers.
  Let's find a thoughtful way to deal with this, stop overwhelming the 
border, and have an orderly process. That can be done, but it has to be 
done on a bipartisan basis.
  Some of the people involved in this process have said publicly they 
don't want to find a solution, that they have too good a political 
issue. I hope that they are wrong. I hope that we can find a solution 
on a bipartisan basis that serves our Nation and that serves the world.
  We need an orderly process. It took 3 to 5 years over in Europe for 
them to come up with their own process. We need to find our own way of 
doing so. I am willing to work with them as chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee and with my background on immigration issues, if there is 
anything I can add to the process.
  I hope that this week, we will receive a report from this bipartisan 
committee that moves us in a direction of an orderly process at our 
border while not being overwhelmed with numbers that are unsustainable.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.

                         Remembering Herb Kohl

  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of 
former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl.
  Herb was a successful businessman, a generous philanthropist, a 
dedicated public servant, and my role model. He was a model boss, 
public servant, and Senator--always putting people first. But, if you 
knew Herb, you knew how humble he was. In fact, after he was first 
sworn in, one of his colleagues whom he respected in this body said to 
him: You are going to be a model Senator. I have heard him tell this 
story a number of times. He decided to look up the definition of 
``model,'' and he quipped back by saying: ``Model, my friends, is a 
small replica of the real thing,'' making light of his rather modest 
stature and deflecting credit for his leadership. That scenario 
embodies a lot of who Herb was. He was modest, funny, and at his core, 
an unrelenting advocate for the people of the State of Wisconsin.
  Senator Kohl served in this body for 24 years, but he served the 
people of Wisconsin and our country throughout his entire life. In the 
Senate, he didn't care how long a fight would take, how long the odds 
were, or who he was up against; if it would help the people of 
Wisconsin, it was worthy of him to engage in that fight. His mantra 
throughout his service was ``Nobody's Senator But Yours,'' and his 
record in Washington reflected that commitment to a tee.
  In Congress, he worked quietly, diligently, and with focus. Herb 
fought to get Wisconsin's dairy farmers fair prices for their products, 
and he worked to invest in and save Wisconsin's family farms. He 
championed vital food assistance programs that children and working 
families rely on and worked to expand access to affordable childcare, 
elder care, and healthcare for millions of Americans. Herb knew that 
taking care of our great outdoors and our environment was key not only 
to our Wisconsin way of life but also to our economy. Working with both 
environmentalists and

[[Page S9]]

business interests, Herb secured resources to clean up drinking water 
sources and combat invasive species and pollution in our Great Lakes. 
He championed initiatives to help workers get the skills they needed to 
be competitive in today's economy and keep Wisconsin's manufacturing 
jobs in Wisconsin.
  Senator Kohl was never afraid to stand up to special interests on 
behalf of his constituents. He diligently led the oversight of mergers 
and acquisitions to protect competition and consumers in everything 
from agriculture to rail, to telecommunications, to healthcare, working 
with Democrats and Republicans to lower the everyday cost of essentials 
like prescription drugs and gasoline.
  At the end of the day, it was always about the people of Wisconsin. 
That is why it should come as no surprise that his office was rightly 
regarded as the best constituent services shop in Congress. As he said 
in his farewell to the Senate in 2012, every Wisconsinite had an ally 
and an advocate in his Senate office. Whether it be getting veterans 
their healthcare benefits, helping a senior navigate Medicare, or 
getting a family their passports in time for a vacation, the Kohl 
office was always there. It is not the stuff that makes headlines, but 
it makes a difference for people, so Herb was invested in it.
  While Senator Kohl actively avoided taking credit for his work, his 
colleagues knew that behind his measured and unassuming demeanor was an 
industrious work ethic, a ready sense of humor, and a fierce commitment 
to doing what was right for Wisconsin. As my predecessor in the Senate, 
I could not have asked for a better role model. Coming into this 
Chamber can be daunting, especially when trying to fill the shoes of 
someone with such a distinguished record and reputation, but luckily 
for me, Senator Kohl's steadfast support and mentorship began well 
before he escorted me into this very Chamber.
  Throughout the years, Senator Kohl had been a constant source of 
wisdom and encouragement. He was generous with his resources, his 
knowledge, his time, and his heart. Any Wisconsinite who had the 
pleasure of meeting Herb knew this overwhelming spirit of generosity 
permeated everything that he did.
  A product of Milwaukee public schools himself, Herb truly believed 
that investing in the next generation of engaged citizens was the 
bedrock of our democracy. Since 1990, his foundation has invested 
millions of dollars in scholarships and fellowships to help Wisconsin's 
students pursue higher education and allow teachers to better meet the 
needs of their classrooms. I know Wisconsin's teachers and students 
will remember Herb as a friend to education.
  Whether you ran into him at a basketball game, at Ma Fischer's in 
Milwaukee, or visited his Washington, DC, office, Herb always had the 
time to say hello and take a picture. No matter his fame or fortune, 
Herb was truly a man of the people.
  Of course, it is hard to talk about Herb Kohl without mentioning his 
beloved Milwaukee Bucks. In fact, it was hard to talk to Senator Kohl 
without talking about the Milwaukee Bucks. As the long-time owner of 
the team, Senator Kohl fought on more than one occasion to keep the 
Bucks in Milwaukee, recognizing the immense value of the franchise to 
the State of Wisconsin and to the city he loved. In large part, because 
of his determination and generosity, Herb was able to watch Milwaukee 
bring home a national championship in 2021 for the first time in 50 
years.

  While Herb is no longer with us, I know his legacy will live on for 
years to come in every young fan who attends a Bucks game and every 
student who jumps around at the Kohl Center while cheering on Badgers 
basketball in Madison. His impact will be felt by the thousands of 
students who will continue to benefit from his philanthropic efforts 
and the Wisconsin families who have food on the table and access to 
affordable healthcare, thanks to his tireless advocacy. I hope his 
legacy of service lives on in me and in all those called to serve the 
communities they love.
  Though Herb Kohl may have had a reputation as a ``common man,'' his 
legacy is anything but ordinary. From humble roots as the son of 
immigrants in Milwaukee, Herb's immense success in business, in public 
life, and philanthropy personified the American dream made reality 
through a Wisconsin work ethic and unwavering commitment to doing right 
by his neighbors.
  There is truly no one like Senator Herb Kohl, and Wisconsin is so 
lucky to have had him fighting in our corner. Herb's record of 
achievement and commitment to Wisconsin is undeniable. While he may not 
like to be called it, it is the truth: Herb was a model Senator, and my 
role model.
  Thank you, Herb, for your service to Wisconsin. You will be dearly, 
dearly missed.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I would like to thank our colleague 
from Wisconsin for her beautiful words, her heartfelt memories.
  And, mostly, I know personally how proud Senator Kohl was that you, 
Senator Baldwin, got elected and serve your State so well. You are 
truly a tribute to your State but also to Herb's memory.
  I am here as the neighbor, the Senator next door, the one who got to 
know Herb Kohl, because Minnesota and Wisconsin, despite our 
rivalries--as the Presiding Officer knows, when it comes to the Vikings 
and the Packers and the Badgers and the Gophers--we actually have a lot 
more in common than what divides us.
  In fact, my mom grew up in Milwaukee. I talked to her many times. She 
also was the daughter of immigrant parents. In her case, her dad worked 
at the Porth Pie Company, which Herb was aware of, and came from humble 
roots.
  Senator Kohl's life was really as American as they come. He was born, 
as we noted, in Milwaukee to immigrant parents. He learned the value of 
hard work, as Senator Baldwin discussed, as a bag boy at his dad's 
market. He attended public high school and the University of Wisconsin 
before earning his MBA. From there, he and his brother worked to build 
their family's business into an iconic department store chain, Kohl's, 
of course. I can't tell you how many times, visiting my grandma in 
Milwaukee, we would be like: We can get that at Kohl's. We can go to 
Kohl's.
  They were so proud of the work that he did.
  Later, when his beloved Milwaukee Bucks almost left Wisconsin, it was 
Herb who bought the team just so he could keep them there. I know that 
Senator Baldwin is proud of the Bucks' 2021 final win, and we all know 
it would never have been the Milwaukee Bucks without Herb Kohl.
  After working his way up from a bag boy to a basketball team owner, 
Herb didn't have to seek public office, but he loved his State and its 
people too much to rest on his laurels. To him, running for office was 
not in any way a path to personal gain. It was a moral obligation.
  After winning election to the Senate in 1988, he got to work right 
away for the people of Wisconsin, and, as Senator Baldwin noted, he 
worked to expand the supply of affordable housing for elderly 
Americans, crack down on corporate espionage, expand safe and 
affordable childcare, and secure critical medical training investments 
in the Affordable Care Act. How proud I know he was of Senator 
Baldwin's--then-Representative Baldwin's--important role in making sure 
that older kids were able to be covered under their parents' policies 
under the Affordable Care Act.
  But he took as much pride in making sure of the big things, as how a 
single dairy farmer could stay afloat in a low-producing season.
  On a personal note, I was lucky to call Herb a mentor and a friend. 
We worked together during my early years in the Senate, including on 
ending 30 years of delay so that the construction of the St. Croix 
River bridge between Minnesota and Wisconsin could move forward. 
Senator Baldwin and I were there for the completion of that historic 
bridge, what we consider one of the most beautiful bridges in our 
State--maybe the most beautiful bridge, but I can never say that. Herb 
was there from the beginning on that project.
  When Herb cared about something, he would work to get it done, and he

[[Page S10]]

would work, as Senator Baldwin has said, in a humble way. He was never 
one to seek the spotlight, and, in a Chamber full of egos and big 
speeches, that certainly made him stand out.
  I remember that even though he was a multimillionaire, he always used 
to eat his lunch in the cafeteria, often buying lunch for staffers that 
he encountered in line.
  One time, he brought me to eat there because I was taking over from 
him as the head of the antitrust subcommittee. He gave me advice from a 
business perspective. People don't always think of antitrust in that 
way, but Herb Kohl was a true entrepreneur. He was a competitor. He 
believed that competition was a big part of capitalism, and that is why 
he cherished his work on that subcommittee and gave me all kinds of 
advice about how to talk about it in a way that, from the very 
beginning of America's roots and our economy, from the Founding Fathers 
on, competition was what made us successful. And he certainly believed 
that when he built that department store chain up and didn't just 
kowtow to whoever was there from the beginning. That really dictated a 
lot about how I thought about antitrust.

  He also told me to hire his staff, like Caroline, and gave me such 
good advice on doing that. I think it was also a great example of Herb 
Kohl because he was looking out for his staff, not just while he was in 
the Senate but long after he left.
  He didn't have to do any of that. There is no rule in the Senate that 
subcommittee chairs have to impart their wisdom at a formal lunch in 
the Senate cafeteria--maybe not that formal--to the next generation, 
and there is no rule that Senators have to keep looking out for their 
staff years and years after they retire. But that is just who Herb was. 
He embodied midwestern compassion--generous with his spirit, generous 
with his time, and generous with his resources.
  He spent his early career working hard to build wealth, and he spent 
the rest of his life using it to make a difference in the world.
  As a product of the public schools, he knew firsthand that a quality 
education was a pathway to success, and that is why he made it his 
mission, later in life, to give back and to invest in public education, 
advocating for breakfast and lunch for low-income students, championing 
Wisconsin's Teacher of the Year Program, and on multiple occasions paid 
for entire slates of teachers' back-to-school supply wish lists, 
something that deeply resonated with me, as my mom would always 
complain about having to buy her own supplies for her classroom as a 
second grade teacher because she wanted them to have the best.
  Today, thanks to his charitable giving, scholarships, and educational 
foundation--and even though from Wisconsin, I must acknowledge--the 
Badgers' hockey and basketball arena bear his name. Herb's philanthropy 
was motivated not by glory but by an unwavering devotion to his State.
  So I will end with this. I think what best captures Herb may have 
been that slogan when he first ran for Senate, and it was this: 
``Nobody's Senator but yours.'' In a field where what is noble is often 
sacrificed for what is expedient, that might seem naive or 
unrealistic--not for Herb. Throughout his 24 years in the Senate, he 
never broke that promise.
  Anyone who has driven from Stillwater, MN, over to the Wisconsin side 
of the St. Croix River, they can thank Herb Kohl. And anyone who went 
to school on a Kohl Student Excellence Scholarship can thank him. And 
anyone who roots for the Milwaukee Bucks, which, once upon a time, 
almost became the Minnesota Bucks--but we are not going to go into that 
story because we have our own team now that is doing pretty well. No, 
this is not the time to do that. We can thank Herb Kohl.
  The Senate is better off, the State of Wisconsin is better off 
because of Herb, and, certainly, our country is better off.
  My thoughts are with his friends, his family, his former staff, and, 
of course, the intrepid and wonderful Senator Baldwin.
  Again, he couldn't be prouder that you got elected, Senator Baldwin.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, Wisconsin has lost a great man. When I 
came to the Senate in 2009, I made an effort to sit down with each 
Member, and, of the 100 Members, the quietest individual, the most 
soft-spoken, was Herb Kohl. He sat behind his desk. We talked about the 
family farms, particularly the dairies of Wisconsin. We talked a little 
bit about basketball--the Oregon Trail Blazers, the Milwaukee Bucks, 
and, of course, the pride that we had when the Blazers won a 
championship back in the 1970s. But, really, it was just a comfortable 
get-to-know-you. Yet I knew the man across the desk from me had been so 
powerfully successful in business and in politics.
  But unlike in virtually any other conversation here in the Senate, he 
didn't lay claim to a single accomplishment or talk about the great 
glories of his career. It was just a ``Welcome to the Senate. Here, you 
can help families out.'' That spirit really fits with what we have 
heard from Senator Baldwin about his legacy--a man who was humble, who 
was generous, who was disciplined, who was hard-working; a man who 
worked not just on agriculture but on housing, but on public education, 
but on cleaning up the Great Lakes, and on many other things that my 
colleagues have mentioned.
  When he was pondering retiring, he talked about the individual that 
he hoped would follow in his footsteps, in his spirit here in the 
Senate--our own Senator Tammy Baldwin. It was almost a family 
connection--a powerful, heart-to-heart connection. So one of the most 
important legacies that he has left is continuing his vision of 
fighting for ordinary families, ordinary people, here in the Senate, 
with the woman who took his place.
  Herb Kohl was modest in style but powerfully effective in practice. 
We miss him here in the Senate, and we know that the people of 
Wisconsin benefited enormously from his life and also miss him greatly 
in his passing.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today with my colleagues to pay 
tribute to a special friend and our former colleague, Senator Kohl of 
Wisconsin.
  I was fortunate enough to be able to serve with Herb Kohl during his 
service in the Senate and have been equally fortunate to know his 
wonderful family.
  I have been listening to my colleagues describe Senator Kohl, and I 
thought that I would describe him in a way that Herb Kohl would never 
describe himself as being. That is because he was too modest.

  The fact is, Herb Kohl was really the embodiment of what we Jews know 
as tikkun olam, which is a belief that all of us have a responsibility 
to leave our world and our communities better off than we found them. 
Herb did that day in and day out, living his life always trying to 
boost the well-being of those less fortunate.
  As my colleagues have been saying, Herb Kohl didn't need to go into 
public service, but what we are all saying today is that public service 
desperately needs people like Herb Kohl: a successful businessperson, 
passionate about improving his home State of Wisconsin and his country 
through public service.
  When most people think of a U.S. Senator, my guess is they have an 
image of somebody who loves to hear themselves talk, puts out a 
blizzard of news releases, tweets every day, and aims to take credit 
for lots of stuff. Herb Kohl was just the opposite of all that.
  For example, at home in Oregon, I always make a point of going to 
Boys & Girls Clubs to shoot baskets with the kids in the summer. Again 
and again, I would encounter young people around lunchtime who came to 
camp ravenous and got two lunches right away. They weren't just hungry; 
they had had nothing to eat but a candy bar since the day before.
  Local Boys & Girls Clubs helped kids get substantial, nourishing 
meals, and they are always trying to find ways to get extra food to 
kids in need, particularly as the week comes to a close and many kids 
are facing a weekend in the summer not knowing where their next meal 
would come from.
  I assume my colleagues know this. It wasn't until years after I had 
been going to shoot hoops in the summer

[[Page S11]]

with the Boys & Girls Clubs--it wasn't until years later that I found 
out that Herb Kohl, our Herb Kohl, was giving generous support to those 
Boys & Girls Clubs for years. But did he say a word about it to my 
colleagues, to me? We talked basketball all the time, but he never 
talked about how he stepped in to help all those future hoopsters. And 
that was Herb Kohl in a nutshell. He would see a need for his 
community, and without any fanfare, without any notice, without any 
press releases, Herb Kohl didn't act like a Senator; he just acted in 
the spirit of tikkun olam. He stepped up. He wanted to help. He never 
asked for an award, never saw himself with a picture of himself in a 
blue suit and a red tie getting some kind of award.
  A number of Senators over the years--and I think this echoes what my 
colleagues have said--they said that Herb was very nice to them and 
very polite. I heard Senator Klobuchar talk about work on antitrust 
stuff. But a lot of colleagues would come up to you and they would say 
our first name and they would say: But I haven't really had a lot of 
extended conversations with Senator Kohl. Now, we know it was not 
because he was unpleasant or wished somebody ill but because he was 
very private, putting in the work each day to make good on his pledges 
to Wisconsin families and so many others.
  All of us read the really wonderful, gracious obituary for Senator 
Kohl in the New York Times. One of the reasons I wanted to come to the 
floor today was to mention a couple of things that they didn't even 
manage to get into that wonderful obituary. It was terrific. But let me 
give some examples.
  My background is working with the Gray Panthers, working with the 
elderly. I was thrilled to be able to work under him when he was chair 
of the Aging Committee. When it came to seniors, no issue for Senator 
Kohl was too small or too insignificant for him to tackle. He tackled 
end-of-life issues and long-term care, addressing unemployment among 
older workers, protecting seniors from financial abuse, tried to help 
them save for retirement. All of us could go through this laundry list 
of accomplishments. Not all of those ideas might have been on the front 
page of the paper, but they represented the quiet and thoughtful 
workhorse that Herb Kohl was.
  Older Americans had no better ally than they did in Senator Kohl. 
Through all the partisan infighting, he always worked on those senior 
issues because he saw that as ground that was exempt from all the 
pettiness that drives so much of politics.
  I will close with this: I was especially appreciative that Senator 
Kohl, in his quiet way, had the vision to look down the road at big 
challenges. For example, he talked to me often--and I am sure my 
colleagues as well--about how the guarantee of Medicare had evolved 
over the years. In other words, Senator Kohl knew that Medicare was not 
a voucher, that it wasn't some piece of paper, some snippet of paper; 
it was a guarantee of Medicare. He also knew that it had evolved over 
the years. It is still continuing with the prescription drug benefit. 
He knew the program inside out, and Senator Kohl would always say to 
me: Let's just keep figuring out how to update the Medicare guarantee, 
protect the elderly, and promote choice and alternatives without 
compromising the protections that older people deserve.
  Let me just say to my colleagues, as chair of the Finance Committee, 
if you walk into the Senate Finance Committee room today and you talk 
about the issues relating to Medicare and Medicare Advantage and them 
spending $6 billion on garbage advertising, Herb Kohl was telling us 
years ago there were supposed to be guardrails for that, there were 
supposed to be protections for that. That was Herb Kohl--thinking down 
the road as well as helping people today.
  So I am really pleased to be here with my good friends, and I will 
just close with one last point. I think one of my colleagues talked 
about it. Senator Klobuchar knew that the Senate was kind of a 
community, and I suspect that there are a few people in the House today 
who understand that as well. But when staff was working late at night--
they might have a bill or an amendment or something or maybe they would 
be working on a project where staff was helping the bigger campus 
community--and it would get to be 8 or 9 o'clock at night and people 
were kind of hoping that somehow, out of the sky, a pizza would 
arrive--not with Herb Kohl. When it got to be 9 o'clock, we got 
ourselves a real dinner, and nobody knew where it came from, but a 
handful of us did.
  Until his last days, Herb Kohl practiced tikkun olam. That is why you 
have some of my most thoughtful colleagues--the Senate is made up of a 
lot of people, but I have just been here a few minutes, and I heard 
Senator Baldwin, Senator Klobuchar, and my partner from Oregon, Senator 
Merkley. These are the kind of people who also represent the best of 
public service. That is why all of us are here--because our hearts are 
heavy today because we so admired him, we so appreciated him.
  I send my love tonight to Sid and Dorothy and Lisa and the whole 
family because they continue to represent the ideals Herb Kohl stood 
for.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.
  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone 
I was honored to work alongside, and I know that many other Members on 
both sides of the aisle feel the same way.
  Herb Kohl wasn't the most outgoing Senator. Some people might have 
called him quiet or even shy. But he was never quiet about fighting for 
the people of Wisconsin. And he was never shy about standing up for the 
things he believed in. He was absolutely passionate about protecting 
our Great Lakes, our land, and the people in Wisconsin and across the 
country who depend on them for their livelihoods. Wisconsin's dairy 
farmers and rural communities had no greater champion, and they are so 
fortunate that Senator Baldwin has carried on Senator Kohl's good work.
  He was also a champion for American families and for ensuring that 
they have access to fresh, healthy food. As chairman of the Agriculture 
Appropriations panel, he fought to expand nutrition programs for 
children and to fund the WIC Program, which helps make sure American 
moms and babies have the food they need to thrive. And as chairman of 
the Special Committee on Aging, he was laser-focused on the needs of 
older Americans, including through improving the quality and safety of 
nursing homes.
  Of course, we all know what a huge sports fan he was as the longtime 
owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and a member of the team that brought the 
Brewers to Wisconsin. It was wonderful that he was able to watch his 
beloved Bucks win the NBA title in 2021, and he even rode in the 
championship parade.
  Perhaps he will be most remembered for his generosity. His Herb Kohl 
Educational Foundation has provided more than $34 million to support 
Wisconsin schools, teachers, and students since 1990. And he made a 
lasting impact at his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
where the Kohl Center Arena and the Herb Kohl Public Service Research 
Competition still carry his name.
  But beyond the sports teams and beyond his legislative legacy, 
Senator Kohl was kind. He was humble. He believed in treating everyone 
with respect. He knew how fortunate he was, and he spent his life 
ensuring that as many other people as possible could share in his good 
fortune. I firmly believe that the Senate--and our country--would be a 
kinder, better place if more of us would follow his lead. Senator Kohl 
was a statesman, and he was my friend. I am grateful for the time we 
worked together in the Senate.
  I want to offer his family, friends, and the entire State of 
Wisconsin my deepest condolences.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.

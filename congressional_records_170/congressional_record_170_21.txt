             RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF MR. PORTER FRIERSON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDREW OGLES

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize Mr. 
Porter Frierson, who served in the 42nd Regiment of the Union Army 
during the Civil War.
  A native Tennessean, Mr. Frierson was born in 1849 in Macadonia. 
Joining the Union Army at a young age, Mr. Frierson served as a drummer 
in Company A of the 42nd. Formed in both Chattanooga and Nashville, the 
42nd performed valuable service as a garrison regiment; providing for 
the protection of territory held by the Union Army before being 
disbanded in 1866. Mr. Frierson is buried today in Rose Hill Cemetery 
in Humboldt, Tennessee.
  The son of an enslaved woman with two brothers and a sister, Mr. 
Frierson would go on to raise a family of his own after serving his 
Nation. He is remembered today by his descendants, who are rightly 
proud of his service. I invite all my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the memory of this great American hero.

                          ____________________

                   RECOGNIZING OFFICER CAMERON FLINN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. SCOTT PERRY

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Officer Cameron 
Flinn on earning the status of the 2023 Springettsbury Township 
``Officer of the Year.''
  Officer Flinn began his service with the Department in February 2022. 
After several years' experience in two other agencies, their loss 
clearly was Springettsbury's gain. In his short time serving 
Springettsbury thus far, Officer Flinn is a Department leader in calls 
handled, criminal investigations, and traffic enforcement. In 2023 
alone, he handled 587 incidents, had 277 traffic contacts, investigated 
58 motor vehicle crashes, and executed 136 criminal arrests. He 
frequently welcomes new challenges, and assumes as much responsibility 
as possible to serve our community--all while soliciting additional 
training that resulted in his recent selection as a member of the York 
County Forensics Team.
  In one of many notable incidents, Officer Flinn was dispatched to 
Hollywood Casino at the York Galleria Mall for a subject in cardiac 
arrest. While attending to the individual, responding officers were 
alerted to a second individual also in cardiac arrest on the casino 
floor. Officer Flinn administered lifesaving Naxalone and CPR to both 
individuals, who regained consciousness and were up and talking within 
a half hour.
  While maintaining his high productivity and professional standards of 
conduct, Officer Flinn also excels in the area of community engagement. 
The Department receives myriad Citizen calls commending him and his 
performance of duty(ies), as well as testifying to his friendly 
interactions with them. He's also earned various praise from numerous 
colleagues for his outstanding work. During the holiday season, Officer 
Flinn took the initiative outside of his official duties to organize a 
``Shop With a Cop'' event at a local store; he took note of the 
families that received gifts at the event, and then raised additional 
funds to purchase gifts for those children. His impact on the community 
both in and out of official duty status is exceptional.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm truly grateful, privileged, and honored to recognize 
and commend Officer Cameron Flinn for earning the Springettsbury 
Township Police Department 2023 ``Officer of the Year'' award. His 
tireless, loyal, and dedicated service is the standard by which all 
others should be judged.

                RECOGNIZING HELEN BUYCE'S 104TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Helen Buyce, 
a remarkable constituent from my district celebrating her 104th 
birthday. Helen was born February 2, 1920, in Wells, New York, but now 
resides in Newtown, Pennsylvania to be closer to family.
  Helen Dampier graduated from Wells Central School in 1938. She first 
started working as a housekeeper and then moved on to a job at General 
Electric during World War II working alongside Rosie the Riveter. 
During this time, she began to date Roy Buyce, who joined the United 
States Army while Helen waited patiently for her true love to return. 
On February 26, 1946, they finally were married and made their home in 
Wells, New York, where she lived until moving to Bucks County. While 
living in Wells, Helen worked for the United States Postal Service.
  Helen and Roy spent many of their winters in Florida. She and Roy had 
their own vegetable garden, and she was well known for the pickles she 
made. Helen lost Roy in 1998 but stayed in Wells until she was 99. She 
kept active in the Wells community and enjoyed baking and cooking, 
especially for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She spent her 
time relaxing by reading her favorite novels. Helen's nightly ritual 
included watching Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, reading the newspaper, 
and doing crossword puzzles.
  Since Helen first arrived at Buckingham Valley Rehabilitation Center, 
she has never missed a BINGO game. She loves getting her hair done 
weekly and never misses an appointment. She comes to all entertainment 
and makes sure to sit upfront. Helen relishes conversation with staff 
and always leaves you smiling.
  Helen could not be prouder of her growing family in Bucks County, PA. 
Joan, her only child and her son-in-law, Jim, live in Yardley, PA. Her 
two granddaughters, Jenny, and Katie, having families of their own, 
live only short distances away. Helen is well known to be a wonderful 
mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, and aunt. She is 
affectionately known as ``Granny'' to 5 great-grandchildren.
  To Helen, family is everything. Her daughter Joan calls her every 
evening and comes to see her regularly. On special occasions, Joan will 
help her FaceTime other members of the family so she can enjoy and 
participate in life celebrations.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to please join me in extending our heartfelt 
congratulations, sincere well-wishes, and all of God's Blessings to 
Helen Buyce on the celebration of her 104th Birthday.

                          ____________________

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dorothy 
Yelenchic, an amazing constituent from my district about to celebrate 
her 101st birthday. Dorothy was born in Broughton, Pennsylvania on 
February 7, 1923. Dorothy had three brothers and one sister.
  Dorothy attended school in Pennsylvania and worked at a drugstore 
afterwards. Following this, Dorothy worked in a bakery, which she 
loved, and still enjoys a sweet treat every now and then.
  Dorothy met and married her husband, Stephen, in 1947 after the pair 
met at a dance. Together, they moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania for 
Stephen's job at United States Steel Corporation and were among 
Levittown's original homeowners.
  They raised three children, Gary, David, and Carole in the Blue Ridge 
Section. Dorothy was a homemaker and enjoyed spending time with her 
family at Penn Warner Club, as well as shopping in Levittown Shopping 
Center with

[[Page E116]]

her daughter and son. Dorothy was an excellent homemaker and an 
especially good cook, known for her soup.
  Dorothy now has one grandchild, Candice, and three great-
grandchildren, Valerie, Hannah and Dylan. Dorothy loves music, having 
engaging conversations, and is always happy with a good cup of coffee. 
To this day, Dorothy still loves polka music.
  As we celebrate her 101 years of life, we are incredibly grateful for 
the positive impact she has made on all who know her.

                       TRIBUTE TO TARA VANDERVEER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and praise an 
extraordinary American, Stanford Women's Basketball Coach, aka `T 
Dawg', Tara VanDerveer. On January 21, 2024, she won her 1,203rd game, 
setting an all-time record for the most coaching wins in the history of 
college basketball. She achieved this in 45 seasons and has led her 
team to three N.C.A.A. champIonship victories.
  Tara VanDerveer is the daughter of Dunbar and Rita VanDerveer and was 
born in Boston in 1953. She didn't play basketball at her first high 
school, but she played when she transferred to Buffalo Seminary in her 
junior year. She attended Albany University where she played as a 
freshman, then transferred to Indiana University, Bloomington where her 
team reached the AIAW Final Four.
  After college, Tara took an unpaid assistant coaching position at 
Ohio State where she quickly ascended to Assistant Coach and Head JV 
Coach. She then became Head Coach at the University of Idaho. She 
returned to Ohio State as Head Coach for the 1980-1981 season and left 
to become Stanford's Head Coach in 1985. Her record at Stanford was 27-
5 by her third year, and her team earned a bid to the N.C.A.A. 
tournament in 1988 and has done so every year since. In 1989 Stanford 
won the Pac-10 regular season and in 1990 reached the Final Four. Tara 
took a one-year leave from Stanford to coach the U.S. Olympic team, 
winning the Gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
  Tara is loved by her players and is known for her fairness and her 
moderate temperament. Her rules for leadership success include having a 
vision for her team, maximizing each player's strengths, and minimizing 
their weaknesses. She wants her players and staff to complement her, 
not compliment her, and she always remembers her father's advice that 
you `can't win the Kentucky Derby on a donkey.' She is a good listener 
and a constant learner who credits her parents for teaching her the 
most about leadership.
  Tara VanDerveer and the Stanford Women's Basketball team have brought 
entertainment and joy to legions of fans. Home game nights are 
sacrosanct for the team's devotees. They won't miss a game for 
anything. The fans know how much Tara deserves the almost fifty Coach 
of the Year awards she has earned.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring Stanford Women's Basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer. I'm 
exceedingly proud to represent her and her teams in the Congress and 
know that all my constituents join me in a huge college cheer for this 
amazing champion. She is widely and affectionately known by her well-
earned sobriquet, G.O.A.T. Tara VanDerveer is indeed the Greatest Of 
All Time. She is a national treasure and a jewel in the crown of the 
16th Congressional District.

                 PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM DUIs ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. ZOE LOFGREN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, February 1, 2024

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, the deceptively titled ``Protect 
Communities from DUIs Act'' uses a catchy name to mask the true intent 
of the bill. This flaw led me and others who care deeply about public 
safety and the threat of drunk drivers to oppose. There are already 
existing laws that make someone deportable if they are convicted of a 
``crime involving moral turpitude,'' where the crime--including a 
serious DUI--is punishable by imprisonment of one year or more.
  H.R. 6976 would expand current law for individuals who have been 
convicted of a single misdemeanor. This could include a legal resident 
who is 50 years old who had a single offense at age 18. Disrupting 
families and communities in such a case doesn't make sense and public 
safety would not be served.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Hindu Community in 
Arizona's 8th Congressional District, I would like to recognize the 
successful completion of Sewa Diwali in the Salt River Valley, led by 
Vaibhav Navghare and the dedicated members of the non-profit Hindu 
Swayamsevak Sangh. This excellent organization was founded by Kenyan 
Hindus in the 1940s and is active in 156 countries. They are 
responsible for putting together Sewa Diwali each year, which is a 
large food drive to celebrate the spirit of selfless giving during the 
festival of Diwali. Under Mr. Navghare's leadership, 9,300 pounds of 
food were collected by over 110 volunteers from 40 different 
organizations in the Salt River Valley. All of the proceeds directly 
benefitted the Navajo tribes at Flagstaff.
  I am incredibly proud of the hard work that Mr. Navghare and Hindu 
Swayamsevak Sangh put into helping those in need and I thank them for 
their service. May their charitable endeavors inspire others to give 
back as well; they exemplify the best of Arizona.

                 CELEBRATING AVANCE'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
congratulate AVANCE for their 50 years of service uplifting Latino 
families to their fullest potential. San Antonio is proud to be home to 
the headquarters of this leading nonprofit, which is dedicated to 
improving the lives of Latino communities through high quality and 
culturally responsible early childhood and parenting education.
  In 1973, San Antonio native Dr. Gloria Rodriguez saw a need to 
address growing systemic racial inequalities in education on our city's 
Westside. Fifty years later, what started out as a program serving 35 
San Antonio families at one housing development project has grown into 
a national-scale operation. AVANCE now serves more than 13,000 
caregivers and children every year throughout Texas and California.
  AVANCE believes that parents are their child's first teacher and that 
home is a child's first classroom, and that thinking guides their core 
Parent-Child Education Program. They work tirelessly to foster economic 
mobility for Latino families by opening the door to opportunity for 
both caregivers and children.
  Over the years, hundreds of thousands of families have been impacted 
by AVANCE's work. By 2030, Latinos will make up nearly 30 percent of 
the American student population.

[[Page E117]]

Our nation's prosperity goes hand in hand with the success of these 
students, and organizations like AVANCE that are ensuring that the next 
generation of American leaders have a strong foundation. I look forward 
to many more years of powerful work from AVANCE and endless 
possibilities for Latino families to come.

        TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WORKERS ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 31, 2024

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, do you all remember when our 
good friend, Mitt Romney, talked about the 47 percent of the takers?
  This bill locks in the principle that we have takers and makers. We 
have $600 billion of tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations that may 
become permanent, and yet some woman who gets up in a rural area and 
marches off to the grocery store and works 30 hours a week still won't 
be able to get the full refundable child tax credit because she is too 
poor. She is a taker; she is not a maker.
  This is a compromise bill. It is better than current law where that 
same minimum wage worker would have to work 70 hours a week in order to 
get this tax credit now only has to work 40 hours a week, plus do a 
little Uber on the side to get the tax credit.
  So I think we need to compromise, but we don't need to capitulate. 
And I represent the 47 percent of those deemed takers. We are going to 
expand this tax credit for poor children, but the poorest will be even 
poorer.

 COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EL PASO COUNTY SENIOR MEAL 
                                PROGRAM

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary 
of the El Paso County Senior Meal Program.
  Since February 1974, El Paso has been assisting seniors across our 
community to receive at least one warm meal a day through the Older 
Americans Act. The program first started at the Sacred Heart Church 
Center and St. Alban's Church Center and there are now over 16 centers 
across El Paso. The El Paso County Senior Meal Program ensures that no 
senior goes hungry.
  Today, in partnership with various regional government entities such 
as the City of El Paso, City of Socorro, City of San Elizario, Town of 
Clint, as well as grant funders including the Rio Grande Area Agency on 
Aging and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, El Paso 
County remains committed to delivering essential services, including 
providing nutritious meals, facilitating socialization, conducting 
wellness activities, and performing safety checks. These services are 
consistently offered across 16 congregate sites, where a dedicated team 
of both staff and volunteers works collaboratively to serve 
approximately 12,057 congregate meals each month. Additionally, an 
impressive 39,000 home-delivered meals are distributed monthly as part 
of this initiative.
  Today, it is my privilege to recognize the significant contributions 
of the El Paso County Community Services Department personnel, as well 
as their partners and the multitude of volunteers involved in 
delivering these essential and crucial services to our community, for 
the last 50 years. I wish them continued success and impact for many 
years to come.

                               speech of

                           HON. HAROLD ROGERS

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, January 31, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I share my colleagues' support 
of H.R. 7024, the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act. 
This bill is pro-growth, pro-small business, pro-family, and will truly 
help our people in southern and eastern Kentucky.
  I want to first point out that this bill will help folks in my 
district who are still recovering from the devastating flooding that we 
endured in 2021 and 2022. The recovery process has been long and 
difficult, and this bill takes important steps to make it easier for 
flood survivors to deduct their losses by eliminating minimum loss 
requirements and not penalizing individuals for compensation they 
received. Our people need all the help they can get, and this bill will 
help us move forward and build back stronger than ever.
  This bill will also help our families struggling with the lingering 
impact of inflated high prices by expanding access to the child tax 
credit, eliminating the penalty for larger families, and ensuring that 
the tax credit is adjusted for inflation, so this benefit isn't reduced 
over time. This will truly make a difference for the people of 
Kentucky's rural Appalachian region.
  This tax relief bill will also boost our economy, jumpstart 
innovation by allowing businesses to deduct research and development 
costs immediately, which will enable us to always be at the forefront 
of the world economy. It will also help small businesses by 
incentivizing capital investments, enabling them to boost their growth 
and increase productivity. Finally, this bill eliminates wasteful COVID 
era spending by accelerating the deadline for backdated claims under 
the employee retention credit.
  This credit system has experienced rampant fraud and abuse, and its 
elimination will save hardworking Americans taxpayer dollars.
  I am proud to support this legislation, and urge the Senate to 
consider it quickly to provide much-needed tax relief in southern and 
eastern Kentucky and across our great Nation.

                          ____________________

                RECOGNIZING MR. QUENTIN ROMAN STAMBAUGH

                                 ______

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Mr. Quentin Roman 
Stambaugh on the auspicious occasion of his 100th Birthday on February 
8, 2024.
  Mr. Stambaugh dedicated much of his impressive 100 years to the 
honorable service of our Nation. He first reported for duty on 6 April 
1943, to then-Camp George G. Meade, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army 
Air Corps, and then completed Basic Training in Miami Florida. He was 
assigned to the U.S. Army Technical School in Sioux Falls SD, where he 
trained to become a Radioman and Mechanic. He progressed to Yuma, AZ as 
a Gunnery School trainee, and learned to operate the B-25/Mitchell 
Aircraft. After vigorous training, he was deployed to the Southwest 
Pacific region at the height of WWII, serving as a Radioman and Tail 
Gunner, and making his mark on our Nation as part of ``The Greatest 
Generation.''
  Mr. Stambaugh heroically flew 38 Combat Missions, during which he had 
four take downs against the Japanese enemy, and numerous enemy 
installations. He earned the Expert Marksman badge, the Presidential 
Unit Citation, and a personal letter to his parents from General George 
Kenney, Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. In the 
letter, General Kenney cited Mr. Stambaugh's ``Meritorious Achievement 
while participating in aerial flights in the Southwest Pacific area 
from February 25, 1945 to March 30, 1945 . . .'' and noted his service 
as ``. . . a real and very tangible contribution to victory and 
peace.'' General Kenney further stated that ``I would like to tell you 
how genuinely proud I am to have men such as your son in my command, 
and how gratified I am to know that young Americans with such courage 
and resourcefulness are fighting our Country's battle against the 
aggressor nations. You have every reason to share that pride and 
gratification.'' Mr. Stambaugh, having brushed with death numerous 
times, never forgets his Brothers-in-Arms who made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our Nation, fellow Warriors, and our way of life.
  Returning home after earning an Honorable Discharge on 18 December 
1945, Mr. Stambaugh transitioned to civilian life at PH Gladfelter in 
Spring Grove, and earned a Magistrate position in York County--further 
serving our Nation in a judicial capacity for four consecutive six-year 
terms. Mr. Stambaugh and his wife, Bertha, had three children, and he 
still lives in the home he and Bertha built together near his childhood 
home in Spring Grove.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm honored, privileged, and humbled to celebrate Mr. 
Quentin Roman Stambaugh on the blessed occasion of his 100th Birthday. 
His tireless, selfless, and dedicated service of our communities, 
Commonwealth, and Nation sets the standard by which we should all be 
judged. I wish him continued Godspeed.

       SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO SECURE OUR NATION'S SOUTHERN BORDER

                           HON. HAROLD ROGERS

                              of kentucky

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I share my colleagues' support 
for H.R. 5585,

[[Page E118]]

the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, H.R. 6678, the Consequences 
for Social Security Fraud Act, H.R. 6679, the No Immigration Benefits 
for Hamas Terrorists Act, and H.R. 6976, the Protect Our Communities 
from DUIs Act.
  Our Nation is amid unprecedented chaos at our southern border. Every 
day, thousands of illegal aliens are flooding over the border and into 
our cities, increasing crime at alarming rates. The rise of unabated 
human trafficking at our southern border should be among our greatest 
motivations for meaningful action. While some illegal aliens are 
fleeing oppression and poor economic conditions in their countries, 
many of them are trafficking large quantities of drugs, weapons, and 
other contraband. At a time when Americans are dying from fentanyl and 
other drug overdoses at catastrophic rates, we must do everything in 
our power to slow the stem of trafficking. Moreover, with surges in 
violent crime across our country, we need to ensure that our federal 
immigration authorities have the resources necessary to remove illegal 
aliens who commit crimes against innocent Americans.
  Each of these bills aim to empower federal authorities to reject or 
remove illegal immigrants who commit certain crimes. This includes 
aliens who intentionally evade border patrol agents or law enforcement 
assisting those agents; aliens who commit social security fraud; aliens 
who are convicted of driving under the influence; and aliens who are 
members of the Hamas terrorist group or involved in the October 7, 2023 
attack on Israel.
  We must take action to make the United States safer, and I am proud 
to support these efforts to do exactly that.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS AND AMERICAN SAMOA COLLEGE 
                               ACCESS ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                    of the northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Northern Mariana 
Islands and American Samoa College Access Act, which would authorize 
tuition assistance grants to cover the difference between in-state and 
out-of-state tuition costs for Marianas and American Samoa community 
college graduates seeking to attend a four-year public university.
  The importance of having an educated citizenry is a bedrock principle 
of our nation and has been since our founding. And in today's 
competitive job market, a postsecondary education is increasingly 
becoming a critical necessity for obtaining a decent job with a decent 
wage.
  The Northern Mariana Islands has only been part of America for forty-
five years. We understand well that education is key to our continued 
growth, but the reality is that household incomes in the Marianas are 
less than half the national median. The U.S. territory of American 
Samoa is in similar economic straits. Poverty and unemployment rates 
there are among the highest in the country.
  I believe the best way to improve economic conditions in these 
territories is to improve the educational opportunities available to 
our residents. Unfortunately, however, neither the Marianas nor 
American Samoa have a four-year institution of higher education. In 
fact, they are the only U.S. states or territories in the country 
without a public four-year college or university. Each has an 
accredited community college, but academic offerings are substantially 
limited.
  Students from these U.S. territories wanting the advantages of a 
four-year university in another state or territory face significant 
financial difficulty. Nonresident students spend an average of $16,380 
in out-of-state tuition and fees more per year than their resident 
peers at public four-year colleges, according to College Board. That 
$16,380 differential puts a four-year college degree out of reach for 
many students from our islands where the median household income is 
$30,000. And many students in the Marianas and American Samoa wanting 
to attend a four-year university not only face the cost of out-of-state 
tuition, but also the significant expense of travel. The Marianas is 
over 3,700 miles from the nearest state, Hawaii--a $1,100 one-way trip 
by plane. American Samoa to Hawaii is over 2,500 miles, which is over 
$800 one-way.
  The bill follows the model of P.L. 106-98, the D.C. College Access 
Act, which allows students residing in the District of Columbia to 
apply for grants to help pay the cost of attending colleges outside 
D.C., but much smaller in scope and cost. My legislation creates a 
program through which public four-year schools in the 50 states, D.C., 
and other U.S. territories may be reimbursed for offering in-state 
tuition to undergraduate students from the Marianas and American Samoa.
  The gentlewoman from American Samoa, Mrs. Radewagen, is an original 
cosponsor of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan 
legislation and help give students from the Marianas and American Samoa 
the means needed to make their educational dreams a reality.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
incredible accomplishments of Dr. Cleophus A. Robinson of the 
Willingboro Fort Dix/McGuire Air Force Base Alumni Chapter of Kappa 
Alpha Psi, Inc.
  Serving as a Tuskegee Airman in the United States Air Force during 
World War II, Dr. Robinson dedicated almost 40 years of his life to 
serving our country. It was in the Air Force when he joined the Kappa 
Alpha Psi Fraternity, of which he has been a member for 74 years. In 
1975, Dr. Robinson became a Grand Chapter Life Member of the fraternity 
and went on to become a founding member of the Willingboro Fort Dix/
McGuire Air Force Base Alumni Chapter which aims to inspire interest in 
public service. Dr. Robinson's dedication to the Kappa Alpha Psi 
Fraternity and service has had ripple effects across our communities in 
Burlington County, New Jersey, and across the Garden State.
  Not only has Dr. Robinson dedicated his life to serving his community 
and bettering the lives of those around him, he also received his 
Masters of Public Administration from the City University of New York, 
and later went on to earn his Doctorates in Education from Rutgers 
University.
  The scope of Dr. Robinson's work has touched innumerable lives. He 
was one of the founding members of the Southern Burlington County 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and 
served 15 years as a member of the Executive Committee of the New 
Jersey State Conference of NAACP. Through his work with this 
organization, Dr. Robinson uplifted the voices of his community and 
empowered underrepresented families across the state to stand up for 
what is right and just.
  Dr. Robinson not only excelled at serving his country and community, 
but he is a family man, married to his wife, Leonia McCelland, for over 
60 years with three adult children.
  While many community members locally know Dr. Cleophus Robinson and 
his positive impact in our community, today I'm proud to honor his 
tenure as a public servant and veteran of the United States Air Force. 
We are lucky to have his inspiration in our community.

                          HONORING PAUL DILLON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
career and accomplishments of one of southeastern Connecticut's most 
prominent veterans' advocates, Mr. Paul Dillon. Paul has dedicated his 
retirement from his service in the U.S. Navy to being a staunch 
defender of veterans both within his hometown of Gales Ferry, 
Connecticut, and around the southeast region.
  Paul served in the Navy for nearly a quarter century from 1956 to 
1980 and was an exemplary sailor. His service encompassed the Vietnam 
War and his tenure saw him promoted to U.S. Navy Master Chief. After 
service, he became a member of my Veterans Advisory Council, the 
president of the Nautilus Chapter of the Association of the U.S. Navy, 
and more. In 2012, he was befittingly inducted into the CT Veterans' 
Hall of Fame. The efforts he has made to protect and serve his country 
reflect his generosity and patriotism. His selfless commitment to his 
community and to veterans from across the country has undoubtedly 
inspired future generations.
  Paul Dillon courageously and honorably served in the Navy during the 
Vietnam War, putting his life on the line to defend our nation. He was 
a Master Chief Radio Man on the USS Oklahoma City and USS Providence 
for three years. Paul rose to the challenge of working over 18 hour 
days, surrounded by constant fire. The stressful conditions of war were 
no match for Paul's tenacious spirit. He continued to work tirelessly 
to protect our country. His presence was integral to the protection and 
preservation of democracy and every American's liberty.
  Unfortunately, Paul was exposed to Agent Orange during his tours and 
to this day he suffers from the health complications caused from the 
chemical exposure. After his years of active-duty service ended, he 
quickly focused

[[Page E119]]

on advocating for veterans, especially for Blue Water Navy veterans 
like him who suffered from similar service-connected health 
complications. Shockingly, the U.S. Veterans Administration in the 
early 2000's refused to grant ``presumptive eligibility'' for agent 
orange exposure health illness for veterans of AMERICA'S sea services. 
The VA's ``foot on the ground'' rule granted such coverage for Army and 
Marine Corps ground troops creating an outrageous disparity and 
discrimination against Navy and Coast Guard veterans of the Vietnam 
War. It took 17 years of constant advocacy to finally get Congress to 
pass a new law correcting this injustice. Paul's personal experience 
with the lasting impact of exposure served to enhance his advocacy 
ability, giving him a unique understanding of the hardship endured by 
many Vietnam era veterans. It was an honor for me as his congressman to 
help achieve this hard-fought legislative victory as an original 
cosponsor of this measure.
  When he was appointed as the Northeast Regional Vice President of the 
National Association for Uniformed Services (NAUS), he worked on behalf 
of other veterans to protect and enhance their earned benefits.
  After his retirement from the Navy, Paul joined Sonalyst Inc. By 
1983, he started at Northeast Utilities as a telecommunication manager 
at Millstone Nuclear Power Station, retiring from his second career in 
1997. One year after his second retirement, Paul started at the Retired 
Activities Office (RAO) at NSB New London where he remains today.
  Paul's sense of modesty and obligation to the Connecticut veteran 
community has been evidenced through his numerous volunteer 
commitments. In addition to his work at the RAO, he participates in 
events to honor the veterans of the district, such as when he lays 
wreaths on graves of veterans at the Jordan Cemetery in Waterford as 
part of Wreaths Across America. Moreover, he served the Co-Chairman of 
Kaps for Kids in Groton. With Kaps for Kids, he visits sick children, 
brightening their days, at a local hospital each Veteran's Day. His 
attentiveness to those experiencing adversity is heartening and 
inspiring.
  I am honored and privileged to know Paul Dillon on a personal level. 
Paul has been an irreplaceable asset as a member of my Veterans 
Advisory Council. His wisdom surrounding veterans issues is extremely 
useful, it is a pleasure to receive his guidance. He is a dear friend 
of my office and frequently assists on myriad issues relating to 
veteran affairs.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize and immortalize the 
continued works of Paul Dillon. In addition to his distinguished 
service career, he has been a mainstay of the veteran community within 
my district. It is no small consolation to know that model citizens 
like Paul continue to inspire future generations. I ask my colleagues 
in the House to join me in commending and thanking Paul Dillon for his 
endless service to the public.

                          ____________________

             RECOGNIZING MARIAN MacFARLAND'S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marian 
MacFarland, a remarkable constituent from my district who is about to 
celebrate her 100th birthday. Marian was born on February 13, 1924, in 
Eldred, Pennsylvania, moved to Feasterville, and now resides in 
Newtown, Bucks County.
  Marian Edgar graduated from Eldred High School, in Eldred, PA. She 
moved to Philadelphia, PA working at a Munitions Plant where she met 
John Russell MacFarland. Russ worked at the Naval Yard as the Chief 
Petty Officer in charge of repairs and re-outfitting the Naval ships. 
Marian and Russ were married on January 17, 1948, after he came home 
from World War II.
  Marian and Russ moved to the suburbs in 1952, building their dream 
home together in Feasterville, PA. Marian worked for Strawbridge's 
department store in Philadelphia before starting a family. She and Russ 
are blessed with two sons, John and David, and one daughter, Jean 
Marie. She also has six grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren. 
She is immensely proud of the many family ``get togethers'' at her home 
where the main course was always chips and dip served with tuna 
hoagies.
  Marian made her move to Buckingham Valley Rehabilitation Center with 
ease, making new friends as she shared her joys of life. She still 
enjoys gardening, working in the yard, trimming her plants, and 
attending to her flowers daily. Marian loves dancing, and she insists 
that it is what kept her in such great shape all these years. She loves 
her pet therapy visits and a nighttime snack with her roommate. 
Everyone who knows Marian would agree that her sweet tooth is her top 
priority.
  Marian has an enthusiastic sense of humor and imagination. She loves 
to reminisce with her daughter Jean and son-in law, Bill about life's 
great memories, while her son David always comes for nightly visits. 
Marian has created lasting memories that affect every person she has 
encountered thus far in her life, and it is my fervent hope that she 
continues her positive impact on our community, district, and country.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to please join me in extending our heartfelt 
congratulations, sincere well-wishes, and all of God's Blessings to 
Marian MacFarland on the celebration of her 100th Birthday.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of Mrs. Tonya Latrice Finley-McCaw. Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a 
remarkable servant leader who touched the lives of so many people 
across the St. Louis community.
  A passionate advocate, Mrs. Finley-McCaw fought tirelessly for the 
rights of families and workers, including aiding efforts across the 
region and state for living wages and the right to unionize. Together, 
alongside her inspiring son and a stalwart community leader, Rasheen, 
the pair were never far from a picket line, joining striking workers 
and allies demanding fair wages in the ``Fight for $15'' movement.
  Mrs. Finley-McCaw was indefatigable. In addition to her strong 
support of labor rights and economic justice, she also chaired St. 
Louis City's Moms Demand Action chapter in an effort to tackle the 
crisis of gun violence in our communities and received several 
leadership certificates and accolades for her wide-ranging work and 
advocacy throughout the St. Louis region.
  Born on July 7, 1970, in Chicago, Illinois, to her loving parents, 
Samuel and Dorothy Finley. She was also blessed with an amazing sister, 
Teijuania Finley. Finley-McCaw attended and graduated from Parkway 
South High School, where she was crowned prom queen. She later pursued 
higher education at St. Louis College of Health Careers and obtained 
her certification as a phlebotomist.
  Mrs. Finley-McCaw was married to the love of her life, Rick McCaw, 
for 27 years. She is the proud mother of three sons: Rashaad Crawford, 
Rasheen Aldridge, and Rasheed Finley. She is the stepmother to Rickey 
McCaw, Rikeyia McCaw, Malik McCaw, and Bernard Wings. When she wasn't 
spending time with her family or working to improve the lives of her 
St. Louis neighbors, Mrs. Finley-McCaw loved to cook (especially on 
holidays), play with her dogs, travel, and spend time with her 
grandchildren.
  Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a great friend and mother figure to many. I 
have fond memories of her. I have fond memories of her helping to 
support me as I worked hard to represent the people of Missouri's First 
District. She provided unparalleled guidance and never faltered in the 
work of ensuring St. Louis has the representation it deserves at every 
level of government, I got to witness what a remarkable human she was 
to those around and what an incredible mother she was through my 
personal friendship with Rasheen. She touched so many of our hearts and 
she will be deeply missed. May her memory forever be a blessing.

  HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF BELLE ORTIZ, THE MOTHER OF MARIACHI

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GREG CASAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. CASAR. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to call the attention of the 
House in recognition of the life and legacy of Belle Ortiz, a legendary 
San Antonian and the Mother of Mariachi.
  Born on February 12, 1933, Isabel ``Belle'' A. Ortiz grew up on the 
west side of San Antonio, TX. She began her musical journey at the age 
of four, and as a youth, Ms. Ortiz performed across the city with 
various orchestras. After graduating from Our Lady of the Lake 
University, she began her career as a public school music teacher, 
eventually landing at Lanier High School, her alma mater, in 1970.
  At a time when speaking another language besides English was frowned 
upon, Ms. Ortiz was committed to teaching music that reflected the rich 
cultural diversity of Texas. At Lanier High School in San Antonio, she 
created the high school ballet folklorico program, the first of its 
kind in the country. Through her continued advocacy, thousands of 
schools,

[[Page E120]]

colleges, and universities worldwide now offer their student musicians 
a mariachi education.
  Ms. Ortiz helped co-found the Mariachi Campanas de America, an award-
winning ensemble of musicians that have performed all across the 
country, bringing the rich history of mariachi to places like the 
Hollywood Bowl, the Kennedy Center, and performed at the White House 
for five different U.S. Presidents.
  An active member of her community in San Antonio, Ms. Ortiz served on 
many local boards and committees, and was a recipient of many lifetime 
achievement awards and honors for her dedication to making mariachi and 
its rich history accessible to generations of aspiring musicians.
  Her life is now being celebrated in the award-winning documentary 
``Suena La Educacion: The Story of Belle Ortiz''. This month, the 
Lanier High School music building in San Antonio, TX, will be renamed 
in her honor.
  In Ms. Ortiz's final days, hundreds of mariachi musicians came to her 
bedside and played for her, paying tribute to this trailblazing icon. 
As the Congressman for the 35th District of Texas, I am honored to 
celebrate the life of Ms. Belle Ortiz, who left behind an incredible 
legacy that transformed mariachi music from a local tradition into a 
worldwide cultural phenomenon.

                   EVERY MONTH IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH

  (Ms. TLAIB asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I want everyone to know and to be very clear 
that every month in the 12th Congressional District is Black History 
Month.
  I was born and raised in the most beautiful, Blackest city in the 
country: the city of Detroit. Countless Black leaders, our neighbors, 
have inspired us all to seek change in the face of segregation, Jim 
Crow, economic injustices, and dehumanizing racism.
  We bore witness in our city to Dr. King's first Walk to Freedom and 
the transformative work of so many of our Black trailblazers, like 
Mother Rosa Parks, James Boggs, Reverend Franklin, and so many others.
  It was on our very streets that the fight for Black liberation and 
civil rights bent the arc of the moral universe in our Nation. From the 
iconic Motown sound to powerful activism, our community's Black history 
has a remarkable legacy.
  The 12th District acknowledges that Black history and Black lives 
matter every single day of the year.
  Please know that you will also have a fighter in me in the United 
States Congress.

                   SUPPORT OF HOSTAGES HELD BY HAMAS

  (Ms. De La CRUZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of the 
hostages being held by Hamas following the October 7 attacks in Israel, 
the worst massacre of the Jews since the Holocaust.
  These individuals, unjustly seized and separated from their families, 
must not be forgotten. Each day in captivity underscores the cruel 
reality of anti-Semitism and terrorism.
  We must continue demanding their immediate release. Their stories, 
etched in our hearts, demand our unwavering commitment to the fight 
against hate. In their names, we must reinforce our stance against 
anti-Semitism in all its forms.
  Let us unite in our efforts to ensure their safe return, keeping 
their families and loved ones in our prayers. We will not rest until 
they are home.

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  Sovereign God, You have marked out our appointed times in history and 
provided the time and space for our lives so that we would seek You, 
reach to You, and find You, for You are never far from us. For in You 
we live and move and have our being.
  So into Your hands we place the U.S. House of Representatives and all 
who labor therein. From this body there is revealed an intricate 
tapestry of hopes and fears, possibility and challenge. Into this 
unique quilt You have woven our talents and treasures, our time and our 
effort.
  We pray then that You would use this sometimes unlikely and unruly 
montage of Members. Reveal Your mercy in our doubt, and even in the 
wavering of our faith, reveal Your glory.
  In our busyness may we find Your quietness. In our quietness may we 
receive Your purpose. Let the favor of the Lord be upon us. Establish 
for us the work of our day, this day and every day.
  In the power to be found only in Your name, we pray.
  Amen.

           BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAGING WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY

  (Mr. CLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, since President Biden took office, his 
administration has waged an unprecedented war on American energy and 
continuously pushed this country into adopting the Green New Deal 
agenda.
  These policies pushed by the global elites have caused energy prices 
to skyrocket, as well as allow for our energy security to be exposed 
before our greatest adversaries, such as China and Iran.
  Two weeks ago, Joe Biden's Department of Energy announced that they

[[Page H436]]

would freeze permits for liquefied gas exports, forcing hardworking 
Americans to spend more on residential uses for natural gas, including 
cooking and heating homes. Furthermore, this decision will hurt our 
farmers as it would force them to spend more on fertilizer.
  The last thing Virginians want is more burdensome regulations pushed 
by the Biden administration, including by their two climate czars, John 
Kerry and John Podesta. These are two individuals who are among the 
Democratic elite and are simply out of touch with everyday Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 987 so the 
American people aren't further burdened with climate change policies 
that we have seen fail throughout the world.
  House Republicans will continue to fight for American energy 
independence on behalf of the American people.

  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor a civil 
servant of Guam, the late vice mayor of Sinajana, Rudy Iriarte.
  Rudy was a proud son of Guam whose service to the island and his 
village of Sinajana never went unnoticed. He had served in public life 
for over 30 years in several capacities through the local government 
and his village.
  Today, we recognize the great visions, accomplishments, and selfless 
service Rudy Iriarte made to our community.
  On behalf of a grateful island and Nation, I extend my deepest and 
utmost condolences to the family of the late vice mayor and thank him 
for his service to making Guam a better place.

             REMEMBERING AND HONORING TROOPER ZACHARY FINK

  (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, in the early morning of February 2, 2024, 
Florida Highway Patrolman Zachary Fink, ID No. 1550, gave his life in 
the line of duty. He served in St. Lucie County, where he was raised 
and where he dedicated everything he had to protecting.
  He will be remembered by all who knew him, and remembered as a man 
you could count on. He was a natural comedian who could deescalate. He 
was an outdoorsman. He was a man deeply proud of his law enforcement 
brothers and sisters, who he himself considered it an honor to be among 
their ranks.
  Mr. Speaker, it is we who have all been honored by Trooper Fink's 
selfless and total commitment to others. I thank God, and I thank his 
parents for giving him to us.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask for silence in recognition of the sacrifice of 
Trooper Zachary Fink.

  (Mr. ROSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Israel Security 
Supplemental Appropriations Act and our ally Israel as it continues its 
fight against Hamas.
  In November, less than 1 month after Hamas terrorists brutally 
attacked Israel, I proudly voted ``yes'' on the Israel Security 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, which would send $14.3 billion in 
emergency aid to our most loyal ally in the Middle East, Israel.
  This bill is fully paid for without increasing the debt or raising 
taxes by offsetting the new spending with cuts to previous funding 
found in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which would hire 
unnecessary additional IRS agents.
  Unfortunately, the Senate refused to pass this bill to provide 
immediate, direct, and much-needed relief for Israel. Instead, they 
have prioritized the funding of an army of IRS agents.
  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that I wholeheartedly stand with Israel and 
its fight against Hamas and for providing much-needed military 
assistance.

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Mr. McClintock for his 
statement. I don't normally agree with very much of what Mr. McClintock 
says, but I want to publicly thank him for being honest.
  If we are being honest with one another, we would not be bringing

             SECRETARY MAYORKAS GUILTY OF MALADMINISTRATION

  (Mr. McCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of 
maladministration of our immigration laws on a cosmic scale, but we 
know that is not grounds for impeachment because the American Founders 
specifically rejected it.
  They didn't want political disputes to become impeachments because 
that would shatter their separation of powers that vests the 
enforcement of the laws with the President--no matter how bad a job he 
does.
  Cabinet Secretaries can't serve two masters. They can be impeached 
for committing a crime relating to their office, but not for carrying 
out Presidential policy.
  This border crisis can't be fixed by replacing one leftwing official 
with another. It can only be fixed by the American people at the ballot 
box by replacing this administration with one committed to securing our 
borders, defending our country, and upholding the rule of law. 
Americans are already coming to that conclusion.
  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that stunts like this don't help.

                       BIDENOMICS FAILS FAMILIES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the failed policies of 
Biden and Democrats are costing American families over $11,400 more a 
year to buy the basics. The dollar stores I shop at are now $1.25.
  When Biden took office, inflation was just 1.4 percent. Since then, 
inflation has risen by 17.2 percent. Over the last year, families are 
paying 20 percent more for car insurance, 19 percent more for frozen 
juice, 11 percent more for beef steak, 10 percent more for 
transportation, and 7 percent more for baby food and formula.
  House Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to 
fight to pass legislation to reduce inflation and create jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected 
America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving 
from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders for 
terrorists.
  It is sadly clear that there will be more 9/11 attacks across America 
imminent in our country as warned by the FBI. Families need a rally 
point now for safety when communications are cut.

               LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great sadness and with great 
disappointment.
  America is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and 
continually tells the world that we will protect them to be lands of 
the free and the home of the brave.
  Yet this week, we are about to consider a bill that tells people, 
particularly those in distress, we don't care. I believe all of us want 
to defend Israel and give her the resources she needs,

[[Page H437]]

but the people in Ukraine want to be the land of the free and the home 
of the brave, and yet we continue to stand silent.
  I rise, Mr. Speaker, to say that it is beneath the principles, image, 
and reality of America that we are not passing a comprehensive bill to 
make sure that whether you are in Asia, the Middle East, or any place 
else, we will help you be the land of the free and the home of the 
brave.
  Let's do that, Mr. Speaker. Let's do it now.

          FIGHTING TO PROTECT FREELANCERS AND INDEPENDENT WORK

  (Mr. KILEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Labor has announced a new 
independent contractor rule, which, in fact, targets independent 
contractors across America.
  It is based upon AB5, a truly destructive California law that has 
devastated independent professionals in over 600 professions.
  In hopes of trying to get this House to act to stop this rule from 
taking effect next month, I am sharing the stories of California 
freelancers and independent contractors who have been harmed by AB5, 
which President Biden has called his model for national labor 
relations.
  One story comes from Jodie. Jodie said: I worked years to gain my 
skills as an American Sign Language interpreter. It was my goal since I 
was 9 years old. After AB5, I lost all three of my agencies. The dream 
I worked for is lost. I can't provide for my family and thousands of 
California deaf won't be served.
  In order to spare millions of Americans the same fate as Jodie, I am 
asking for bipartisan support for my legislation under the 
Congressional Review Act to nullify the Biden administration's new 
independent contractor rule.

                BRING KEITH SIEGEL AND ALL HOSTAGES HOME

  (Mr. MILLER of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of 
Keith Samuel Siegel.
  Keith was born in the United States and has worked and lived 
alongside both Jews and Arabs and treasures them all equally. He lives 
and loves coexistence. His family says he is a man of an innate faith 
in the goodness of humankind.
  Like all of us, he has a family that loves him dearly and friends 
whose lives are richer because of him.
  On October 7, Keith was one of more than 240 who were kidnapped by 
Hamas. He is one of more than 100 hostages still being held captive in 
Gaza, enduring unthinkable torture and trauma.
  I stand here today to demand that Hamas release Keith immediately, 
along with all of the remaining hostages. Israel has proven its 
willingness to pause the fighting for hostages to be returned home. 
Nonetheless, Hamas continues to hold more than 100 hostages taken 
during its despicable acts on October 7; 8 of them believed to be 
Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time to bring Keith home. It is time to bring all 
of them home.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). The gentleman from Texas is 
recognized for 1 hour.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the 
purpose of debate only.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 996, providing for the consideration 
of two measures: H.R. 485 and H. Res. 863.
  The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 485 under a 
structured rule with 1 hour of debate and H. Res. 863 under a closed 
rule with 2 hours of debate, equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and the ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction, 
or their designees. The rule provides for one motion to recommit for 
H.R. 485.
  The rule also deems passed H. Res. 995, which appoints the 
impeachment managers. I will also mention that all amendments offered 
to H.R. 485 were made in order.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying 
bills H. Res. 863, Impeaching Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of 
Homeland

[[Page H438]]

Security, for high crimes and misdemeanors; and H.R. 485, the 
Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2023.
  Today, this body begins consideration of one of its most solemn 
constitutional duties: the consideration of Articles of Impeachment 
against a Federal official.
  H. Res. 863, Impeaching Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of 
Homeland Security, for high crimes and misdemeanors includes two 
Articles of Impeachment: willful and systematic refusal to comply with 
the law and breach of public trust.
  On February 2, 2021, Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as the seventh 
United States Secretary of Homeland Security by Vice President Kamala 
Harris. On this day, Secretary Mayorkas solemnly swore to support and 
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic.
  He swore that he took this sacred obligation freely without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion and swore to faithfully 
discharge the duties of the office.
  Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that this oath of office sworn on 
February 2, 2021, has, indeed, been broken.
  Since President Biden took office, United States Customs and Border 
Protection has encountered more than 7 million illegal migrants along 
the southwest border; 3.3 million have been released into the United 
States interior, including 312 individuals on the Terrorist Screening 
Data Set.
  In 2003, Customs and Border Protection encountered over 2.5 million 
illegal migrants attempting to cross the United States southern border. 
That is an all-time high for a fiscal year.
  In December alone, Customs and Border Protection encountered 302,000 
illegal migrants attempting to cross the United States southern border, 
the highest number of unlawful migrant crossings in a single month in 
recorded history.
  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas has shown willful and systematic 
refusal to comply with the law time and time again. He has willfully 
refused to comply with numerous detention requirements spelled out in 
the Immigration and Nationality Act but has instead implemented a mass 
catch and release program, whereby apprehended illegal migrants are 
released into the interior of our country without any effective way to 
ensure their return before an immigration court.
  Secretary Mayorkas has also willfully misused parole authority laid 
out in the Immigration and Nationality Act that permits parole to be 
granted only on a case-by-case basis, temporarily, and for urgent 
humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.
  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas has not only failed in his solemn 
statutory duty to control and guard the border of the United States, to 
protect and defend this country and the Constitution, but he has also 
breached the public trust.

                              {time}  1230

  Secretary Mayorkas has willfully failed to put in place or enforce 
initiatives that he abandoned that would enable the Department of 
Homeland Security to maintain operational control of our southwest 
border. He has also breached the trust of Congress and the American 
people by knowingly making false statements about the results of his 
refusal to comply with the law.
  The American people, and certainly those that I represent in Texas, 
have had enough of the Secretary's lies. Despite undeniable evidence 
that his gross negligence toward securing our southern border is 
endangering American families and communities across the country, 
Secretary Mayorkas thinks what he is doing is just fine, but he could 
not be more wrong.
  Contrary to what the Secretary says, the border is not secure. 
America is, in fact, less safe because of his negligence and because of 
his numerous failures. Since Secretary Mayorkas will not resign, 
Congress must take this action.
  Every day that Secretary Mayorkas remains as the head of the 
Department of Homeland Security is another day of pathetic disservice 
to the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, many of us have been to the border. I have been many 
times, and I have seen how understaffed, unsupported, and 
underresourced the Customs and Border Patrol is. My friends on the 
other side of the aisle might have you believe it is not because of a 
lack of funding. While more funding may be helpful for better 
technology or building and repairing the border wall, it will not make 
up for the time spent by Customs and Border Patrol agents at the 
funerals of their coworkers or time spent wondering if they are next.
  It is shameful that these brave men and women aren't getting the 
support that they need. The Biden administration's policy of open 
borders and amnesty is killing Americans, and Alejandro Mayorkas, whose 
primary job it is to secure the homeland, refuses to do his job.
  The worsening conditions of the men and women who have sworn to 
protect our border and actually honored that oath is unacceptable. We 
must hold those accountable who have willfully refused to honor their 
oath.
  Mr. Speaker, this rule also allows for consideration of H.R. 485, the 
Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act, that I introduced along 
with Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Chairman Smith, and my friend from Ohio, Dr. Wenstrup. This bill aims 
to preserve access to lifesaving cures and to prevent discrimination 
for Americans with disabilities.
  I practiced medicine for nearly 30 years. I treated each patient as a 
human being, not just a diagnosis. Quality-adjusted life years 
measurements are cruel and hinder the physician's ability to care for 
and treat all patients with dignity. The government should never be 
able to decide or determine the value of a life to approve or deny 
care.
  Mr. Speaker, many years ago, the Affordable Care Act banned Medicare 
from using quality-adjusted life years, a metric often used in cost-
effective analyses widely known to discriminate against people with 
disabilities. The purpose of the quality-adjusted life year metric 
assigns a person living with a disability a lower value of a year of 
life than a person who is considered to be in good health.
  The quality-adjusted life year often fails to consider outcomes 
meaningful to patients, such as the impact on the ability to work or 
the impact on caregiving needs. In a quality-adjusted life year base 
assessment, a person living with conditions like heart disease, ALS, or 
sickle cell disease will be considered to be of less worth than someone 
else.
  Often, quality-adjusted life years are used by countries that have 
government-controlled healthcare systems to devalue treatment for those 
with chronic conditions and disabilities. This concept has been pushed 
by socialist healthcare advocates for years. Thankfully, the United 
States of America has not fallen totally prey to these harmful 
ideologies, at least not yet.
  I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the first 
quality-adjusted life year ban within the Affordable Care Act passed 
with strong Democrat support. Therefore, this bill should be passed 
with strong Democrat support, as well.
  It is not the government's place to determine whether a person living 
with a chronic condition or a disability is of less worth. This is why 
we need to prohibit the use of quality-adjusted life years in all 
Federal programs and ensure that all human life has inherent value. 
Republicans will continue to work to reduce the government's hand in 
healthcare, and I urge colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 485.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the rule and the underlying 
bills. I urge my fellow Members to support the rule, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for Texas for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  This impeachment resolution was supposed to be our second rule of the 
day. We had an emergency meeting last week in the Rules Committee about 
fixing SALT. Everybody hurry up, it is an emergency. Better do it right 
away so we can vote quickly. Then--get this--last night a change was 
made to pull their emergency bill from the schedule. It was such an 
emergency that Republicans decided it is not an emergency at all.

[[Page H439]]

  Not only did their bill not even fix the problem that they, 
themselves, created, it is not even going to come to the floor now 
because of their inability to govern. This majority is so incompetent, 
they couldn't even manufacture a fake vote to pretend New York 
Republicans are good at legislating.
  We wasted hours last Thursday at the Rules Committee debating a rule 
that has now been pulled from consideration--and for what? Will the 
gentleman from Texas tell us next that he is glad he had to sit through 
a hearing on a rule his leadership can't even bring up because they are 
so bad at governing? This Republican-led House is an unmitigated 
disaster. I would say it is a clown show, but that would be a 
disservice to actual working clowns.

  That brings us to the second emergency rule. Mr. Speaker, impeachment 
is one of the most solemn, serious, somber things that we can do in 
this body. It is not something that ought to get thrown around lightly 
or invoked when you disagree with someone or you don't like their 
policies or you think they are doing a bad job.
  It is something that should happen after a grave constitutional 
offense has been committed, a crime against the Republic. The Founders 
in Article I reserve it only for treason, bribery, or other high crimes 
and misdemeanors.
  Consequently, today, I am very confused because our Republican 
colleagues have presented zero evidence for impeachment. This could be 
the first time in American history an impeachment will go to the floor 
of the United States House of Representatives with no evidence, no 
proof, no elements of a crime, nothing at all.
  You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to the lead Republican 
for immigration policy, our colleague,   Tom McClintock. He says: ``The 
problem is they [the Articles] fail to identify an impeachable crime 
that Mayorkas has committed. In effect, they stretch and distort the 
Constitution in order to hold the administration accountable. . . .''
  Another Republican,   Ken Buck, says: Secretary Mayorkas did not 
commit an impeachable offense and is not guilty of high crimes or 
misdemeanors.
  These are not my words. These are your fellow colleagues, Mr. 
Speaker, openly admitting that these vague, unprecedented Articles of 
Impeachment trivialize this process and make a total mockery of this 
institution. What does this impeachment have to do with fixing our 
challenges at the border? Nothing at all.
  They say this is about securing the border, and their plan to secure 
the border is to impeach the guy responsible for securing the border 
and replace him with--now wait for this, wait for it--they aren't sure. 
The chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security couldn't tell us 
during our Rules Committee meeting who will replace Secretary Mayorkas 
if he were removed. I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
  For months and months and months, Republicans have said that they 
would shut down the government, they would default on our debt, refuse 
to do anything unless we passed a border bill. Well, good news. Senate 
Republicans worked out a border bill, and the person who negotiated it 
for Republicans, Senator Lankford, was someone Donald Trump endorsed. 
Donald Trump said that Senator Lankford is ``strong on the border.'' 
Therefore, I am shocked by the Republican rejection of Senator 
Lankford's bill.
  Before we even saw what was in it, before the ink was even dry on the 
discussion draft, Donald Trump came out, and he ordered them to kill 
it. He ordered them to do nothing to fix our broken immigration system. 
They would rather let chaos prevail than work with Democrats to have a 
conversation about a path forward.
  Here is the truth, Mr. Speaker. Republicans simply do not want to 
participate in government. They want to create chaos. They want to 
create confusion, and they want to create a campaign issue for Donald 
Trump going into the next election. They are not interested in solving 
problems. They only want to gain power.
  That is the real dereliction of duty here: House Republicans' refusal 
to address our challenges at the border because Donald Trump told them 
he wants a crisis so he can help his campaign, so he can hide from his 
crimes.
  Well, they own this now. Republicans own this now. They own the 
border. They own the fentanyl crisis. They own it all because they 
refuse to behave like adults. They are acting like spoiled, rotten 
children who got what they want and still can't take ``yes'' for an 
answer, but they own all of this now.
  If anyone needs more proof than that, look no further than the 
sponsor of this resolution--Marjorie Taylor Greene, a MAGA extremist 
who amplifies Holocaust deniers, who said 9/11 was a hoax, who says 
wildfires are started by Jewish space lasers. That is the legislative 
and intellectual force behind this impeachment resolution. In fact, if 
it passes, she is going to be an impeachment manager on the floor of 
the United States Senate. God help us.
  It is just more proof that this is fraudulent, unconstitutional 
garbage, but Donald Trump wants another fraudulent impeachment, another 
distraction from his own legal troubles, another excuse to kill a 
bipartisan border deal instead of working across the aisle to get 
something done.
  Here we are, because Trump calls the shots around here. He directed 
Speaker Johnson and extreme MAGA Republicans not to work with Democrats 
to address challenges at the border. One thing we know, Republicans 
work for Trump, not for the voters. They worship and they work for 
Donald Trump, who doesn't care about anybody but himself. They are 
frightened to death of the former President.
  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas is a good man, a decent man, someone 
who is trying to do his job despite the fact that Republicans refuse to 
give him the tools needed to do what they are asking him to do. He is 
an honorable public servant who respects law enforcement and takes 
seriously his oath of office and his obligation to uphold and enforce 
the law.
  In smearing his good name, Republicans are only impeaching themselves 
and showing that all their rhetoric about the border has been nothing 
more than a bunch of BS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Roy), a fellow member of the Rules Committee.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I get no great joy being on the floor of the 
House of Representatives and talking about something as important and 
solemn as the removal of a Secretary of one of our Departments, 
particularly one as important as the Department that is in charge of 
homeland security. This is an individual who was appointed and then 
confirmed by the United States Senate. Impeachment is one of the 
highest charges we have as Members of the United States House of 
Representatives.

  The charge by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, 
particularly the ranking member on the Rules Committee, that this is a 
political exercise or that there are individuals taking ``orders'' from 
former President Trump, I think indicates the extent to which my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle desperately want to make this 
political.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle desperately want to take 
the abject and total failure of Democrat leadership on the southern 
border, resulting in death and destruction of the American people, the 
undermining of economic activity, the death of our children, fentanyl 
pouring into schools, ranchers who are getting absolutely decimated, 
the empowerment of cartels, and the empowerment of China.
  This has all happened at record levels, record numbers, and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle know this. Therefore, they 
are desperately trying to deflect, deflect to legislation that was 
political and never had a chance to move from the Senate to the House, 
never had a chance to move, but they want to be able to deflect. They 
want to deflect an entire conversation about the failures of President 
Biden and the failures of Secretary Mayorkas to secure the border by 
not having a serious conversation about why we would be bringing 
Articles of Impeachment against a sitting Secretary.

                              {time}  1245

  The reason is simple: The Secretary of Homeland Security has 
blatantly ignored the laws of the United States he is charged to 
faithfully execute.
  He has done so with reckless abandon. He has done so in a way that 
has

[[Page H440]]

led directly to the death of American citizens and to the death of the 
very migrants that the Secretary suggests they want to try to help.
  A thousand migrants along the southwest border are dead, and 53 
migrants died in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio last year in the 
district I represent. Mr. Speaker, 75,000 Americans died from fentanyl 
poisoning last year.
  These numbers are off the charts, at levels we have never seen 
before, and they are the direct result of the policies enacted by the 
Biden administration but very specifically by the Secretary of Homeland 
Security. It is his leadership of that Department that has led to an 
abject failure of the Department to secure the border.
  It is not the line men and women of the Border Patrol or ICE who are 
out there trying to do their jobs. They are being denied the ability to 
do their jobs because the Secretary won't let them. The Secretary has 
turned them into processing machines. He has done so intentionally to 
flood the zone, and they basically acknowledge that.
  He has turned the law upside down. The basic law requiring that they 
have operational control of the border, that we stop the flow, that you 
have to have papers to come to the United States has been turned upside 
down.
  In its place, the administration, and specifically Secretary 
Mayorkas, has used exceptions to swallow the rule: exceptions for 
asylum, exceptions under parole that are supposed to be on a case-by-
case basis, based on our benevolence as human beings to try to help 
people, a bipartisan desire to do so. We have been made to swallow the 
rule of actual border security. As a result, the numbers have been 
astounding.
  The key considerations, of course, are the types of individuals that 
are coming into the United States. We are not talking about some 
workers who want to go from Nuevo Laredo to Laredo or Juarez to El 
Paso. We are talking about dangerous individuals from all over the 
globe, including 331 that have been encountered that are associated 
with terrorist organizations under this administration, under Mayorkas' 
watch, which compares to 11 under President Trump.
  They say: Well, aren't they doing their job? They encountered them. 
No. Those numbers indicate who we are finding, not the 50,000 a month 
or so got-aways that are pouring into the United States.
  Now we see cops being beaten in the streets of New York by people who 
are here illegally walking out of the court with no bail and flicking 
off the American people.
  We have a woman being dragged out of a parking garage in New York by 
migrant gangs, dragged through the streets of New York.
  We have all sorts of danger to the American people, people like a 
cheerleader getting killed in Texas by somebody here illegally and an 
illegal who posed as an unaccompanied child who lived with a family in 
Florida and then killed the family.
  That is what we have happening in the United States of America, and 
it is directly a consequence of a Secretary of Homeland Security who is 
failing to secure the homeland as he is charged to do when he takes an 
oath to fulfill his duty to carry out the laws of the United States.
  If the Attorney General just went out and ordered all the United 
States attorneys and prosecutors and assistant U.S. attorneys to stop 
enforcing the law, allow reckless abandon, he should be impeached. That 
is, in fact, a high crime and misdemeanor.
  This is where I disagree with my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle and a few, I think, on my side of the aisle, this notion of high 
crimes and misdemeanors and what it includes or does not include. It 
most certainly includes officials in the administration, in the 
executive branch, who are completely refusing to carry out their duty. 
Literally, his job is to secure the homeland, and he is refusing to do 
it.
  The fact of the matter is, some of my colleagues have concerns about 
issues of maladministration and so forth. If you believe this is 
maladministration--and I do not. I think it goes beyond 
maladministration. It is the purposeful, willing ignoring of the law to 
endanger the American people. It goes beyond maladministration.
  Even if you accept the notion that it is maladministration, I keep 
hearing people say: Well, the Founders rejected maladministration.
  The fact of the matter is Colonel Mason put it forward. Mr. Gerry put 
it forward, seconded it. Mr. Madison raised a concern. He said the term 
would be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.
  There was some debate. Gouverneur Morris, Colonel Mason withdrew 
maladministration. There was no vote. There was no affirmative 
rejection of it. There was a debate. They withdrew. Instead, in its 
place, he substituted--the language was not there at the time--other 
high crimes and misdemeanors.
  Now, you go back and say: Well, what does that mean? Well, I wasn't 
there. You can go back and look. There are debates about what it meant.
  One thing is, British common law had developed a definition of high 
crimes and misdemeanors that included but was not limited to 
maladministration.
  Now, this is a debate worthy of academic debate, but the fact is, it 
is up to us. There are no elements of the crime in the Constitution. 
There is no specific requirement that there be a violation of statute. 
There is no mens rea in the Constitution. It is for us and us alone to 
determine.
  When the Secretary violates his duty to the Constitution, violates 
his oath to defend the people of the United States and secure the 
homeland, then it is incumbent upon this body to call out and reject 
that Secretary--in this case, that Secretary being Secretary Mayorkas.
  There are other tools at our disposal, but there are not many. We 
have the power of the purse. We should use it. That is a speech for 
another time.

  One last point on this notion that somehow by rejecting the bill that 
the Senate was debating and that, by the way, has not been sent to us--
the Senate is merely debating it. They are not even debating it yet. 
They haven't even proceeded to it yet. They haven't even gotten past 
cloture on proceeding to it yet.
  Why? Because it is fundamentally flawed. The bill does not do what my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle are suggesting it does.
  I am sorry. You are getting punched in the head 10 times. My 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to say: Well, sorry. We 
will just start punching you in the head five times. Why won't you take 
that half a loaf?
  I am sorry. That is not how this works. That is not what we are here 
to do. We are actually here to stop the flow.
  That bill was flawed. It would have set essentially in permanent 
stone, effectively, mass migration. It has 250,000 visas and 250,000 
work permits.
  It ensconces alternatives to detention as part of how the releases 
would work for asylum claims. It would spend $4 billion to hire up new 
asylum officers by this administration, by this Secretary, who has the 
power right now to stop this flow but refuses to use it.
  The President of the United States could use 212(f) right now and 
stop the flow. The Secretary could apply the laws the way they are 
supposed to be applied with respect to asylum and parole. He could stop 
it right now but refuses to do so.
  We are here to defend the people of the United States who don't have 
a voice. We are here to stand up for the forgotten men and women of 
this country who are tired of getting rolled over.
  That is why we are here, and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
deserves to be held accountable. I rise in support.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas just took almost 10 minutes--10 
minutes of my life which I will never get back--and still didn't get it 
right, which is basically that this move to impeach Secretary Mayorkas 
is a sham. There is no basis for this.
  Just because you don't like the guy or disagree with the policies of 
this administration is not a reason--it is not a high crime and 
misdemeanor. It is not a reason to move forward on impeachment.
  I am listening to the gentleman and also my colleague from Texas. 
Republicans are really good about complaining about things, talking 
about what the problems are. We agree with

[[Page H441]]

some of the things that have been highlighted, that they are problems. 
What my Republican friends are not really good at is actually solving a 
problem or getting to yes on anything.
  The gentleman from Texas said: Oh, we are asked to consider a Senate 
bill that the Senate hasn't acted on. Wait a minute. The Speaker of 
this House of Representatives has already said he will not have a vote 
in this House, no matter what happens in the United States Senate.
  Donald Trump, the guy you are all afraid of, has been making calls 
saying: You better not do this. You better not do this.
  The author of this Senate bill--again, I haven't read it all--there 
is lots of stuff in it that gives me heartburn, from what I can tell, 
but the guy who wrote it was a Senator from Oklahoma who Donald Trump 
says is strong on the border.
  I will repeat what I said before: What we are doing today does 
nothing to help anything at the border--not a thing, not one thing.
  Any opportunity to do something requires working in a bipartisan way 
to move a bill forward, which apparently my Republican friends here in 
the House do not want to do.
  That is a shame, but here is the deal: You now own this. This is a 
problem that you are maintaining, that you have deliberately decided 
that you will own, because you will do nothing.
  You are blocking any attempt for any kind of legislation to come to 
this floor that has a chance of passing in a bipartisan way and getting 
signed into law. You are doing it. Even the Border Patrol union has 
endorsed what the Senate is doing.
  I haven't read the whole thing yet. I bet you none of you have 
either. Even before the ink was dry on the draft copy, Trump gave you 
the orders to kill it, and that is where we are.
  Complaining about a problem, I get it. Maybe it used to be good 
politics, but here is what I am predicting. The American people are 
watching. They are now seeing how this works. If we want a bill, if we 
want to work in a bipartisan way, there is a bipartisan coalition that 
developed in the Senate, led by a very conservative Republican Senator, 
and they come up with a bill. As soon as they do: No, we don't want to 
solve the problem. We want to continue the problem for political 
purposes.
  So now you own all of this. You own all of this.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a member of the Rules Committee.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, reasonable Republicans and even The 
Wall Street Journal editorial board have written that this impeachment 
does not qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors.
  The board wrote: ``Grandstanding is easier than governing, and 
Republicans have to decide whether to accomplish anything other than 
impeaching Democrats. . . . [I]mpeaching him accomplishes nothing 
beyond political symbolism.'' That is right. It is political symbolism. 
It is political theater.
  Our immigration system is broken. We have been saying it, and we have 
been offering up a bipartisan solution that Republicans have refused to 
take up.
  They just blew up a bipartisan deal in the Senate. They refuse to 
provide Secretary Mayorkas the resources and legal changes he needs to 
reform the immigration system so our border is secure, our policies are 
humane, and our country is richer, thanks to the immeasurable 
contributions of our immigrant workforce.
  Instead, we have a clown show directed by Marjorie Taylor Greene. If 
we vote for this sham impeachment in the House, she will have the power 
to march over to the Senate and stop all their work. She will stop work 
on a budget that we need to keep our government open. She will stop 
work on the farm bill, which my rural communities need. She will stop 
work on policies to lower costs and expand the middle class.
  Extreme Republicans have answered The Wall Street Journal's question: 
Do they want to govern? They don't want to govern. They want chaos, 
chaos at the border, chaos in Congress. They put chaos over people.
  They always put politics over people. We cannot trust them to reform 
our immigration system in a bipartisan manner.
  They continue to use immigration as a political bulldozer to destroy 
and divide. Their abuse of this solemn impeachment process shows us we 
cannot trust them with our Constitution. We cannot trust them.

                              {time}  1300

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
  Mr. Speaker, what is needed is border security. What is needed is 
border protection. Immigration reform can come later after border 
security is established.
  So a discussion about what is happening over in the Senate, to me, 
until you get the border secured, you have no opportunity to discuss 
any type of immigration reform.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas to ask 
this question:
  Does he agree or disagree that to change enforcement we must change 
the law? Does he agree that we need to change the law if we are going 
to change enforcement?
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr Speaker, I would recommend to the gentleman to 
enforce existing law as a starting point.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I am using Dr. Burgess' words from 6/18/2018 when he said: We know that 
to change enforcement we must change the law.
  Then he went on to talk about immigration bills that we might 
consider in Congress, and he talked about the importance of 
legislation, and this is how democracy works.
  So the bottom line is, Republicans are really good about complaining 
but they are not so good at legislating. They are not so good at 
getting things done. When things begin to move in the direction where 
we may get something done, then they back away and they say no. They 
can't get to yes on anything.
  That is not leadership. That is not governing. That is, frankly, 
incompetence. When Trump was President my friends were saying one 
thing, and now that Biden is President, they are saying another thing.
  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is if we are going to get something 
done, we need to come together in a bipartisan way. That is what has 
begun to happen over in the Senate.
  For the life of me, I do not understand why the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, why my colleagues on the Republican side, one after 
another after another do not want to do anything.
  Well, you know what, if you do not want to do anything, that means 
you are satisfied with the status quo and you own this problem. This is 
a problem of your creation because we are trying to fix it and we are 
trying to work in a bipartisan way.
  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an 
amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 12, a bill that would ensure 
every American has full access to a central reproductive healthcare, 
including abortion care.
  Far too many States have enacted laws to either ban some or all 
abortions, which many Republicans have declared numerous times is their 
goal.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the Record along with any extraneous material immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous question.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Obernolte). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick) to discuss that proposal.
  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 12, the Women's Health Protection Act of 2023.
  As a woman, a mother of two teenagers, and a Member of Congress, I 
was proud to cosponsor this legislation, and look forward to the day 
when we as a Congress enshrine a Federal law to reestablish a 
nationwide right to abortion.

[[Page H442]]

  Abortion is healthcare, and access to healthcare saves many lives.
  In Texas, Kate Cox was forced to flee her home State to receive 
lifesaving care after the Texas Supreme Court decided she wasn't close 
enough to dying to receive an abortion, despite four emergency room 
visits, elevated vitals, and a risk of uterine rupture.
  In my home State of Florida, Deborah Dorbert was forced to give birth 
to her son, who died in her arms shortly after he was born, just as 
doctors predicted. For an agonizing 13 weeks, Deborah was forced to 
carry a baby she knew would die, which left her with severe anxiety and 
depression.
  In Ohio, Brittany Watts, a Black woman, was criminally charged after 
having a miscarriage at home, after doctors found that her water broke 
prematurely and the fetus she was carrying would not survive.
  In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning half a century of 
precedent, we have women nationwide who are at risk of losing their 
lives every single day.
  Women in States with abortion bans are nearly three times more likely 
to die from childbirth, and Black women have the highest maternal 
mortality rates in the U.S., three times higher than White women.
  Being forced to give birth means Black women will die, and if they 
don't die, they will be jailed for miscarrying an unviable fetus.
  This could be your wife, your daughter, your sister, or even me, 
whose life is at risk unless we receive an abortion. How can any doctor 
tell a woman that her life cannot be saved when we know it can.
  This is reprehensible. Congress must pass H.R. 12, the Women's 
Healthcare Protection Act of 2023.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Chu for sponsoring this 
legislation.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I further inquire as to engaging in 
personalities or destruction of personalities? Is that something we are 
now doing on the floor of the House?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is not going to respond to 
hypotheticals or provide advisory opinions.
  Mr. BURGESS. It wasn't a hypothetical; it was what was said on the 
other side.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All Members are reminded that remarks should 
be addressed to the Chair and not to engage in personalities.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
  Mr. Speaker, we can talk about existing authority that the President 
has today that he could use to solve the problem at our southern 
border. He could end catch and release, reinstate the remain in Mexico 
policy, enter into asylum cooperative agreements with other countries, 
end parole abuses, detain inadmissible aliens, use expedited removal, 
rein in taxpayer-funded benefits for people who are in the country 
illegally, and issue a proclamation to suspend or restrict entry.
  All those are available to the President right now, today, to solve 
this problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, again, the gentleman from Texas confuses me because not 
too long ago--and I will use one of his quotes--he said: ``President 
Trump has presented a clear path forward; however, he cannot solve this 
crisis alone.''
  Those are the gentleman's words.
  Congress must stand ready to put partisan politics aside and pass 
meaningful solutions, but now all of a sudden Joe Biden can do it 
alone?
  I mean, when Trump was President, he needed Congress, according to 
the gentleman, to give him the ability to be able to do what he wants 
on the border. Now, all of a sudden, it is a different story because it 
is a different President.
  Mr. Speaker, let me also address something that the other gentleman 
from Texas mentioned in his 10 minutes of remarks when he said 
something about this isn't about politics.
  I would point out that in April of 2023, Chairman Green, who is the 
chair of the Homeland Security Committee, promised Republican donors 
that he would produce an impeachment case against Secretary Mayorkas--
before donors.
  According to a recording of Chairman Green's remarks to campaign 
contributors, he said: ``On April 19, next week, get the popcorn--
Alejandro Mayorkas comes before our committee, and it's going to be 
fun.''
  Chairman Green also said: ``That'll really be just the beginning for 
him.''
  The chairman said those things 2 months prior to the committee 
formally announcing its so-called investigation--2 months prior, Mr. 
Speaker.
  He already promised his Republican donors that he would deliver 
impeachment charges.
  To be clear, this entire impeachment process has had a predetermined 
outcome. This has nothing to do with a legitimate case for impeachment, 
but it has everything to do with Republicans' mission to distract, 
deflect, and exact revenge for President Biden winning the 2022 
election.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the New 
York Times article titled: ``Key Republican Tells Donors He Will Pursue 
Impeachment of Mayorkas.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.

                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2023]

   Key Republican Tells Donors He Will Pursue Impeachment of Mayorkas

                         (By Karoun Demirjian)

       Washington.--The Republican chairman of the House Homeland 
     Security Committee promised donors this month that he would 
     produce an impeachment case against the Biden 
     administration's homeland security chief, Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas, saying that the secretary's appearance before the 
     panel this week would be the beginning of his demise.
       Representative Mark E. Green told an enthusiastic crowd in 
     his home state of Tennessee last week that his committee 
     would expose Mr. Mayorkas's ``dereliction of duty and his 
     intentional destruction of our country through the open 
     southern border.'' He said the panel would deliver charges to 
     the House Judiciary Committee, which handles impeachment 
     proceedings, according to an audio recording of a House 
     Freedom Caucus fund-raiser obtained by The New York Times.
       He said he had a ``five-phase plan'' for doing so and that 
     the Homeland Security Committee would ``put together a 
     packet, and we will hand it to Jim Jordan and let Jim do what 
     Jim does best.''
       Mr. Green apparently was referring to Representative Jim 
     Jordan, the Ohio Republican who leads the Judiciary panel. 
     His comments made clear that G.O.P. leaders are serious about 
     their threats to impeach Mr. Mayorkas. He said the plan would 
     start with an appearance by the secretary before his 
     committee on Wednesday.
       ``On April 19, next week, get the popcorn--Alejandro 
     Mayorkas comes before our committee, and it's going to be 
     fun,'' Mr. Green told the room, adding: ``That'll really be 
     just the beginning for him.''
       A spokeswoman for Mr. Green did not respond to requests for 
     comment.
       Mr. Green and other Republican leaders have made no secret 
     of their desire to pursue impeachment charges against Mr. 
     Mayorkas. Speaker Kevin McCarthy began threatening to impeach 
     him months before Mr. McCarthy won his gavel. But their 
     ambitions have been limited thus far by the political 
     realities of the House; not every Republican wants to 
     demonize Mr. Mayorkas as solely responsible for the country's 
     immigration problems, and with a slim majority, party leaders 
     do not yet have the votes to impeach him.
       As a result, Mr. Green and other House Republicans in 
     positions of authority have been careful to avoid promising 
     publicly that they would find evidence against Mr. Mayorkas 
     worthy of prosecution. Behind closed doors with core 
     supporters, however, Mr. Green was less cautious, using the 
     issue to whip up the crowd.
       During a public session on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before 
     the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, 
     Republicans hammered Mr. Mayorkas both for the border 
     situation and for recent revelations, documented in an 
     investigation by The New York Times, that unaccompanied 
     migrant children have been exploited as laborers. Both 
     Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Josh Hawley of Missouri 
     demanded that the secretary resign.
       Mr. Mayorkas pushed back, saying his department was not 
     responsible for the child labor crisis.
       ``You are incorrectly attributing it to our policies,'' he 
     told Mr. Hawley. He also disputed the idea that he could be 
     held personally responsible for the problems at the border, 
     telling senators: ``Our asylum system is broken, our entire 
     immigration system is broken, and in desperate need of 
     reform--and it's been so for years and years.''

[[Page H443]]

       The Department of Homeland Security has dismissed calls for 
     Mr. Mayorkas to step down as ``baseless'' and ``reckless,'' 
     and Mr. Mayorkas has suggested in past interviews that the 
     efforts to impeach him were simply a way of turbocharging 
     policy disputes with the administration.
       Mr. Green made his comments at an event billed as a 
     ``V.I.P. Reception and Conversation with Conservative 
     Heroes,'' where he appeared behind closed doors alongside Mr. 
     Jordan and other hard-right Republicans. He pointed to recent 
     testimony before his panel by Raul L. Ortiz, the Border 
     Patrol chief, who detailed ``an increase in flow'' in five of 
     the nine sectors along the U.S.-Mexico border and said it had 
     ``caused a considerable strain on our resources.''
       He also recalled Mr. Ortiz's testimony that the United 
     States does not have ``operational control'' of the southern 
     border, which Republicans seized on to accuse Mr. Mayorkas, 
     who had testified that the border is secure, of dishonesty. 
     Mr. Mayorkas addressed the apparent discrepancy during a 
     separate hearing last month, telling senators that he was 
     using a different definition of ``operational security,'' and 
     that the two statements were not in conflict.
       Mr. Green nonetheless trumpeted Mr. Ortiz's words as a kill 
     shot against Mr. Mayorkas, telling the donors that ``he'll 
     see that video a couple of times'' during the upcoming 
     hearing before the Homeland Security panel.
       The secretary's appearances on Capitol Hill this week come 
     as the Republican House is barreling ahead with what Mr. 
     Green told donors would be ``the most conservative border 
     security bill that this Congress has ever seen, or any 
     Congress has ever seen.'' The panel is expected to debate 
     that bill next week.
       On Wednesday, while Mr. Mayorkas is testifying before the 
     Homeland Security panel, the Judiciary Committee is scheduled 
     to debate a second border security bill aimed at restricting 
     migrant inflows, including by restricting access to asylum 
     and requiring all employers to adopt an electronic system 
     that screens prospective employees' eligibility to work.

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I am very 
distressed about is that many of my Republican colleagues who are upset 
that Donald Trump lost the last election and they were not able to 
overturn the free and fair results of that election, they are upset 
that they didn't get their way, and they weren't able to overturn the 
results.
  So now this is kind of a continuation of that effort to deny the 
legitimate results of the election. This in many respects is a 
continuation of what happened here on January 6, and it really is sad.
  There is another election coming up in November. I predict that my 
friends will understand better then that their policy of obstruction, 
impeachment, distraction, and not wanting to solve problems, I think 
they will realize that when people go to the ballot box, that is not 
what they want.
  The American people want us to work together to get something done. 
We have a serious situation at the border. We are trying to provide 
President Biden with the tools to be able to act. Just as my friend 
said that Donald Trump needed the legislative tools to be able to get 
what he wanted to get done--and unfortunately, notwithstanding some 
very impressive bipartisan cooperation in the Senate--my friends here 
have decided to reject everything; anything that might solve the 
problem; anything that might ease the situation at the border; anything 
that might help our Border Patrol agents, anything that will do 
anything to be able to solve this problem they are against.
  It is pathetic that that is the state that we are in right now.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
  Mr. Speaker, the difficulty that we have is that President Biden will 
not use any of the tools he has in his toolbox, and now he is asking 
for additional tools.
  The other problem is codifying 5,000 illegal immigrants a day, 2 
million a year, is not, in anyone's estimation, a solution to a 
problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this is not about Secretary Mayorkas or 
a high crime and misdemeanor. It is about a policy disagreement with 
President Biden.
  Again, it is interesting to point out that when Trump was President, 
he couldn't do things because Congress didn't give him the tools. Biden 
is asking for more tools, and my Republican friends don't want to do 
anything.
  Mr. Speaker, I have a memo here, released today on the arguments 
regarding impeaching Secretary Mayorkas, offered by the chairman of the 
Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, 
Security, and Enforcement, Mr. McClintock.
  In listening to my friends on the other side of the aisle, surely you 
would assume that the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, the 
lead Republican on immigration issues, would conclude in his memo that 
this impeachment is necessary and warranted. But, no, you would be 
wrong.
  In fact, he concludes the exact opposite, and Mr. McClintock has said 
he will vote ``no'' on impeaching the Secretary.
  Now, I would ask unanimous consent to put the entire memo into the 
Record, but it is so exhaustive in its analysis of how this impeachment 
is a bunch of garbage, that the memo exceeds the page limit for the 
Congressional Record.
  Let me just read a quick excerpt instead.
  He writes: ``The problem is that they fail to identify an impeachable 
crime that Mayorkas has committed. In effect, they stretch and distort 
the Constitution in order to hold the administration accountable. . . 
.''
  ``Stretch and distort'': Those are the words of the Republican 
chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague from California, who came to 
the well and basically called it as he sees it. He told the truth.
  We need some more truth around here. This is a sham. This is a 
dangerous precedent to go down.
  To impeach somebody because of a policy disagreement, I tell you, 
this is not what we should be doing. I am hoping that there are 
Republicans on the other side of the aisle who still believe in the 
Constitution and in this institution and who will reject this.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a memo 
prepared by the Secretary of Homeland Security, released on September 
30, 2021, discussing the Secretary being there to enforce the laws.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.

                                               September 30, 2021.

     Subject: Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration 
         Law.
       This memorandum provides guidance for the apprehension and 
     removal of noncitizens.
       I am grateful to you, the other leaders of U.S. Immigration 
     and Customs Enforcement, and our frontline personnel for the 
     candor and openness of the engagements we have had to help 
     shape this guidance. Thank you especially for dedicating 
     yourselves--all your talent and energy--to the noble law 
     enforcement profession. In executing our solemn 
     responsibility to enforce immigration law with honor and 
     integrity, we can help achieve justice and realize our ideals 
     as a Nation. Our colleagues on the front lines and throughout 
     the organization make this possible at great personal 
     sacrifice.


  I. Foundational Principle: The Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion

       It is well established in the law that federal government 
     officials have broad discretion to decide who should be 
     subject to arrest, detainers, removal proceedings, and the 
     execution of removal orders. The exercise of prosecutorial 
     discretion in the immigration arena is a deep-rooted 
     tradition. The United States Supreme Court stated this 
     clearly in 2012:
       ``A principal feature of the removal system is the broad 
     discretion exercised by immigration officials. Federal 
     officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes 
     sense to pursue removal at all.''
       In an opinion by Justice Scalia about twelve years earlier, 
     the Supreme Court emphasized that enforcement discretion 
     extends throughout the entire removal process, and at each 
     stage of it the executive has the discretion to not pursue 
     it.

[[Page H444]]

       It is estimated that there are more than 11 million 
     undocumented or otherwise removable noncitizens in the United 
     States. We do not have the resources to apprehend and seek 
     the removal of every one of these noncitizens. Therefore, we 
     need to exercise our discretion and determine whom to 
     prioritize for immigration enforcement action.
       In exercising our discretion, we are guided by the fact 
     that the majority of undocumented noncitizens who could be 
     subject to removal have been contributing members of our 
     communities for years. They include individuals who work on 
     the frontlines in the battle against COVID, lead our 
     congregations of faith, teach our children, do back-breaking 
     farm work to help deliver food to our table, and contribute 
     in many other meaningful ways. Numerous times over the years, 
     and presently, bipartisan groups of leaders have recognized 
     these noncitizens' contributions to state and local 
     communities and have tried to pass legislation that would 
     provide a path to citizenship or other lawful status for the 
     approximately 11 million undocumented noncitizens.
       The fact an individual is a removable noncitizen therefore 
     should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action 
     against them. We will use our discretion and focus our 
     enforcement resources in a more targeted way. Justice and our 
     country's well-being require it.
       By exercising our discretionary authority in a targeted 
     way, we can focus our efforts on those who pose a threat to 
     national security, public safety, and border security and 
     thus threaten America's well-being. We do not lessen our 
     commitment to enforce immigration law to the best of our 
     ability. This is how we use the resources we have in a way 
     that accomplishes our enforcement mission most effectively 
     and justly.


              II. Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities

       We establish civil immigration enforcement priorities to 
     most effectively achieve our goals with the resources we 
     have. We will prioritize for apprehension and removal 
     noncitizens who are a threat to out national security, public 
     safety, and border security.
     A. Threat to National Security
       A noncitizen who engaged in or is suspected of terrorism or 
     espionage, or terrorism-related or espionage-related 
     activities, or who otherwise poses a danger to national 
     security, is a priority for apprehension and removal.
     B. Threat to Public Safety
       A noncitizen who poses a current threat to public safety, 
     typically because of serious criminal conduct, is a priority 
     for apprehension and removal.
       Whether a noncitizen poses a current threat to public 
     safety is not to be determined according to bright lines or 
     categories. It instead requires an assessment of the 
     individual and the totality of the facts and circumstances.
       There can be aggravating factors that militate in favor of 
     enforcement action. Such factors can include, for example:
       the gravity of the offense of conviction and the sentence 
     imposed;
       the nature and degree of harm caused by the criminal 
     offense;
       the sophistication of the criminal offense;
       use or threatened use of a firearm or dangerous weapon;
       a serious prior criminal record.
       Conversely, there can be mitigating factors that militate 
     in favor of declining enforcement action. Such factors can 
     include, for example:
       advanced or tender age;
       lengthy presence in the United States;
       a mental condition that may have contributed to the 
     criminal conduct, or a physical or mental condition requiring 
     care or treatment;
       status as a victim of crime or victim, witness, or party in 
     legal proceedings;
       the impact of removal on family in the United States, such 
     as loss of provider or caregiver;
       whether the noncitizen may be eligible for humanitarian 
     protection or other immigration relief;
       military or other public service of the noncitizen or their 
     immediate family;
       time since an offense and evidence of rehabilitation;
       conviction was vacated or expunged.
       The above examples of aggravating and mitigating factors 
     are not exhaustive. The circumstances under which an offense 
     was committed could, for example, be an aggravating or 
     mitigating factor depending on the facts. The broader public 
     interest is also material in determining whether to take 
     enforcement action. For example, a categorical determination 
     that a domestic violence offense compels apprehension and 
     removal could make victims of domestic violence more 
     reluctant to report the offense conduct. The specific facts 
     of a case should be determinative.
       Again, our personnel must evaluate the individual and the 
     totality of the facts and circumstances and exercise their 
     judgment accordingly. The overriding question is whether the 
     noncitizen poses a current threat to public safety. Some of 
     the factors relevant to making the determination are 
     identified above.
       The decision how to exercise prosecutorial discretion can 
     be complicated and requires investigative work. Our personnel 
     should not rely on the fact of conviction or the result of a 
     database search alone. Rather, our personnel should, to the 
     fullest extent possible, obtain and review the entire 
     criminal and administrative record and other investigative 
     information to learn of the totality of the facts and 
     circumstances of the conduct at issue. The gravity of an 
     apprehension and removal on a noncitizen's life, and 
     potentially the life of family members and the community, 
     warrants the dedication of investigative and evaluative 
     effort.
     C. Threat to Border Security
       A noncitizen who poses a threat to border security is a 
     priority for apprehension and removal.
       A noncitizen is a threat to border security if:
       (a) they are apprehended at the border or port of entry 
     while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States; or
       (b) they are apprehended in the United States after 
     unlawfully entering after November 1, 2020.
       There could be other border security cases that present 
     compelling facts that warrant enforcement action. In each 
     case, there could be mitigating or extenuating facts and 
     circumstances that militate in favor of declining enforcement 
     action. Our personnel should evaluate the totality of the 
     facts and circumstances and exercise their judgment 
     accordingly.


          III. Protection of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties

       We must exercise our discretionary authority in a way that 
     protects civil rights and civil liberties. The integrity of 
     our work and our Department depend on it. A noncitizen's 
     race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or gender 
     identity, national origin, or political associations shall 
     never be factors in deciding to take enforcement action. A 
     noncitizen's exercise of their First Amendment rights also 
     should never be a factor in deciding to take enforcement 
     action. We must ensure that enforcement actions are not 
     discriminatory and do not lead to inequitable outcomes.
       This guidance does not prohibit consideration of one or 
     more of the above-mentioned factors if they are directly 
     relevant to status under immigration law or eligibility for 
     an immigration benefit. For example, religion or political 
     beliefs are often directly relevant in asylum cases and need 
     to be assessed in determining a case's merit.
       State and local law enforcement agencies with which we work 
     must respect individuals' civil rights and civil liberties as 
     well.


 IV. Guarding Against the Use of Immigration Enforcement as a Tool of 
             Retaliation for the Assertion of Legal Rights

       Our society benefits when individuals--citizens and 
     noncitizens alike--assert their rights by participating in 
     court proceedings or investigations by agencies enforcing our 
     labor, housing, and other laws.
       It is an unfortunate reality that unscrupulous employers 
     exploit their employees' immigration status and vulnerability 
     to removal by, for example, suppressing wages, maintaining 
     unsafe working conditions, and quashing workplace rights and 
     activities. Similarly, unscrupulous landlords exploit their 
     tenants' immigration status and vulnerability to removal by, 
     for example, charging inflated rental costs and failing to 
     comply with housing ordinances and other relevant housing 
     standards.
       We must ensure our immigration enforcement authority is not 
     used as an instrument of these and other unscrupulous 
     practices. A noncitizen's exercise of workplace or tenant 
     rights, or service as a witness in a labor or housing 
     dispute, should be considered a mitigating factor in the 
     exercise of prosecutorial discretion.


   V. The Quality and Integrity of our Civil Immigration Enforcement 
                                Actions

       The civil immigration enforcement guidance does not compel 
     an action to be taken or not taken. Instead, the guidance 
     leaves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to the 
     judgment of our personnel.
       To ensure the quality and integrity of our civil 
     immigration enforcement actions, and to achieve consistency 
     in the application of our judgments, the following measures 
     are to be taken before the effective date of this guidance:
     A. Training
       Extensive training materials and a continuous training 
     program should be put in place to ensure the successful 
     application of this guidance.
     B. Process for Reviewing Effective Implementation
       A review process should be put in place to ensure the 
     rigorous review of our personnel's enforcement decisions 
     throughout the first ninety (90) days of implementation of 
     this guidance. The review process should seek to achieve 
     quality and consistency in decision-making across the entire 
     agency and the Department. It should therefore involve the 
     relevant chains of command.
       Longer-term review processes should be put in place 
     following the initial 90-day period, drawing on the lessons 
     learned. Assessment of implementation of this guidance should 
     be continuous.
     C. Data Collection
       We will need to collect detailed, precise, and 
     comprehensive data as to every aspect of the enforcement 
     actions we take pursuant to this guidance, both to ensure the 
     quality and integrity of our work and to achieve 
     accountability for it.
       Please work with the offices of the Chief Information 
     Officer; Strategy, Policy, and Plans; Science and Technology; 
     Civil Rights

[[Page H445]]

     and Civil Liberties; and Privacy to determine the data that 
     should be collected, the mechanisms to collect it, and how 
     and to what extent it can be made public.
     D. Case Review Process
       We will work to establish a fair and equitable case review 
     process to afford noncitizens and their representatives the 
     opportunity to obtain expeditious review of the enforcement 
     actions taken. Discretion to determine the disposition of the 
     case will remain exclusively with the Department.


                   VI. Implementation of the Guidance

       This guidance will become effective in sixty (60) days, on 
     November 29, 2021. Upon the effective date, this guidance 
     will serve to rescind (1) the January 20, 2021 Interim 
     Revision to Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal 
     Policies and Priorities issued by then-Acting Secretary David 
     Pekoske, and (2) the Interim Guidance: Civil Immigration 
     Enforcement and Removal Priorities issued by Acting ICE 
     Director Tae D. Johnson.
       We will meet regularly to review the data, discuss the 
     results to date, and assess whether we are achieving our 
     goals effectively. Our assessment will be informed by 
     feedback we receive from our law enforcement, community, and 
     other partners.
       This guidance is Department-wide. Agency leaders as to whom 
     this guidance is relevant to their operations will implement 
     this guidance accordingly.


              VII. Statement of No Private Right Conferred

       This guidance is not intended to, does not, and may not be 
     relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or 
     procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any 
     administrative, civil, or criminal matter.

  Mr. BURGESS. In this memo, he basically says he is going to make the 
laws that he then purports to enforce.
  He bemoans the fact that there is no path for citizenship that has 
been established, but then goes on to say: ``The fact an individual is 
a removable noncitizen therefore should not alone be the basis of an 
enforcement action against them.''
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, Michael Chertoff, the former Republican-
appointed Homeland Security Secretary, the first-ever Homeland Security 
Secretary, has also come out in support of Secretary Mayorkas.
  He said: ``I can say with confidence that, for all the investigating 
that the House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have 
failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.''
  He went on to say: ``I don't agree with every policy decision the 
Biden administration has made. There are aspects of immigration 
strategy that are worthy of debate. But House Republicans are ducking 
difficult policy work and hard-fought compromise. Impeachment is a 
diversion from fixing our broken immigration laws and giving DHS the 
resources needed to secure the border.''

                              {time}  1315

  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record an 
opinion piece written by Michael Chertoff and published by the Wall 
Street Journal titled: ``Don't Impeach Alejandro Mayorkas.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.

             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 28, 2024]

                    Don't Impeach Alejandro Mayorkas

 House Republicans are misusing the process to target an official who 
                        has done nothing wrong.

                         (By Michael Chertoff)

       Political and policy disagreements aren't impeachable 
     offenses. The Constitution gives Congress the power to 
     impeach federal officials for treason, bribery and ``other 
     high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That's a high bar. In the 
     history of our republic, only one cabinet secretary has been 
     impeached (for receiving corrupt kickback payments).
       The House Homeland Security Committee is moving toward a 
     Jan. 30 vote on articles of impeachment against Homeland 
     Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, with a possible vote 
     by the full House on Feb. 5. As homeland security secretary 
     under President George W. Bush--and as a former federal 
     judge, U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general--I can 
     say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the 
     House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have 
     failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.
       This is why Republicans aren't seeking to hold Mr. Mayorkas 
     to the Constitution's ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' 
     standard for impeachment. They make the unsupported argument 
     that he is derelict in his duty.
       Since Mr. Mayorkas took office, the majority of migrants 
     encountered at the Southwest border have been removed, 
     returned or expelled. In fact, since the pandemic-era Title 
     42 policy was ended last May, DHS removed, returned or 
     expelled more noncitizens than in any five-month period in 
     the past 10 years. The truth is that our national immigration 
     system is outdated, and DHS leaders under both parties have 
     done their best to manage our immigration system without 
     adequate congressional support.
       I don't agree with every policy decision the Biden 
     administration has made. There are aspects of immigration 
     strategy that are worthy of debate. But House Republicans are 
     ducking difficult policy work and hard-fought compromise. 
     Impeachment is a diversion from fixing our broken immigration 
     laws and giving DHS the resources needed to secure the 
     border.
       Our nation is at its best when our leaders work together to 
     confront the seemingly intractable.
       The situation at our border and our national security, 
     demand such bipartisan collaboration. Despite our different 
     parties, I know Mr. Mayorkas to be fair and honest--dedicated 
     to the safety and security of the U.S. He has represented DHS 
     to the country and to both parties in Congress with 
     integrity. Republicans in the House should drop this 
     impeachment charade and work with Mr. Mayorkas to deliver for 
     the American people.

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record an 
article detailing the number of children that the Department of 
Homeland Security has lost.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.

           [From the Washington Times, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022]

 Rep. Michael Burgess Demands Answers After Illegal Immigrant Children 
                              Go `Missing'

                           (By Stephen Dinan)

       Rep. Michael Burgess warned the Biden administration that 
     it is endangering children and may be breaking the law after 
     many illegal immigrant juveniles have gone `missing' in 
     Houston.
       Mr. Burgess, Texas Republican, said he was alarmed by a 
     Reuters report earlier this month that said roughly 48 
     illegal immigrant children went missing from the Houston 
     homes where the federal Health and Human Services Department 
     had placed them with sponsors. Another nine children ran away 
     from HHS-operated shelters.
       HHS began a frantic effort to track the children. As of 
     late August, 46 of them had been `confirmed safe,' Reuters 
     reported.
       Mr. Burgess, in a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra 
     this week, demanded quick answers on what is going on, saying 
     there were signs the department was putting kids in unsafe 
     situations.
       ``These patterns have been brought to light by the Houston 
     police chief after noticing an increase in missing UACs from 
     the homes of their U.S. sponsors,'' the congressman wrote. 
     ``Of even greater concern, dozens of these children have been 
     released to similar addresses.''
       The Washington Times has reached out to HHS for comment.
       UACs, or Unaccompanied Alien Children, are juveniles who 
     jump the border without a parent.
       Under the law, UACs are to be quickly transferred from 
     Homeland Security's custody to HHS, which places the children 
     in shelters until sponsors can be found.
       Sponsors are often relatives--usually in the country 
     illegally themselves--but can be just about anyone willing to 
     take a child. Some parents will send their children to the 
     border as UACs, with names, addresses and phone numbers for 
     potential sponsors tucked in the children's clothing.
       But there have been horrific abuses.
       The Times reported last month on a case out of Illinois 
     where a 10-year-old girl was placed with a purported aunt who 
     turned out not to be related. The fraudulent aunt now stands 
     accused of terrifying abuses, including stabbing the girl and 
     allowing male members of her household to repeatedly rape the 
     young girl.
       UACs began to surge into the U.S. in 2014, and there have 
     been subsequent waves, but the Biden administration has 
     shattered all previous records with more than a quarter of a 
     million UACs nabbed at the border in just 18 months.
       Overwhelmed by the numbers, the Biden administration tossed 
     some of the safety checks the Trump administration had put in 
     place to try to better vet sponsors.
       In his letter, Mr. Burgess said the fact that the same 
     addresses kept popping up as placement locations in Houston 
     should have been a warning sign about possible exploitation.
       He also questioned whether those placements were even 
     legal.
       ``I am not certain that releasing UACs to non-parent 
     sponsors complies with current law,'' he wrote.

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, that number has increased year over year. 
It was 100,000 kids last year. What are we doing if we are losing track 
of 100,000 children that have come into this country illegally?
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

[[Page H446]]

  

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 4\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record an 
editorial piece from the Wall Street Journal titled: ``Impeaching 
Mayorkas Achieves Nothing.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Massachusetts?
  There was no objection.

             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2024]

                  Impeaching Mayorkas Achieves Nothing


    A policy dispute doesn't qualify as a high crime and misdemeanor

                (By Wall Street Journal Editorial Board)

       House Republicans are marking up articles of impeachment 
     against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and 
     the question is why? As much as we share the frustration with 
     the Biden border mess, impeaching Mr. Mayorkas won't change 
     enforcement policy and is a bad precedent that will open the 
     gates to more cabinet impeachments by both parties.
       The Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday began marking up 
     two articles of impeachment against Mr. Mayorkas--one for 
     breach of trust and the other for ``willful and systemic 
     refusal to comply with the law.'' The articles say these are 
     ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that justify removal from 
     office.
       The 20-page political indictment certainly is a sorry list 
     of policy failings on Mr. Mayorkas's watch and their damaging 
     consequences for American cities and states. These include 
     the entry of migrants on the terrorism watch list, and an 
     increase in average encounters at the border from 590,000 in 
     fiscal years 2017-2020--to 1.4 million in 2021, 2.3 million 
     in 2022 and 2.4 million in 2023.
       These are failures of policy and execution, but are they 
     impeachable offenses? That seems doubtful. The first article 
     cites Mr. Mayorkas for refusing to implement a law that 
     requires detention of aliens. It says his policy of ``catch 
     and release'' is impeachable.
       Yet the Supreme Court has not ruled that the Biden policies 
     are illegal. The High Court in 2022 let the Biden 
     Administration end Donald Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, 
     and last year it ruled 8-1 that states don't necessarily have 
     standing to challenge the federal government's enforcement 
     priorities.
       As for catch and release, one problem is the statutory 
     ``credible fear'' standard for claiming asylum in the U.S. 
     The standard is too low, but it isn't clear under the law 
     that the Administration can legally deport people claiming 
     asylum before they get a hearing. The U.S. lacks the 
     facilities to hold asylum claimants, so they are released to 
     await their hearing--and that can take years. But the problem 
     is asylum law, as Republicans have long argued.
       Article I also claims Mr. Mayorkas has violated the law by 
     expanding humanitarian parole beyond Congress's intent. 
     That's probably true, but the law puts no cap on parole 
     numbers. Texas and other states challenged the President's 
     authority to use parole for large classes of migrants, but 
     the Supreme Court ruled against them.
       House Republicans dislike how the Administration is 
     interpreting immigration law. But Congress has failed to 
     reform asylum standards or humanitarian parole, or to 
     otherwise tighten immigration rules. That's why Senators are 
     now negotiating over language to reform both the asylum 
     standard and parole.
       If Congress holds Mr. Mayorkas impeachable for policy 
     failure, what's the limiting principle? Are his deputies also 
     guilty of ``high crimes'' for implementing the Biden 
     immigration agenda? Career officials? How many GOP cabinet 
     secretaries will the next Democratic House line up to 
     impeach? Policy disputes are for the voting booth, not 
     impeachment.
       All the more so because the main architect of the border-
     security fiasco isn't Mr. Mayorkas. It's his boss, President 
     Biden. ``If you want to flee and you are fleeing oppression, 
     you should come,'' said Candidate Joe Biden in a 2019 debate. 
     Mr. Mayorkas is following White House orders.
       Impeaching Mr. Mayorkas won't have any effect on policy, or 
     even on the politics of border security. Most voters don't 
     know who Mr. Mayorkas is. Even if the House passes the 
     articles, on a largely partisan vote, there is no chance the 
     Democratic Senate will convict him. Impeaching Mr. Mayorkas 
     would be the political equivalent of a no-confidence vote. 
     This would continue Congress's recent trend of defining 
     impeachment down.
       Grandstanding is easier than governing, and Republicans 
     have to decide whether to accomplish anything other than 
     impeaching Democrats. Mr. Mayorkas is an easy political 
     target, but impeaching him accomplishes nothing beyond 
     political symbolism.
       A better idea is to strike a deal with Mr. Biden on serious 
     border-security reforms that would restrict his discretion on 
     parole, rewrite the asylum standard, and give the executive 
     other tools to control the border. If Messrs. Mayorkas and 
     Biden refuse to use them, the GOP will have an election 
     issue. And the tools will be there for the next President to 
     use.

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, everything we have heard from the other 
side has confirmed that this impeachment is a predetermined political 
stunt. Again, this is the first time in American history an impeachment 
could go to the floor of the United States House of Representatives 
with no evidence, no proof, no elements of a crime, nothing at all. Not 
my words, Mr. Speaker. It is your own colleagues who say that.
  Here are a few more quotes. Jonathan Turley, a top Republican legal 
adviser, says: ``There is also no current evidence that he [meaning 
Secretary Mayorkas] is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense.''
  Donald Trump's own impeachment defense lawyer, Alan Dershowitz: ``I 
urge principled Republicans who care about the Constitution to oppose 
those in their party who are seeking to impeach and remove Mayorkas 
based on nonconstitutional accusations.''
  Republican leaders told their donors behind closed doors that they 
were going to impeach Mayorkas before they even began their sham 
investigation. They raise money off of this. They promised Marjorie 
Taylor Greene last year that they were going to impeach, no matter 
what, in order to help Donald Trump, to distract from his legal 
troubles and their own incompetence.
  I get why they need to change the subject. Trump was the worst 
President in my lifetime, probably in history. He tried to overturn the 
election results when he lost. He said he wants to be a dictator ``on 
day one'' and he invokes Adolph Hitler, saying: Immigrants poison the 
blood of our country.
  He had the worst jobs record since the Great Depression. He told 
everyone to drink bleach and take horse medicine during COVID. He has 
been indicted more times than elected and is currently in trial for 91 
felony charges. That is after being ordered to pay $83 million after a 
jury of his peers decided he was a rapist.
  That is the leader of the Republican Party. That is who this 
impeachment is about, Donald Trump; not Secretary Mayorkas, a good, 
honorable, decent man. Donald Trump is a corrupt, dishonorable, 
disgraceful man.
  This is all about helping Republicans rile up MAGA voters and 
distracting from their inability to govern and address the critical 
issues facing our country.
  Instead of legislating, they are being led by Marjorie Taylor Greene 
and the extreme MAGA chock-full-of-nuts caucus to pursue this baseless, 
extreme, and harmful impeachment charade that distracts from actually 
securing the border.
  Do we have a problem at the border? Absolutely. Democrats and 
President Biden want real, comprehensive solutions to fix it, but the 
MAGA extremists have shown no interest in working with House Democrats 
to address the challenges facing the American people.
  What we need is Republicans to stop playing political games. That is 
the exact opposite of what is happening here, the exact opposite of 
this cynical, reckless, impeachment stunt.
  We are going to continue, as Democrats, to put people over politics, 
to fight for issues that matter, to try to lower costs, grow our 
economy, and, yes, to secure our border.
  If Republicans decide they want to join us as partners in government 
to solve these challenges, we welcome that. If they don't, there is an 
election coming up in November.
  I would say history is going to judge this Republican majority, but I 
don't think we need to wait for that. The voters are going to judge us 
all in November, and I think people are going to look at this 
fraudulent impeachment and they are going to look at Republicans' lack 
of accomplishments and they are going to vote them out because of their 
incompetence, their extremism, and their refusal to work with Democrats 
to address the challenges our country faces, including the border.
  As I said before, this entire impeachment stunt is an absurd, cynical 
exercise in extremism. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this rule and a 
``no'' vote on the underlying resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining.

[[Page H447]]

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I think we have seen one of the worst cases of Trump 
derangement syndrome ever recorded.
  I would just remind people that I am not running for reelection, so I 
am not beholden to anyone. As I told the gentleman last week, I am 
bulletproof. I am only beholden to the constituents I represent. And 
the constituents I represent do not understand why Texas has had to 
endure basically an invasion during the tenure of this Secretary of 
Homeland Security, why he has not enforced the laws that he swore an 
oath to uphold and enforce. He won't do it.
  What are we left to do when we have someone who is charged with 
protecting our country, charged with enforcing our laws, and he says it 
is too much trouble, I can't do it?
  We know it is possible, because I was on a codel with Speaker Johnson 
down to the border down at Eagle Pass not but a couple weeks ago. The 
week before, we had seen on Bill Melugin's report on FOX News thousands 
of people on the riverbanks on the United States side who were there 
awaiting processing to be released into our country to parts unknown, 
for lengths of time unknown. When the Speaker of the House goes down 
there, there is not a soul on that riverbank.
  This problem can be stopped literally overnight, if the Secretary and 
the President would make it a priority and would do it, but they won't. 
What are we left to do?
  I agree with the gentleman that there is an election coming up. I 
hope people do remember that. I hope they do remember they have a 
President who, under 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, has 
it in his power right now to suspend activities on the southern border, 
but he won't do it.

  We are being invaded, Mr. Speaker. My Governor, Governor Abbott, has 
officially declared an invasion. I don't think there is any debate 
about that. The administration and this Secretary have done nothing to 
help Texas. Instead, they have turned around and sued the State at 
every turn. Mr. Speaker, $12 billion dollars is what Texas has had to 
spend over the last year to do the job that Secretary Mayorkas should 
have been doing.
  Just by the numbers, over 2 million illegal aliens apprehended last 
fiscal year, 15,000 pounds of fentanyl seized from drug smugglers 
crossing our border. How many families need to lose a child? How many 
American lives have to be cut short before Secretary Mayorkas, 
President Biden, and his border czar, Vice President Kamala Harris, 
change course and actually enforce existing law?
  The consequences of this administration and Secretary Mayorkas' 
actions have been staggering: A southern border open to drug cartels, 
criminals, human traffickers, and potential terrorists; a record number 
of migrant deaths; rising human trafficking; exploitation of minors; a 
growing public health disaster; and an annual net burden to the 
American taxpayer exceeding $150 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, each of these consequences would have been avoidable if 
Secretary Mayorkas had just enforced existing law. This willful and 
systemic refusal to comply with the law and the continued breach of 
public trust by Secretary Mayorkas will not be tolerated. For this, he 
must be impeached.
  I also thank Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers for her leadership in 
bringing H.R. 485 to the floor and Chairman Mark Green of the Homeland 
Security Committee for his work on a proper and thorough investigation 
leading to consideration of H. Res. 863.
  Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of the rule and the 
underlying legislation.
  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:

  An Amendment to H. Res. 996 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts

       At the end of the resolution, add the following:
       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the 
     House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the 
     bill (H.R. 12) to protect a person's ability to determine 
     whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a 
     health care provider's ability to provide abortion services. 
     All points of order against consideration of the bill are 
     waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of 
     order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous 
     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
     any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening 
     motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and 
     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on Energy and Commerce or their respective 
     designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.
       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the 
     consideration of H.R. 12.

  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Van Duyne). The question is on ordering 
the previous question.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question are postponed.

IMPEACHING ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, 
                    FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 
996, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 863) impeaching Alejandro 
Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, for high crimes and 
misdemeanors, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 863

       Resolved, That Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of 
     Homeland Security of the United States of America, is 
     impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the 
     following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United 
     States Senate:
        Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
     Representatives of the United States of America in the name 
     of itself and of the people of the United States of America, 
     against Alejandro N. Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security 
     of the United States of America, in maintenance and support 
     of its impeachment against him for high crimes and 
     misdemeanors.


    article i: willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law 

       The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives 
     ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that civil 
     Officers of the United States, including the Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, ``shall be removed from Office on 
     Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
     other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''. In his conduct while 
     Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, in 
     violation of his oath to support and defend the Constitution 
     of the United States against all enemies, foreign and 
     domestic, to bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and 
     to well and faithfully discharge the duties of his office, 
     has willfully and systemically refused to comply with Federal 
     immigration laws, in that:
       Throughout his tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security, 
     Alejandro N. Mayorkas has repeatedly violated laws enacted by 
     Congress regarding immigration and border security. In large 
     part because of his unlawful conduct, millions of aliens have 
     illegally entered the United States on an annual basis with 
     many unlawfully remaining in the United States. His refusal 
     to obey the law is not only an offense against the separation 
     of powers in the Constitution of the United States, it also 
     threatens our national security and has had a dire impact on 
     communities across the country. Despite clear evidence that 
     his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law has 
     significantly contributed to unprecedented levels of illegal 
     entrants, the increased control of the Southwest border by 
     drug cartels, and the imposition of enormous costs on States 
     and localities affected by the influx of aliens, Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas has continued in his refusal to comply with the law, 
     and thereby acted to the grave detriment of the interests of 
     the United States.
       Alejandro N. Mayorkas engaged in this scheme or course of 
     conduct through the following means:
       (1) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully refused to comply with 
     the detention mandate set forth in section 235(b)(2)(A) of 
     the Immigration and Nationality Act, requiring that all 
     applicants for admission who are ``not clearly and beyond a 
     doubt entitled to be admitted...shall be detained for a 
     [removal] proceeding...''. Instead of complying with this 
     requirement, Alejandro N. Mayorkas implemented a catch and 
     release scheme, whereby such aliens are unlawfully released, 
     even without effective mechanisms to ensure appearances 
     before the immigration courts for removal proceedings or to 
     ensure removal in the case of aliens ordered removed.
       (2) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully refused to comply with 
     the detention mandate set forth in section 235(b)(1)(B)(ii) 
     of such Act, requiring that an alien who is placed into 
     expedited removal proceedings and determined to have a 
     credible fear of persecution ``shall be detained for further 
     consideration of the application for asylum''. Instead of 
     complying with this requirement, Alejandro N. Mayorkas 
     implemented a catch and release scheme, whereby such aliens 
     are unlawfully released, even without effective mechanisms to 
     ensure appearances before the immigration courts for removal 
     proceedings or to ensure removal in the case of aliens 
     ordered removed.
       (3) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully refused to comply with 
     the detention set forth in section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) of 
     such Act, requiring that an alien who is placed into 
     expedited removal proceedings and determined not to have a 
     credible fear of persecution ``shall be detained...until 
     removed''. Instead of complying with this requirement, 
     Alejandro N. Mayorkas has implemented a catch and release 
     scheme, whereby such aliens are unlawfully released, even 
     without effective mechanisms to ensure appearances before the 
     immigration courts for removal proceedings or to ensure 
     removal in the case of aliens ordered removed.
       (4) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully refused to comply with 
     the detention mandate set forth in section 236(c) of such 
     Act, requiring that a criminal alien who is inadmissible or 
     deportable on certain criminal and terrorism-related grounds 
     ``shall [be] take[n] into custody'' when the alien is 
     released from law enforcement custody. Instead of complying 
     with this requirement, Alejandro N. Mayorkas issued 
     ``Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Laws'', 
     which instructs Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter 
     referred to as ``DHS'') officials that the ``fact an 
     individual is a removable noncitizen...should not alone be 
     the basis of an enforcement action against them'' and that 
     DHS ``personnel should not rely on the fact of 
     conviction...alone'', even with respect to aliens subject to 
     mandatory arrest and detention pursuant to section 236(c) of 
     such Act, to take them into custody. In Texas v. United 
     States, 40 F.4th 205 (2022), the United States Court of 
     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that these guidelines 
     had ``every indication of being `a general policy that is so 
     extreme as to amount to an abdication of...statutory 
     responsibilities' '' and that its ``replacement of Congress's 
     statutory mandates with concerns of equity and race is 
     extralegal...[and] plainly outside the bounds of the power 
     conferred by the INA''.
       (5) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully refused to comply with 
     the detention mandate set forth in section 241(a)(2) of such 
     Act, requiring that an alien ordered removed ``shall [be] 
     detain[ed]'' during ``the removal period''. Instead of 
     complying with this mandate, Alejandro N. Mayorkas issued 
     ``Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Laws'', 
     which instructs DHS officials that the ``fact an individual 
     is a removable noncitizen...should not alone be the basis of 
     an enforcement action against them'' and that DHS ``personnel 
     should not rely on the fact of conviction...alone'', even 
     with respect to aliens subject to mandatory detention and 
     removal pursuant to section 241(a) of such Act.
       (6) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully exceeded his parole 
     authority set forth in section 212(d)(5)(A) of such Act that 
     permits parole to be granted ``only on a case-by-case 
     basis'', temporarily, and ``for urgent humanitarian reasons 
     or significant public benefit'', in that:
       (A) Alejandro N. Mayorkas paroled aliens en masse in order 
     to release them from mandatory detention, despite the fact 
     that, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
     Circuit concluded in Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928 (2021), 
     ``parol[ing] every alien [DHS] cannot detain is the opposite 
     of the `case-by-case basis' determinations required by law'' 
     and ``DHS's pretended power to parole aliens while ignoring 
     the limitations Congress imposed on the parole power [is] not 
     nonenforcement; it's misenforcement, suspension of the INA, 
     or both''.
       (B) Alejandro N. Mayorkas created, re-opened, or expanded a 
     series of categorical parole programs never authorized by 
     Congress for foreign nationals outside of the United States, 
     including for certain Central American minors, Ukrainians, 
     Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, 
     Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans, which enabled 
     hundreds of thousands of inadmissible aliens to enter the 
     United States in violation of the laws enacted by Congress.
       (7) Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully exceeded his release 
     authority set forth in section 236(a) of such Act that 
     permits, in certain circumstances, the release of aliens 
     arrested on an administrative warrant, in that Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas released aliens arrested without a warrant despite 
     their being subject to a separate applicable mandatory 
     detention requirement set forth in section 235(b)(2) of such 
     Act. Alejandro N. Mayorkas released such aliens by 
     retroactively issuing administrative warrants in an attempt 
     to circumvent section 235(b)(2) of such Act. In Florida v. 
     United States, No. 3:21-cv-

[[Page H450]]

     1066-TKW-ZCB (N.D. Fla. Mar. 8, 2023), the United States 
     District Court of the Northern District of Florida noted that 
     ``[t]his sleight of hand - using an `arrest' warrant as a de 
     facto `release' warrant - is administrative sophistry at its 
     worst''. In addition, the court concluded that ``what makes 
     DHS's application of [236(a)] in this manner unlawful...is 
     that [235(b)(2)], not [236(a)], governs the detention of 
     applicants for admission whom DHS places in...removal 
     proceedings after inspection''.
       Alejandro N. Mayorkas's willful and systemic refusal to 
     comply with the law has had calamitous consequences for the 
     Nation and the people of the United States, including:
       (1) During fiscal years 2017 through 2020, an average of 
     about 590,000 aliens each fiscal year were encountered as 
     inadmissible aliens at ports of entry on the Southwest border 
     or apprehended between ports of entry. Thereafter, during 
     Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure in office, that number 
     skyrocketed to over 1,400,000 in fiscal year 2021, over 
     2,300,000 in fiscal year 2022, and over 2,400,000 in fiscal 
     year 2023. Similarly, during fiscal years 2017 through 2020, 
     an average of 130,000 persons who were not turned back or 
     apprehended after making an illegal entry were observed along 
     the border each fiscal year. During Alejandro N. Mayorkas's 
     tenure in office, that number more than trebled to 400,000 in 
     fiscal year 2021, 600,000 in fiscal year 2022, and 750,000 in 
     fiscal year 2023.
       (2) American communities both along the Southwest border 
     and across the United States have been devastated by the 
     dramatic growth in illegal entries, the number of aliens 
     unlawfully present, and substantial rise in the number of 
     aliens unlawfully granted parole, creating a fiscal and 
     humanitarian crisis and dramatically degrading the quality of 
     life of the residents of those communities. For instance, 
     since 2022, more than 150,000 migrants have gone through New 
     York City's shelter intake system. Indeed, the Mayor of New 
     York City has said that ``we are past our breaking point'' 
     and that ``[t]his issue will destroy New York City''. In 
     fiscal year 2023, New York City spent $1,450,000,000 
     addressing Alejandro N. Mayorkas's migrant crisis, and city 
     officials fear it will spend another $12,000,000,000 over the 
     following three fiscal years, causing painful budget cuts to 
     important city services.
       (3) Alejandro N. Mayorkas's unlawful mass release of 
     apprehended aliens and unlawful mass grant of categorical 
     parole to aliens have enticed an increasing number of aliens 
     to make the dangerous journey to our Southwest border. 
     Consequently, according to the United Nations's International 
     Organization for Migration, the number of migrants intending 
     to illegally cross our border who have perished along the 
     way, either en route to the United States or at the border, 
     almost doubled during the tenure of Alejandro N. Mayorkas as 
     Secretary of Homeland Security, from an average of about 700 
     a year during the fiscal years 2017 through 2020, to an 
     average of about 1,300 a year during the fiscal years 2021 
     through 2023.
       (4) Alien smuggling organizations have gained tremendous 
     wealth during Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure as Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, with their estimated revenues rising from 
     about $500,000,000 in 2018 to approximately $13,000,000,000 
     in 2022.
       (5) During Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure as Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, the immigration court backlog has more 
     than doubled from about 1,300,000 cases to over 3,000,000 
     cases. The exploding backlog is destroying the courts' 
     ability to administer justice and provide appropriate relief 
     in a timeframe that does not run into years or even decades. 
     As Alejandro N. Mayorkas acknowledged, ``those who have a 
     valid claim to asylum...often wait years for a...decision; 
     likewise, noncitizens who will ultimately be found ineligible 
     for asylum or other protection--which occurs in the majority 
     of cases--often have spent many years in the United States 
     prior to being ordered removed''. He noted that of aliens 
     placed in expedited removal proceedings and found to have a 
     credible fear of persecution, and thus referred to 
     immigration judges for removal proceedings, ``significantly 
     fewer than 20 percent...were ultimately granted asylum'' and 
     only ``28 percent of cases decided on their merits are grants 
     of relief''. Alejandro N. Mayorkas also admitted that ``the 
     fact that migrants can wait in the United States for years 
     before being issued a final order denying relief, and that 
     many such individuals are never actually removed, likely 
     incentivizes migrants to make the journey north''.
       (6) During Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure as Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, approximately 450,000 unaccompanied alien 
     children have been encountered at the Southwest border, and 
     the vast majority have been released into the United States. 
     As a result, there has been a dramatic upsurge in migrant 
     children being employed in dangerous and exploitative jobs in 
     the United States.
       (7) Alejandro N. Mayorkas's failure to enforce the law, 
     drawing millions of illegal aliens to the Southwest border, 
     has led to the reassignment of U.S. Border Patrol agents from 
     protecting the border from illicit drug trafficking to 
     processing illegal aliens for release. As a result, during 
     Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure as Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, the flow of fentanyl across the border and other 
     dangerous drugs, both at and between ports of entry, has 
     increased dramatically. U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
     seized approximately 4,800 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 
     2020, approximately 11,200 pounds in fiscal year 2021, 
     approximately 14,700 pounds in fiscal year 2022, and 
     approximately 27,000 pounds in fiscal year 2023. Over 70,000 
     Americans died from fentanyl poisoning in 2022, and fentanyl 
     is now the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 
     18 and 45.
       (8) Alejandro N. Mayorkas has degraded public safety by 
     leaving wide swaths of the border effectively unpatrolled as 
     U.S. Border Patrol agents are diverted from guarding the 
     border to processing for unlawful release the heightening 
     waves of apprehended aliens (many who now seek out agents for 
     the purpose of surrendering with the now reasonable 
     expectation of being released and granted work 
     authorization), and Federal Air Marshals are diverted from 
     protecting the flying public to assist in such processing.
       (9) During Alejandro N. Mayorkas's tenure as Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, the U.S. Border Patrol has encountered an 
     increasing number of aliens on the terrorist watch list. In 
     fiscal years 2017 through 2020 combined, 11 noncitizens on 
     the terrorist watchlist were caught attempting to cross the 
     Southwest border between ports of entry. That number 
     increased to 15 in fiscal year 2021, 98 in fiscal year 2022, 
     169 in fiscal year 2023, and 49 so far in fiscal year 2024.
       Additionally, in United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 
     (2023), the United States Supreme Court heard a case 
     involving Alejandro N. Mayorkas's refusal to comply with 
     certain Federal immigration laws that are at issue in this 
     impeachment. The Supreme Court held that States have no 
     standing to seek judicial relief to compel Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas to comply with certain legal requirements contained 
     in the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, the Supreme 
     Court held that ``even though the federal courts lack Article 
     III jurisdiction over this suit, other forums remain open for 
     examining the Executive Branch's enforcement policies. For 
     example, Congress possesses an array of tools to analyze and 
     influence those policies [and] those are political checks for 
     the political process''. One such critical tool for Congress 
     to influence the Executive Branch to comply with the 
     immigration laws of the United States is impeachment. The 
     dissenting Justice noted, ``The Court holds Texas lacks 
     standing to challenge a federal policy that inflicts 
     substantial harm on the State and its residents by releasing 
     illegal aliens with criminal convictions for serious crimes. 
     In order to reach this conclusion, the Court...holds that the 
     only limit on the power of a President to disobey a law like 
     the important provision at issue is Congress' power to employ 
     the weapons of inter-branch warfare...''. As the dissenting 
     Justice explained, ``Congress may wield what the Solicitor 
     General described as `political...tools'--which presumably 
     means such things as...impeachment and removal''. Indeed, 
     during oral argument, the Justice who authored the majority 
     opinion stated to the Solicitor General, ``I think your 
     position is, instead of judicial review, Congress has to 
     resort to shutting down the government or impeachment or 
     dramatic steps...''. Here, in light of the inability of 
     injured parties to seek judicial relief to remedy the refusal 
     of Alejandro N. Mayorkas to comply with Federal immigration 
     laws, impeachment is Congress's only viable option.
       In all of this, Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully and 
     systemically refused to comply with the immigration laws, 
     failed to control the border to the detriment of national 
     security, compromised public safety, and violated the rule of 
     law and separation of powers in the Constitution, to the 
     manifest injury of the people of the United States.
       Wherefore Alejandro N. Mayorkas, by such conduct, has 
     demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national and 
     border security, the safety of the United States people, and 
     the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has 
     acted in a manner grossly incompatible with his duties and 
     the rule of law. Alejandro N. Mayorkas thus warrants 
     impeachment and trial, removal from office, and 
     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
     trust, or profit under the United States.


                  article ii: breach of public trust 

       The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives 
     ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that civil 
     Officers of the United States, including the Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, ``shall be removed from Office on 
     Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
     other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''. In his conduct while 
     Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, in 
     violation of his oath to well and faithfully discharge the 
     duties of his office, has breached the public trust, in that:
       Alejandro N. Mayorkas has knowingly made false statements, 
     and knowingly obstructed lawful oversight of the Department 
     of Homeland Security (hereinafter referred to as ``DHS''), 
     principally to obfuscate the results of his willful and 
     systemic refusal to comply with the law. Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas engaged in this scheme or course of conduct through 
     the following means:
       (1) Alejandro N. Mayorkas knowingly made false statements 
     to Congress that the border is ``secure'', that the border is 
     ``no less secure than it was previously'', that the border is 
     ``closed'', and that DHS has ``operational control'' of the 
     border (as that term is defined in the Secure Fence Act of 
     2006).
       (2) Alejandro N. Mayorkas knowingly made false statements 
     to Congress regarding the scope and adequacy of the vetting 
     of the thousands of Afghans who were airlifted to the United 
     States and then granted parole following the Taliban takeover 
     of Afghanistan after President Biden's precipitous withdrawal 
     of United States forces.
       (3) Alejandro N. Mayorkas knowingly made false statements 
     that apprehended aliens with no legal basis to remain in the 
     United States were being quickly removed.
       (4) Alejandro N. Mayorkas knowingly made false statements 
     supporting the false narrative that U.S. Border Patrol agents 
     maliciously whipped illegal aliens.
       (5) Alejandro N. Mayorkas failed to comply with multiple 
     subpoenas issued by congressional committees.
       (6) Alejandro N. Mayorkas delayed or denied access of DHS 
     Office of Inspector General (hereinafter referred to as 
     ``OIG'') to DHS records

[[Page H451]]

     and information, hampering OIG's ability to effectively 
     perform its vital investigations, audits, inspections, and 
     other reviews of agency programs and operations to satisfy 
     the OIG's obligations under section 402(b) of title 5, United 
     States Code, in part, to Congress.
       Additionally, in his conduct while Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas has breached the public trust 
     by his willful refusal to fulfill his statutory ``duty to 
     control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United 
     States against the illegal entry of aliens'' as set forth in 
     section 103(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
     Alejandro N. Mayorkas inherited what his first Chief of the 
     U.S. Border Patrol called, ``arguably the most effective 
     border security in our nation's history''. Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas, however, proceeded to abandon effective border 
     security initiatives without engaging in adequate alternative 
     efforts that would enable DHS to maintain control of the 
     border and guard against illegal entry, and despite clear 
     evidence of the devastating consequences of his actions, he 
     failed to take action to fulfill his statutory duty to 
     control the border. According to his first Chief of the U.S. 
     Border Patrol, Alejandro N. Mayorkas ``summarily rejected'' 
     the ``multiple options to reduce the illegal 
     entries...through proven programs and consequences'' provided 
     by civil service staff at DHS. Despite clear evidence of the 
     devastating consequences of his actions, he failed to take 
     action to fulfill his statutory duty to control the border, 
     in that, among other things:
       (1) Alejandro N. Mayorkas terminated the Migrant Protection 
     Protocols (hereinafter referred to as ``MPP''). In Texas v. 
     Biden, 20 F.4th 928 (2021), the United States Court of 
     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained that ``[t]he district 
     court...pointed to evidence that `the termination of MPP has 
     contributed to the current border surge'...(citing DHS's own 
     previous determinations that MPP had curbed the rate of 
     illegal entries)''. The district court had also ``pointed out 
     that the number of `enforcement encounters'--that is, 
     instances where immigration officials encounter immigrants 
     attempting to cross the southern border without 
     documentation--had `skyrocketed' since MPP's termination''.
       (2) Alejandro N. Mayorkas terminated contracts for border 
     wall construction.
       (3) Alejandro N. Mayorkas terminated asylum cooperative 
     agreements that would have equitably shared the burden of 
     complying with international asylum accords.
       In all of this, Alejandro N. Mayorkas breached the public 
     trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and 
     the American people and avoiding lawful oversight in order to 
     obscure the devastating consequences of his willful and 
     systemic refusal to comply with the law and carry out his 
     statutory duties. He has also breached the public trust by 
     willfully refusing to carry out his statutory duty to control 
     the border and guard against illegal entry, notwithstanding 
     the calamitous consequences of his abdication of that duty.
       Wherefore Alejandro N. Mayorkas, by such conduct, has 
     demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national and 
     border security, the safety of the American people, and to 
     the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has 
     acted in a manner grossly incompatible with his duties and 
     the rule of law. Alejandro N. Mayorkas thus warrants 
     impeachment and trial, removal from office, and 
     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
     trust, or profit under the United States.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Malliotakis). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 996, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended 
by the Committee on Homeland Security is adopted.
  The resolution shall be debatable for 2 hours equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security or their respective designees.
  The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) and the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.

                              {time}  1445


                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 863.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today to present two Articles of Impeachment 
against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  Article I charges him with willful and systemic refusal to comply 
with the law, and Article II charges him with breach of public trust.
  Since Secretary Mayorkas took office, we have all watched the 
unprecedented crisis at our borders unfold. We have seen the chaos.
  Under Secretary Mayorkas' watch, CBP has reported more than 8.5 
million encounters at our borders, including more than 7 million 
apprehensions at the southwest border. Even more terrifying is the 
approximate 1.8 million known got-aways that Border Patrol agents 
detect but are unable to apprehend.
  Millions of those inadmissible aliens who are encountered are 
eventually released into our communities. This has never happened 
before in the history of the country, and it doesn't happen by 
accident.
  For nearly a year, the House Committee on Homeland Security conducted 
a thorough, fair, and comprehensive investigation into the causes, 
costs, and consequences of the border crisis. Our Members saw firsthand 
numerous parts of the southwest border, spent time with law enforcement 
officers on the front lines, and spoke with real Americans about how 
the crisis is affecting them.
  We also conducted a field hearing and roundtable on the border that 
our Democrat colleagues refused to attend, burying their heads in the 
sand as if there wasn't a crisis. We published seven total reports, 
totaling nearly 400 pages, to which Democrats never had a single 
substantive response.
  Instead, their only response was to simply shout MAGA louder and 
louder, as if that is a meaningful response to the millions of 
Americans suffering from this crisis.
  We held many hearings at the subcommittee and full committee level, 
and we heard from a variety of witnesses, including former senior DHS 
enforcement officials, State attorneys general, and victims who have 
been impacted by Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis. Democrats 
consistently claimed these hearings were a waste of time. Tell that to 
the families of the 150,000 Americans who died from fentanyl poisoning 
in 2021 and 2022 alone.
  Throughout this investigation and subsequent impeachment proceedings, 
we found that Secretary Mayorkas' willful and systemic refusal to 
comply with the law and his breach of public trust are responsible for 
this historic crisis. However, for almost a year, Democrats have turned 
a blind eye to the victims of the border crisis while berating us for 
spending what they believed was too much time investigating Secretary 
Mayorkas' lawless handling of our sovereign borders.
  Keep that in mind when you hear them claim now this impeachment is 
somehow rushed. The truth is this process has been painstakingly 
thorough. Unlike House Democrats, we take the use of impeachment 
extremely seriously.
  While I do not wish to be standing here presenting these Articles of 
Impeachment today, we have exhausted all other options. Our oath to the 
Constitution now requires us to exercise this solemn duty.
  Secretary Mayorkas has explicitly refused to comply with the law. His 
refusal to obey the law has led to the death of our fellow citizens, 
and he no longer deserves to keep his job.
  What is unique here in the history of impeachments is that the 
Supreme Court, just this summer, denied the affected States judicial 
review on many of these issues, but with the understanding that the 
result of doing so could mean the impeachment of a Secretary.
  In oral argument, Justice Kavanaugh explained how he understood the 
position of the Biden administration if judicial review was denied, 
saying: ``I think your position is, instead of judicial review, 
Congress has to resort to shutting down the government or impeachment 
or dramatic steps if . . . some administration comes in and says we're 
not going to enforce laws or at least not going to enforce the laws to 
the degree that Congress by law has said the laws should be enforced . 
. . `'
  In response, the Biden administration's solicitor general agreed, 
saying: ``Well, I think that if those dramatic steps would be 
warranted, it would be in the face of a dramatic abdication of 
statutory responsibility by the executive.''

[[Page H452]]

  Today's Articles of Impeachment outline exactly that; a dramatic 
abdication of statutory responsibility by Secretary Mayorkas has 
occurred.
  Of the Articles of Impeachment's 20 pages, 6 are solely dedicated to 
the laws Secretary Mayorkas has violated, while 4 more document his 
lies to Congress and the American people and the violation of his 
statutory duty to control and guard our borders.
  We identify numerous unambiguous provisions of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act he has refused to enforce, laws requiring him to detain 
inadmissible aliens and limit his ability to grant parole. We also 
highlight how programs he has created, such as various mass parole 
programs, are void of congressional authority.
  Secretary Mayorkas is the very type of public official the Framers 
feared: someone who would cast aside the laws passed by a coequal 
branch of government and replace those with his own preferences, 
hurting his fellow Americans in the process.
  He has directed the release of millions of inadmissible aliens into 
the country in violation of the INA, which requires them to be 
detained.
  He has abused the statute limiting parole to be issued only on a 
case-by-case and temporary basis for very specific and limited 
reasons--instead overseeing more than 1.5 million paroles.

  He has created new categorical parole programs in defiance of the 
statute to further his mass release agenda, and he has directed 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel not to detain all manner 
of illegal aliens, including criminal aliens. In his September 2021 
enforcement guidance, the Secretary even directed that unlawful 
presence in the country was no longer sufficient grounds for removal 
and that criminal convictions alone were not enough to warrant ICE 
attention.

       This is not about policy differences. We certainly object 
     to Secretary Mayorkas' policies, but this goes far deeper. 
     According to the Democrat-led committees that investigated 
     Iran-Contra: ``Government officials must observe the law, 
     even when they disagree with it,'' or when they think that, 
     ``Congress is to blame for passing laws that run counter to 
     administration policy.''

  Again, we are here because our oath and our duty compel us to be 
here. The actions and decisions of Secretary Mayorkas have left us with 
no other option than to proceed with Articles of Impeachment. That is 
why we must remove him from office. The time for accountability is now.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 863 and the 
Republicans' sham impeachment of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  Madam Speaker, what is happening here today is a travesty. It is an 
affront to the United States Constitution, it will do nothing to solve 
challenges at our border, and it is a baseless attack on a dedicated 
public servant.
  Republican Members of Congress, sworn to support and defend the 
Constitution, are rejecting the Framers' intent and over two centuries 
of precedent in favor of a politically motivated sham impeachment. 
Republicans have failed to make a constitutionally viable case for 
impeachment.
  Neither of the impeachment charges in H. Res. 863 are a high crime 
and misdemeanor under Article II of the Constitution. Impeachment over 
mere policy disputes was deliberately rejected by the Framers, and 
those disputes are best settled in our court system.
  In fact, the policy disputes identified in the Articles of 
Impeachment have already been addressed by the courts. The courts have 
either decided in the Biden administration's favor, or the disputes are 
still working their way through the system.
  Republicans are trying to relitigate court decisions through a sham 
impeachment, but the Constitution doesn't allow that.
  Constitutional experts testified before the Committee on Homeland 
Security that, for a breach of public trust to rise to a high crime and 
misdemeanor, it would require conduct intended to serve an official's 
own benefit or the benefit of a foreign power.
  Secretary Mayorkas has done nothing of the sort.
  Republicans have misrepresented the law and Secretary Mayorkas' 
record to justify this sham impeachment.
  Secretary Mayorkas has served our country honorably over 30 years as 
a prosecutor and in leadership roles at the Department of Homeland 
Security. He has been a tireless advocate for the more than 260,000 DHS 
employees working to secure the homeland every day. He has leveraged 
all the authorities at his disposal while using every resource provided 
by Congress to secure the border.
  Under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, DHS removed record levels of 
migrants from the U.S., detained even more people than Congress had 
provided funding for, and prevented record levels of fentanyl from 
entering our communities.
  If House Republicans were serious about improving conditions along 
the border, they would provide the Department the funding necessary to 
do so. They have not. At every opportunity, Republicans have refused to 
provide resources to the Department of Homeland Security.
  If House Republicans were serious about improving conditions at the 
border, they would support the bipartisan Senate border bill. They have 
not.
  Republicans take their orders from Donald Trump, and he told them to 
reject the Senate bill. Republicans have been trying to kill the bill 
before they even knew what was in it.
  The Republican majority is running a do-nothing Congress.
  This sham impeachment effort isn't really about border security. It 
will do nothing to solve the border challenges we face. The truth is 
the extreme MAGA Republicans running the House of Representatives don't 
want solutions; they want a political issue.
  House Republicans want to distort the Constitution and the 
Secretary's record to cover up their inability and unwillingness to 
work with Democrats to strengthen border security. It is about 
Republican politics and subversion of the Constitution.
  Bipartisan constitutional law and impeachment experts agree the 
Secretary has not committed an impeachable offense. Former Secretary of 
Homeland Security Michael Chertoff agrees, and even some of my 
Republican colleagues here in the House agree.
  The gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) said in a memorandum 
to House Republican colleagues:

       The problem is that [the impeachment articles] fail to 
     identify an impeachable crime.

  The gentleman from California is right. I suspect some of his 
Republican colleagues agree, even if they won't admit it.
  Secretary Mayorkas has faithfully implemented the administration's 
border policies consistent with the funding Congress has provided, just 
like every other Secretary of Homeland Security before him, Democrat or 
Republican.
  During consideration in the Homeland Security Committee last week, 
Republicans improperly shut down the markup and blocked Democrats from 
offering amendments to the resolution.

  Republicans couldn't bear to consider amendments to their poorly 
drafted Articles of Impeachment. They silenced Democrats who attempted 
to inject a dose of reality into the chaotic proceedings.
  Yesterday, before the Rules Committee, Republicans again failed to 
make their case, relying on partisan rhetoric and obvious 
misinformation, because neither the law, nor the facts are on their 
side.
  The truth is Republicans' actions show they don't have faith in their 
own case against the Secretary. That is why they lack the courage of 
their convictions to see their markup to the end.
  This nonsense has to stop, and it should stop here. Republicans need 
to start doing the work Americans sent them here to do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to honor their oath to the 
Constitution, listen to the constitutional experts, listen to your own 
Republican colleagues who know H. Res. 863 is baseless. Drop this sham 
impeachment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene).
  Ms. GREENE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.

[[Page H453]]

  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 863, impeaching 
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  Alejandro Mayorkas is guilty of aiding and abetting the complete 
invasion of our country by criminals, gang members, terrorists, 
murderers, rapists, and over 10 million people from over 160 countries 
into American communities all across the United States.
  His willful refusal to secure the border has bankrupted communities, 
closed down U.S. schools that our children attend, drowned hospitals, 
and incapacitated law enforcement, while empowering criminal cartels 
and illegal aliens.
  My Democrat colleagues argue that one cannot be impeached over policy 
differences. Well, I argue that breaking our laws is more than just 
policy differences. Mr. Speaker, 300 dead Americans every day from 
fentanyl poisoning is more than just a policy difference; it is murder.
  Today, in my own office, narcotics law enforcement officers from 
Georgia told me that 7 out of 10 doses of Oxycontin or Percocet sold on 
the street are laced with fentanyl, and that comes directly across the 
border from Mexico.
  Secretary Mayorkas has violated numerous provisions in the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, including unlawfully directing DHS to 
mass-parole illegal aliens into the U.S. when Federal law specifically 
prohibits this, and unlawfully implementing catch and release policies 
when Federal law specifically mandates the detention and removal of 
inadmissible aliens.
  In fact, detention facilities under Mayorkas have been mostly vacant 
because of such unlawful policies. The largest detention facility in 
California, which can house almost 2,000 illegals, is currently housing 
only 6 illegal aliens. He has violated his oath of office and breached 
the public trust by willfully refusing to ensure the laws passed by 
Congress and signed into law by the President are faithfully executed 
as required by Article II of the Constitution.
  He has allowed over 10 million illegal border crossers to invade our 
country, approximately 2 million of whom are known got-aways. These are 
people who have completely evaded U.S. authorities and are roaming the 
interior of American communities, assaulting, raping, and murdering 
Americans. God help us if we have a terrorist attack on our land.

                              {time}  1500

  His subversion of the law has resulted in the highest number of 
illegal alien encounters in a single day, the highest number of illegal 
alien encounters in a single month, and the highest number of illegal 
alien encounters in a single year, surpassing every national record on 
each account.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Georgia.
  Ms. GREENE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, his willful refusal to enforce 
the law has resulted in the most egregious national security crisis in 
the history of our country.
  Democrats are in a quandary. Either they must own the policies of 
murder and crime of American citizens, or they can admit Secretary 
Mayorkas has broken Federal laws and vote to impeach Secretary 
Mayorkas.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, though she sits on the 
Homeland Security Committee, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has 
raised doubts about 9/11 to the false assertion that 9/11 was done by 
our own government. She said that is all true. She also thinks Jewish 
space lasers cause wildfires. She fundraises off defunding the FBI. She 
is a person whose advice Republicans are taking today on this 
impeachment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Schiff).
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I welcome my colleagues to another week of 
impeachment unlimited.
  Having no legislative accomplishments to show for their 14 months in 
power, Republicans are voting on yet another pointless resolution.
  Unable to provide any evidence against President Biden, they have now 
decided to impeach someone else instead. We have serious challenges at 
the border--no one denies that--but these are not serious people.
  By this standard put forward by this hapless majority, every single 
DHS Secretary would have been impeached. This is a policy and political 
dispute, not a high crime or misdemeanor.
  When an administration official tries to extort a foreign leader into 
helping them cheat in an election or leads an insurrection against our 
government, then impeach them. Until then, stop wasting everyone's 
time.
  I have known Ale Mayorkas since we were prosecutors together. He is a 
person of great integrity and devotion to this country.
  This impeachment is baseless, it is unconstitutional, and it should 
be defeated.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas took an oath to protect 
our Nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has violated that 
oath and the public trust.
  Today, I intend to personally uphold the oath of office that I swore 
to my country.
  In my 25 years of dealing with the border as a Federal prosecutor and 
the former chairman of this committee, I have never seen it this 
broken. That is because of one man's actions: his refusal to enforce 
the law, his rescission of successful policies like remain in Mexico, 
and his breach of public trust. His dereliction of duty has led to 8 
million encounters, 300 on the terror watch list, and 2.3 million 
aliens released into the interior, enough to fill 13 States. Another 
200,000 young Americans have died due to fentanyl poisoning.
  These numbers are clear. Secretary Mayorkas is the architect of 
destruction, and the legal justification for his impeachment is strong.
  In the Supreme Court decision The United States v. The State of 
Texas, the Court examined a statute that mandated the government shall 
take into custody any alien that has committed an aggravated felony. It 
is not discretionary. It is mandatory. By failing to uphold this law, 
he has released dangerous and violent criminals into our communities 
and has put every American life at risk.
  Supreme Court Justice Story in 1833 said: ``Where a lord admiral has 
neglected to safeguard the seas, that shall be deemed an impeachable 
offense.'' That is exactly the case we have here. Secretary Mayorkas, 
charged with the defense of air, land, and sea, has failed to defend 
our borders.
  The Founders clearly believed impeachable offenses included neglect 
of duty, violation of public trust, and injury to society.
  When asked before the Supreme Court if impeachment is a proper 
remedy, President Biden's own solicitor general said: In the face of a 
dramatic abdication of statutory responsibility by the executive 
branch, such steps would be warranted.
  Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of those impeachable offenses. He is 
destroying the fabric of this Nation. Americans agree.
  Today, I will proudly stand up for our Nation by voting to remove him 
from office.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas has 
invested significantly in stopping dangerous drugs, like fentanyl, from 
entering the country and launched several efforts targeting smugglers, 
gangs, and cartels.
  Under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, we have more personnel, 
technology, infrastructure, and resources on our borders than ever.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
Titus).
  Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, considering this impeachment resolution is 
the fastest I have seen the House GOP move all session. That is because 
there has been no collection of evidence, only the manipulation of it. 
There has been no meaningful bipartisan engagement, only partisan 
political stunts. There has been no due process. Instead, it is a 
deliberate disregard for the basis of our legal system.
  It has no constitutional precedent or basis, no real backing by 
Senate GOP counterparts who are going to hold the trial, no meaningful 
engagement with policy, and no support from respected legal scholars, 
political pundits, nor former DHS directors.

[[Page H454]]

  History will remember this for what it is, an appeasement of the most 
extreme members of the MAGA base, and put very simply, the brownnosing 
of a man with 91 indictments, several convictions, and two 
impeachments.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Brecheen).
  Mr. BRECHEEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this impeachment 
resolution.
  As Chairman Green of the Homeland Security Committee has reminded our 
committee often in recent weeks, James Madison, the father of our 
Constitution, said: ``If an unworthy man be continued in office by an 
unworthy President, the House of Representatives can at any time 
impeach him, and the Senate can remove him, whether the President 
chooses or not.''
  This impeachment is not about policy difference, though we have them. 
It is absolutely because Secretary Mayorkas refuses to enforce the laws 
that are a part of our Nation's fabric. The rule of law matters. Nobody 
is above it, including Secretary Mayorkas.
  Contrary to what he and the President publicly claim, no new laws are 
needed to stop this crisis. They have created it. Section 212 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act already grants them the authority to 
holler halt.
  We know Secretary Mayorkas is aware of this provision. On day 5 of 
the Biden administration, the President suspended entry by those coming 
from the U.K., Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa. Secretary Mayorkas 
has left us with no other option other than impeachment because he 
refuses to enforce the law.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, Republicans say this 
impeachment is not about policy disagreements, but every argument they 
make is about policies.
  Secretary Mayorkas has taken action to secure the border, but he has 
used different, more humane policies that are not impeachable.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), our Democratic whip.
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, we all agree that 
something needs to be done to fix our broken immigration system, but 
when it comes to doing the work, finding the solutions, House Democrats 
have come to the table, President Biden has come to the table, and the 
Senate has come to the table. Then there is the House GOP.
  The MAGA extremists hold up our national security priorities, our 
commitment to our allies, and to our own readiness, supposedly to 
strike a deal on immigration. The President says let's get it done and 
then he did.
  Instead of pursuing a bipartisan compromise, instead of strengthening 
the security of our border, advancing humane solutions, and doing their 
jobs, they are now impeaching the Secretary of Homeland Security 
without a single allegation of any impeachable crime, not one. 
Impeaching a cabinet member without any evidence of high crimes or 
misdemeanors, that is the breach of public trust here.
  The plan is to impeach the Secretary. Then what? Will the majority 
invest in Border Patrol? No. Their dream budget fires 2,000 Border 
Patrol agents. Just yesterday, Speaker Johnson ridiculed the men and 
women of Border Patrol for supporting the Senate bill saying it is 
probably because it would give them a fair wage. This majority's 
contempt for working people, even those whose mission is to carry out 
border security, has no bounds.
  This extreme MAGA majority has repeatedly rejected funding for 
technology that is needed to stop the flow of fentanyl.
  Here we are. The extreme MAGA majority, what are they going to do 
about the border? Only this sham impeachment.
  They have told us what the future holds. As one Member across the 
aisle put it, they oppose action on immigration, because it would boost 
Biden against Trump. That is all they care about. That is what this 
sham is about, choosing extremism over country, stunts over solutions, 
and politics over people. That is a breach of trust we all must reject.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lee).
  Ms. LEE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
resolution to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  We are here today to address one of the most serious responsibilities 
that we can undertake as Congress, the impeachment of Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas.
  The Committee on Homeland Security has worked diligently to 
investigate and consider the causes and the consequences of the 
catastrophe at our southern border, and it has concluded that it is 
necessary and appropriate to pursue this impeachment.
  Since President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas took office, there have 
been over 8.3 million illegal crossings nationwide. We have seen the 
devastating effects of human trafficking, of fentanyl trafficking, and 
what happens when we cede operational control of our southern border to 
the Mexican drug cartels.
  Secretary Mayorkas has refused to enforce the duly enacted laws 
passed by this Congress. By doing so, he has endangered our homeland, a 
direct violation of his oath of office. Even in the face of irrefutable 
evidence to the contrary, he has given false testimony to Congress, 
claiming that the border is secure. He has defied court orders ordering 
the Secretary to abandon the illegal programs and policies that he has 
implemented, which incentivize illegal immigration.
  House Republicans know that border security is national security, and 
the crisis at our border is a critical threat to our national security 
and the safety of the American people.
  Secretary Mayorkas has willfully and deliberately refused to uphold 
the laws of the United States, he has violated his oath of office, and 
he has breached the public trust.
  Congress has a constitutional duty to secure our border and to ensure 
our communities are safe. We cannot allow an executive branch agency 
head to defy the lawful authority of Congress and the courts in pursuit 
of policies that are contrary to law and endangering Americans. That is 
why Secretary Mayorkas must be impeached.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, the border is not open. 
In fact, under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, this administration has 
removed, returned, or expelled more migrants in 3 years than the Trump 
administration did in 4 years.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. Correa), who is the ranking member on our Border Security and 
Enforcement Subcommittee.

                              {time}  1515

  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, we have something in common with my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
  This country, Main Street, and every one of our districts have a 
challenge with fentanyl. We have all witnessed the deaths in our 
communities of good, young men and women from this scourge of fentanyl. 
Nonetheless, Secretary Mayorkas is doing his job.
  Madam Speaker, I want you to look at this graph. The seizures at the 
border of fentanyl: 2019, 2,800 pounds; 2023, 27,000 pounds of fentanyl 
were seized.
  Madam Speaker, I just got back again from visiting the border. I went 
to San Ysidro, and, again, I asked the men and women in uniform: What 
do you need from us to double these numbers?
  It was a simple answer: We want more resources. We want more 
personnel, more drug-sniffing dogs, and we want more equipment.
  Some of those agents were struggling. They were working double 
shifts. Women, moms, men, and fathers were saying: We don't have time 
for families. We are going to have to find another job.
  Right now we have a solution. We have legislation that the Senate has 
worked on with Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, and the President 
supporting a solution that will bring resources to the border, and the 
majority party here refuses to bring that legislation forward for a 
vote.
  Who is derelict in their duty?
  We must step up and make sure that we protect Main Street and we help 
Secretary Mayorkas do his job and double these numbers.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong).

[[Page H455]]

  

  Mr. STRONG. Madam Speaker, today's legislation is about delivering 
accountability on behalf of the local and State leaders unable to bear 
the weight of thousands of illegal immigrants flooding their 
communities, hospitals, and schools; on behalf of the thousands of 
families who have lost loved ones at the hands of illegal immigrants; 
and on behalf of hundreds of Border Patrol agents stripped of their 
tools to do their job.
  The situation at the border cannot continue. I have seen it firsthand 
during my trips to the southern border. Mayorkas' refusal to enforce 
the laws of our Nation has encouraged millions of illegal aliens from 
160 different countries to cross the border. Over 85 percent of them 
are being released into the United States.
  This is in clear violation of Federal immigration law. Failure to act 
is not an option. The yearlong investigation held by the committee 
confirmed what every American already knew to be true.
  The actions that we will take today against Secretary Mayorkas are 
warranted and utterly urgent. Our country is under attack, and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security is working against America.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act at this critical time.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, if my Republican 
colleagues were serious about the border, then they would drop this 
baseless impeachment and bring up the Senate's bipartisan border 
agreement for debate.
  Be that as it may, they aren't serious about reform. Speaker Johnson 
made it clear that the bill was dead on arrival before he saw the text 
of the bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. Ramirez).
  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Madam Speaker, on the first Homeland Security Committee 
hearing, Professor Bowman, an expert in impeachments, made it clear 
that policy differences are not a legitimate basis for impeachment. 
There is no legitimate basis for impeachment, yet here we are.
  Why?
  It is because Republicans believe persecution is a substitute for 
policymaking.
  I guess when you can't legislate, you punish, right?
  Persecution has become the go-to strategy to score political points. 
We have seen that on Congresspersons Omar, Schiff, Tlaib, and even 
their own Speaker McCarthy, government employees, immigrants, and now 
Secretary Mayorkas.
  While great for political theater, persecution and punishment do not 
solve problems. Policy does. Nonetheless, Republicans are not 
interested in policy. They shut us down for presenting policy. They 
even killed a supplemental they had negotiated for months.
  They are just desperately deflecting attention from their failure to 
govern to secure their own empty reelections.
  If they were serious, then we would be debating policies to address 
the humanitarian crisis and the root causes of migration and fentanyl. 
Clearly they are not.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Illinois.
  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Clearly, they are not serious about solutions, just 
chaos.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).
  Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, many have said what the 
issue is. Many have mischaracterized it, in my judgment.
  The issue presented by the Articles of Impeachment and why they 
should be adopted by the House is not a matter of policy, it is not a 
matter of maladministration, it is not a matter of incompetence, it is 
not a matter of neglect, and it is not even a matter of refusal to 
enforce the law.
  It was stated succinctly and aptly in the District Court opinion that 
ultimately led to the United States Supreme Court last summer in the 
United States v. Texas.
  The core of the dispute is whether the executive branch may require 
its officials to act in a manner that conflicts with a statutory 
mandate imposed by Congress.
  It may not.
  You see, Madam Speaker, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro 
Mayorkas, issued guidelines--administrative law--instructing the 
Department of Homeland Security not to detain criminal aliens nor those 
ordered finally removed. That is what he did, and that was flatly 
contradictory to statutes passed by the Congress in the mid-1990s.
  We are a nation of laws. The Supreme Court has said it cannot referee 
this dispute, it is up to Congress, and the Congress has but one means 
in this situation to vindicate the law. It cannot help the situation by 
shutting down the government or by cutting off funding. There is no new 
Cabinet Secretary to refuse to confirm in the Senate.
  There is but one means: the impeachment of the Secretary who 
purported to issue law defying the Congress. That must result in his 
impeachment if the law is to have any force and if the Congress is to 
remain of any significance in the jurisprudence in the law of the 
United States.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, the Republicans highlight 
the Secretary's enforcement guidelines as an example of breaking the 
law. They fail to mention that the conservative Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals said: ``The guidance does not necessarily violate a single word 
of the statute.''
  The Sixth Circuit also found that the provision of immigration law 
that Republicans frequently cite does not ``. . . creates a judicially 
enforceable mandate that the Department arrest or remove certain 
noncitizens.''
  Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Ivey).
  Mr. IVEY. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.
  The power to impeach is one of the greatest constitutional powers 
granted to the House of Representatives. This awesome responsibility 
should be reserved for high crimes and misdemeanors.
  Nonetheless, House Republicans have decided to abuse that 
responsibility for a cheap political stunt.
  House Republicans have not alleged an impeachable offense. Policy 
disagreements are not impeachable. Even if you strongly believe border 
security should be improved, Madam Speaker, that does not provide 
grounds to remove a Cabinet official.
  That is why former Republican Secretary Michael Chertoff said that 
Mayorkas hasn't committed an impeachable offense. Even law professor 
Jonathan Turley has said that Secretary Mayorkas' alleged actions are 
not impeachable and fail to amount to high crimes and misdemeanors 
warranting his impeachment.
  Republicans offered no constitutional scholars as witnesses during 
their two impeachment hearings, but rather relied on Republican States 
attorneys general's testimony, one of which didn't even mention the 
word ``impeachment'' in his prepared statements.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. IVEY. This unconstitutional impeachment process has been 
predetermined and unjust since it began. It will lower the 
constitutional bar for future impeachments, and it will not make our 
border more secure. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Crane).
  Mr. CRANE. Madam Speaker, Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, 
often known as the invasion clause, says that this government will 
protect every State from invasion.
  That is something that clearly this Secretary is in complete 
dereliction of duty of, and I know that he swore an oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution.
  Now, I am not sure how many Americans have to die of fentanyl or have 
their kids raped and murdered by MS-13 gang members. We had one in 
Homeland Security just a couple weeks ago begging us to do something 
about this absolutely atrocious leadership from the Secretary.
  Nonetheless, it is high time that this individual be held accountable 
for his

[[Page H456]]

complete dereliction of duty at our southern border.
  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
  The last thing I want to say is that I think it tells you everything 
you need to know when my colleagues say that it doesn't matter if you 
impeach Secretary Mayorkas, we are just going to have somebody come in 
and do the same exact job.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 
seconds to the gentleman from Arizona.
  Mr. CRANE. Thank you for saying the quiet part out loud.
  Yes, your policies are so bad that no matter whom you put in there it 
will cause the same amount of damage to the American people. The people 
of this country are watching. Let's get this done.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 90 percent of fentanyl 
seized is interdicted at ports of entry, mostly in passenger vehicles 
driven by U.S. citizens and lawful residents, not migrants. If we 
invest in our ports of entry instead of pursuing this sham impeachment, 
we can scan more of these vehicles.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, smoke and mirrors have never been the 
foundation of the Constitution. That is all we have today to 
misrepresent to the American people that we are doing serious work.
  It comes to mind as to whether or not Secretary Mayorkas is being 
charged with Articles of Impeachment because he is a Cuban immigrant 
who came to the United States with his family as political refugees, 
that they spent time fleeing the Nazis, and that he came here to do his 
very best for the American people. Yet we attempt to charge him with 
willful violation of the law.
  Operational control of the border means zero persons coming across. 
This has not been the case as relates to any Secretary no matter what 
administration. Yet we have failed in this process of false smoke and 
mirrors to allow us to be able to articulate any charge that might 
constitute high crimes and misdemeanors. We failed to provide evidence 
to support the charges such as they are.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. We have failed to name the proper target for 
impeachment in a policy dispute. We have failed to process anything 
against Secretary Mayorkas, and we could not, in any way, bring 
anything to suggest that he violated the law or that he benefited from 
any aspect of his work.
  This Secretary has been denied due process. This is smoke and 
mirrors. The Constitution, which is the foundation of this land, is 
true. There have been no high crimes and misdemeanors or bribery. This 
is an impeachment that should be immediately dismissed.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Articles of 
Impeachment.
  Madam Speaker, it is a sad day that the House has been convened to 
consider an impeachment bill against the current Secretary of Homeland 
Security--a measure that is without merit or consideration of the 
consequences to the agency or how this action may undermine the current 
challenges the nation is facing.
  While this impeachment resolution bears no meaningful or serious 
merits, I offered an amendment for consideration by the Rules Committee 
that would strike Article 1 of H. Res 863--Impeaching Alejandro 
Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, because he is not 
accused of committing any high crimes or misdemeanors.
  Article I of the bill accuses him of ``Willful and Systematic Refusal 
to Comply with the Law.
  Secretary Mayorkas has not committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--the United States Constitution's 
standard, for an impeachment.
  Secretary Mayorkas is carrying out his duties faithfully.
  House Republicans may not approve of the Biden administration's 
policies, but policy differences are not grounds for impeachment under 
the Constitution.
  House Republicans are trying to distract from their inability to 
govern and score political points with their extreme political base by 
impeaching the Secretary.
  Rather than abusing their power as the majority in the House of 
Representatives with an unjustified impeachment process, they should 
focus on keeping the government open and join with Democrats to provide 
border personnel the funding they need to do their job.
  I regret that of the two hearings held that they did not include any 
majority witnesses that were Constitutional Scholars nor a minority 
hearing to allow opposing views to be aired, nor the target of the 
impeachment Secretary Mayorkas being allowed to come before the 
committee in his defense.
  This is the standard set by prior impeachment proceedings but ignored 
by the majority-controlled Homeland Security Committee.
  In 1776 the Framers declared the self-evident and later the universal 
truth that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator 
with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness.
  As important, the Framers declared that ``to secure these rights, 
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just power from 
the consent of the governed.''
  This genius of self-government is the Framers' gift to us and 
America's gift to the world, and for nearly 250 years the world has 
looked upon the United States with wonder, awe, and envy not just for 
its awesome powers and achievements, but for being the exemplar to 
which most freedom-loving nations aspire.
  But as President Lincoln reminded us at Gettysburg, the proposition 
that a people can govern themselves is not to be taken for granted; it 
is a proposition that will be tested time and again and it is for us, 
the living, to highly resolve to commit ourselves to the great task 
always before us, that government of the people, by the people, and for 
the people not perish from the earth.
  As Thomas Paine said in his time, the past fourteen years were times 
that tried one's soul. The nation was tested, severely so, by what can 
only be described as the modern-day Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: a 
deadly pandemic, economic devastation unseen since the Great 
Depression, social justice unrest, and the very real threat of 
authoritarianism.
  While the threat posed by these challenges are still with us to 
varying extent, we can all rejoice that the nation withstood the 
challenge, e pluribus unum, by standing together as ``We The People.''
  President Lincoln reminded us that in times of testing and challenge 
that ``the fiery trial through which we pass will mark us down in honor 
or dishonor until the latest generation'' but that so long as the 
people ``retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any 
extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the 
government' in the short space of four years.''
  And Lincoln was right, for on Election Day 2020, Americans by a 
substantial majority, voted to withhold consent to govern from an 
incumbent administration and confer it upon another.
  That act of self-government and sovereign expression was solemnized 
on January 20, 2021, at noon when Joseph R. Biden and Kamala D. Harris 
took the oath of office as the 46th President and 59th Vice-President 
of the United States.
  The Philadelphia Miracle of 1789 endures but only because we 
Americans resolve that it does and work to make it so.
  The President takes the oath of office pledging to preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution.
  As does every one of my congressional colleagues, I have sacredly 
pledged true faith and allegiance in defending the Constitution against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to execute the duties of the 
office well and faithfully I hold. I do this ever mindful that the 
purpose of our form of government is ``to form a more perfect union, to 
establish justice, to ensure domestic tranquility, to provide for the 
common defense, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the 
blessings of liberty for posterity.''
  But we all have a responsibility to preserve and strengthen this 
constitutional republic and pass it on to the next generation by 
engaging in robust, lawful, and peaceful civic activity to hold our 
government to account and to peaceably assemble when necessary to 
petition for a redress of grievances as shown by the Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, following the example of 
Mahatma Gandhi; by John Lewis and the Civil Rights foot soldiers at the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama; by Elizabeth Cady Staton and 
Lucretia Mott at Seneca Falls; by Cesar Chavez leading the fight for 
human dignity of farmworkers, and by Black Lives Matter demonstrators 
protesting inequalities in the criminal justice system.
  For the work of democracy is never complete, our union is always in 
the process of being made more perfect.

[[Page H457]]

  The ingredients for good policy are competence, capability, and 
willingness to put aside partisanship and place national interest 
first.
  At this moment in our nation's history Republicans are attempting to 
impeach Secretary Mayorkas not for any malfeasance or wrongdoing--but 
because they disagree with his actions carrying out the Biden 
administration's border and immigration policies.
  Using policy differences as grounds for impeachment is an abusive 
political action that the Founders rejected as antithetical to the U.S. 
Constitution.
  Republicans have not alleged that the Secretary has committed an 
impeacbable offense, so their ``reports'' attempting to legitimize 
their unfounded case for impeachment effort contain blatant 
misinformation and politically motivated rhetoric, such as criticizing 
the termination of harmful but barely utilized Trump-era immigration 
and border policies, which were not laws--a fact they either do not 
understand or willfully ignore.
  Such a political theater has no basis in the history of American 
constitutional law, as Article II of the U.S. Constitution sets the 
standard for impeachment of ``civil officers'' as ``Treason, Bribery, 
or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''
  The Biden administration's departure from the failed, cruel, and 
sometimes unlawful border and immigration policies of the previous 
administration is certainly not an impeachable offense.
  Impeachment under these circumstances is not a constitutional remedy 
for political and policy differences.
  Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the most 
egregious political offenses, not policy differences. Indeed, Madison 
objected to the term ``maladministration'' being added to the list of 
impeachable offenses during the Constitutional Convention because it 
would upset the separation of powers.
  The first and only impeachment of a Cabinet official occurred in 1876 
following extensive evidence of corruption.
  Republican Congressman Tom McClintock, the Chairman of the Committee 
on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and 
Enforcement, described Rep. Greene's attempt to impeach Secretary 
Mayorkas over policy disagreements as a ``perilous path'' for future 
governance.
  Chairman McClintock went on to argue that the redefinition of 
impeachment found in H. Res. 863 ``would utterly destroy the separation 
of powers at the heart of our Constitution.
  While these are the basis for this Committee not moving forward in 
the process, there are compelling reasons why the Committee should be 
actively engaged in Immigration Reform.
  Impeachment is not a punishment, sought to be inflicted when one 
branch of government merely disagrees with or dislikes what a 
coordinate branch has done.
  It is a serious remedy designed to prevent abuses of power and is 
designed to ensure that ours remains a government of, by, and for the 
people.
  This is about the duty of the President of the United States--you do 
not impeach people because you disagree with their approach to their 
service to the country or to the provisions on their policy. We do not 
impeach people on that basis.
  No, this resolution does not provide any meaningful or sincere effort 
to protect the American people.
  Rather, this resolution sets forth nothing more than a partisan 
fishing expedition and should be rebuked as such.
  Impeachment is serious, yet here we are engaged in a baseless 
political stunt to impeach our current President.
  The U.S. Constitution governs the order of our Nation, and it 
dictates the work of the Congress.
  Article I detail the powers of the House and the exercising of these 
powers as they relate to the coordinate, coequa1 branches of 
government, codified in Article II, and Article III: three equal 
branches of government coexisting and cohesively working to provide 
oversight to the respective actions of the Congress, the Executive and 
Judiciary.
  Specifically, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 indicates that the 
``House of Representatives . . . shall have the sole power of 
impeachment.'' Article II states that the ``The President . . . shall 
be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''; Article II also 
requires that the ``President take care that the laws are faithfully 
executed.''
  That language is stark and clear--and throughout our history it has 
been used in varying periods where the assessment was that the law has 
been breached.
  Sometimes Congresses are concerned that the weight and view of the 
American people should be considered. Sometimes they are moved by the 
urgency of the matter.
  This has worked, with challenges of course, since 1789, yet the 
outright abuse of our constitution to use impeachment as a political 
tool is an abomination of our congressional duties.
  As constitutional scholars have long laid out the historical 
guardrails and mandates upon which must heed, I would like to point to 
a few salient remarks from the September 28, 2023, Committee on 
Oversight and Accountability hearing entitled ``The Basis for the 
Impeachment Inquiry of President Joseph R. Biden'' as reminders for us 
all here today.
  In the testimony of Michael J. Gerhardt, Burton Craige Distinguished 
Professor of Jurisprudence, University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill, he highlighted the clear warning from Alexander Hamilton in the 
Federalist Papers, and what he foresaw in the dangers of trivializing 
impeachment through petty partisanship.
  As quoted in Alexander Hamilton, No. 65, the Federalist Papers 
(1961), he states that impeachment may ``agitate the passions of the 
whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or 
inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with 
preexisting factions, and will enlist all their animosities, 
partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and 
in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the 
decision will be regulated more by the relative strength of the 
parties, than by the demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''
  As Professor Gerhardt noted, ``in other words, an impeachment 
proceeding, including the initiation of an impeachment inquiry, must 
rise above petty partisanship in order to ensure its legitimacy.''
  And as aptly stated in the testimony of Johnathon Turley, Shapiro 
Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University School 
of Law, in highlighting the carefully crafted powers vested in the 
House of Representatives pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 2, Cl. 5 is that:
  ``The Framers debated and crafted this standard and process to avoid 
an ``anything goes'' mentality. That was the reason our Framers opposed 
the ``maladministration'' standards as too malleable and indeterminate. 
While we continue to have passionate and good-faith debates over the 
meaning of the high crimes and misdemeanors standard, it is not 
intended to give the House carte blanche for any impulsive impeachment 
theory.''
  Nearly fifty years ago, my predecessor, Barbara Jordan, of Texas' 
18th Congressional District, declared, in the first presidential 
impeachment inquiry in more than a century, that:
  My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete, it is total. I 
am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, 
the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution.'' She noted 
``those are impeachable `who behave amiss or betray their public 
trust'' (quoting from the North Carolina ratification convention).
  In this vein, we should not be here today in efforts to betray and 
diminish our Constitution and rule of law.
  The unsubstantiated accusations, that the President of the United 
States has abused his powers and that his conduct is in dereliction of 
his duties as President is flatly outrageous.
  When the Framers of our Constitution designed our government, they 
bifurcated power between the federal and state governments, and divided 
among the branches.
  They vested in Congress the capacity to make the laws, and in the 
Executive the power to faithfully execute those laws.
  Because the House enjoyed a natural superiority, as most 
representatives of the passions of the populace, the Framers vested in 
the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment and made the 
Senate the judges.
  Yet, entirely unlike the incredulous and now confirmed illegality of 
President Trump's behavior while in office, President Biden has 
certainly not earned the same stain of impeachment from the House of 
Representatives and his conduct absolutely does not merit conviction 
and removal from office by the Senate.
  When the Founders inserted the Impeachment Clause in Article I, 
Section 2, Clause 5, they did so to preserve our democracy, protect the 
American people, and to prevent the abuses and excesses of the Chief 
Executive.
  The Constitution has served our nation well for over two hundred 
years.
  Yes, in order to keep faith with the Framers and with our future, we 
must preserve, protect and defend that Constitution and its provisions.
  This impeachment resolution, however, is not one that is within the 
national interest but a disgrace to our government and its entrusted 
duties.
  The reason given for the Impeachment is the border crisis, one that 
this body has not taken any steps to address, but the Senate has sent 
over a border bill to address the border policy issues raised during 
the two Impeachment hearings.
  The response from the House is to stay the Senate Border bill is dead 
on arrival-sight unseen and no counteroffer made.

[[Page H458]]

  As a result of lack of Congressional action, the Biden Administration 
is using the tools it has available to secure the border and build a 
safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.
  Secretary Mayorkas as head of DHS began a whole-of-government 
approach in Fall 2021 to prepare for the end of Title 42.
  In May 2022, Secretary Mayorkas issued the six-pillar plan that 
outlined preparations to prepare for surges in migration and the 
lifting of Title 42.
  The plan showed measurable success.
  The power of immigration reform to reduce unlawful entry is proven 
through the Biden Administration method of promoting the largest 
expansion of legal pathways for safe, orderly, and humane migration in 
decades, and put in new rules to encourage people to use those lawful 
pathways instead of making the dangerous journey to try to enter 
unlawfully.
  The success of the lifting of Title 42 was not sustainable without 
resources and changes being made to immigration laws.
  Instead, Republican governors have become the poster children for 
increased irregular migration because of their work to send people from 
the Southern Border to New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los 
Angeles, which sent a message that unlawful border crossings were 
welcomed.
  The final ingredient is legislative action by Congress to address 
increasing the capacity of immigration courts to prioritize the orderly 
and fair processing of asylum claims of certain recent arrivals, while 
ensuring those not seeking protection or who don't qualify are promptly 
returned to their country of origin.
  The Administration is continuing to aggressively increase legal 
pathways, enforce our immigration laws, target smugglers who prey and 
profit on vulnerable migrants and seek to traffic drugs into our 
country, and work collaboratively with cities and states that are 
impacted.
  Republicans who have used immigration as a wedge issue attempted to 
derail the President's efforts.
  It is time to focus on the places and communities receiving new 
residents and families to make sure the transition a win--win for new 
immigrants and communities.
  Providing Resources to Larger Urban Areas and Rural Areas.
  Democrats have proposed legislation, such as the Dream Act and the 
American Dream and Promise Act, that would provide a pathway to 
citizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as 
children, also known as Dreamers.
  Democrats are focused on providing resources to communities receiving 
migrants, implementing policies to ensure an orderly, humane border, 
and keeping the government funded.
  Democrats also recognize that while there are near-term costs to 
receiving migrants, immigrants contribute significantly to the U.S. 
economy, fuel our growth, and provide a net benefit to our country's 
finances by paying billions in taxes annually.
  Democrats also support comprehensive immigration reform that would 
create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and improve 
border security measures while respecting the rights and dignity of all 
individuals.
  In July 2021, the House passed a bill that would create a pathway to 
citizenship for undocumented farmworkers and their families, called the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act.
  This would protect workers from exploitation and abuse and would 
provide stability for the agricultural industry.
  Democrats have advocated for a comprehensive immigration reform 
package that would address the root causes of migration, improve border 
security, and create legal pathways for people to enter the U.S. 
lawfully.
  The Biden-Harris Administration, under the direction of Secretary 
Mayorkas, are showing Congress, the nation and the world what is indeed 
possible when immigration is not treated like an offense to the nation 
instead of the fuel that drives our economy and injects vitality into 
our communities.
  Because of joint Congressional and White House support since early 
2021, DHS and CBP increased their border holding capacity by over a 
third through the construction of new facilities.
  CBP has increased the efficiency of migrant processing and reduced 
the time noncitizens spend in temporary holding by 30 percent.
  Over the years, I worked with my fellow Democrats and Republican 
Members of this Committee to make sure that these unaccompanied 
children stay safe and have a legal documentation in the United States, 
while the Republican Party sadly has steadfastly opposed all the 
legislations that benefits these children.
  I ask the Rules Committee to reject this Impeachment and begin plans 
to consider the bill sent from the Senate for a resolution to the 
Border crisis.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).
  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, this is a sad day. It is a sad day that 
we have to be here, but the Framers of our Constitution forecasted that 
this could occur.
  While we are going to hear that this is a policy difference, that 
this is maladministration. This is the systemic refusal to follow the 
law and to enforce the law. It is an egregious breach of public trust.
  Moreover, there are no other avenues here. There must be a 
consequence, and there must be accountability. That is why we are 
moving to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas for endangering our country.
  Anyone with common sense can see that what is being allowed to happen 
at our border is not only a catastrophe, but it is a national security 
crisis.

                              {time}  1530

  Madam Speaker, 9 million illegal aliens have entered our country 
since President Biden has been in office, including 300 people that 
have matched the terror watch list.
  It took less than 20 people to orchestrate the attacks on 9/11, which 
sent me into 20 years of service to this country to protect us 
overseas. Yet, we are letting the Trojan horse into our country that 
threatens us. We have a Secretary who refuses to enforce the laws on 
the books.
  It is Congress' duty to ensure that the Department of Homeland 
Security is led by individuals committed to upholding the rule of law 
and protecting our borders, and the failure to secure the border has 
been so severe that we have to provide accountability.
  Not only is this a systemic refusal to follow the law, but it is also 
the systemic deconstruction of the rule of law that eventually will eat 
away at this country.
  I am so concerned, and our country should be concerned.
  Madam Speaker, I urge everyone in this House to do something that 
actually gets accountability, to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, and to get 
our country secure again.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is 
remaining on each side.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 37\1/4\ 
minutes. The gentleman from Mississippi has 39\3/4\ minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, daily removals are nearly 
double what they were compared to pre-pandemic averages. The vast 
majority of individuals encountered at the southwest border throughout 
this administration have been removed, returned, or expelled.
  Secretary Mayorkas is enforcing the law.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Ruiz).
  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to call out the hypocrisy and extreme 
political stunts Republicans are displaying with this baseless and 
unconstitutional impeachment against the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.
  Instead of seeking bipartisan solutions, they voted to cut border 
security funding. Let me repeat that: cut border security funding. They 
are now bringing an impeachment that lacks basis in law just to pull 
another one of their political stunts.
  Secretary Mayorkas has dedicated his career to public service and our 
country. During his time in the Department, he led the development and 
implementation of DACA and led the Department's successful response to 
Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
  He has worked tirelessly on combating human trafficking and developed 
an emergency relief program for orphaned youth following the tragic 
January 10 earthquake in Haiti.
  Secretary Mayorkas has done the work he was tasked to do by the 
President and more.
  Stop wasting time on yet another extreme political farce. Start 
working with Democrats for a bipartisan, real solution.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).
  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge support of H. Res. 
863, the Articles of Impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas.

[[Page H459]]

  It is clear that Secretary Mayorkas has willfully and systematically 
refused to comply with U.S. immigration law. An average of 5,000 
illegal immigrants are being released into the United States each day, 
which is a flagrant abuse of immigration laws passed by Congress 
governing the parole, detention, and removal of illegal immigrants.
  For 3 years, Secretary Mayorkas has refused to enforce the laws 
passed by Congress. He has abused his authority as a Cabinet Secretary. 
He has misled Congress and the American people about the crisis and the 
role his actions and decisions have played in sparking and facilitating 
it.
  As a result, we see record amounts of daily fentanyl flowing into our 
communities, rising crime across our country, and a massive strain on 
our localities, schools, and community services.
  Since Secretary Mayorkas' tenure, over 300 individuals on the 
terrorist watch list trying to illegally enter the United States at the 
southern border between ports of entry have been apprehended by Border 
Patrol agents.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Miller-Meeks). The time of the 
gentleman has expired.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 
seconds to the gentleman from Virginia.
  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, cartels in Mexico are empowered to expand 
lucrative trafficking and smuggling operations across our porous 
southwest border.
  The actions of Secretary Mayorkas have led to a complete humanitarian 
and national security catastrophe.
  Congress must hold the executive branch accountable when they fail to 
uphold the oath of office.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of 
H. Res. 863.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, Republicans ignore the 
fact that no administration has ever had the resources to detain all 
border crossers. President Trump released over 500,000 people without 
ever detaining any of them.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Nadler), the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.
  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the sham 
impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.
  This resolution is filled with false and misleading statements that 
amount to nothing more than policy disagreements. Even if it were based 
in truth, however, policy disagreements are not a legitimate basis for 
impeachment.
  Impeaching a Cabinet Secretary is serious. Unfortunately, House 
Republicans are not. This sham impeachment ran roughshod over due 
process and completely bypassed the Judiciary Committee, the committee 
of jurisdiction for impeachment.

  This is not a serious effort, nor is it a serious resolution.
  Republicans allege that Secretary Mayorkas should be impeached simply 
because he failed to meet the impossible standards set out in our laws, 
standards that no administration, not even President Trump's, has ever 
come close to meeting.
  For example, they allege that Secretary Mayorkas failed to detain 
everyone that the law requires to be held in mandatory detention. To do 
so would require Congress to appropriate over $35 billion a year, a 
number 10 times higher than President Trump ever requested for 
detention. That is why the Trump administration released over 500,000 
people at the U.S.-Mexico border and released 1.1 million people from 
immigration detention into the United States.
  Did we hear calls from the Republicans to impeach Secretaries Kelly, 
Duke, or Nielsen? Of course not.
  The resolution also takes aim at the Secretary's use of his parole 
authority, but Republicans never complained when President Trump used 
his parole authority for tens of thousands of Cubans and military 
families.
  So, what is different now? Could it be that it is an election year 
and Republicans have no record of accomplishments to run on?
  With no ideas, no agenda, and no ability to govern, they are 
cheapening the serious and awesome power of impeachment to score a few 
cheap political points. That is shameful.
  Our immigration system has been broken for decades. Impeaching a 
Cabinet Secretary because you do not like their policies will not 
repair it. Only bipartisan reform can do that.
  Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this 
resolution.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).
  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the impeachment of 
Secretary Mayorkas. His actions support lawbreaking and lawlessness and 
have inflicted a horrific toll on our country. The kind of damage he 
has done to our cities and families is something you would expect from 
a hostile foreign adversary looking to destabilize and destroy America.
  Our cities are overrun, forcing vital services to be cut off or 
reduced, shutting down our schools to house illegal migrants, and 
turning community centers into refugee camps, all while ignoring the 
needs of our own citizens.
  There are more than 110,000 dead Americans from fentanyl that is 
being smuggled by Mexican cartels. We see criminal illegal immigrants 
committing murder, rape, and beating our police in broad daylight.
  This is far more than a policy difference. This is the death and 
destruction of our country and our people. I will not stand by and just 
politely ask the Biden administration to please stop the chaos and 
devastation.
  In a functioning government, people need to be held accountable when 
they have deliberately inflicted harm on our Nation, and that is 
exactly what we are doing today.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, if my Republican 
colleagues were worried about the impacts of migration on our local 
communities, they should support DHS' Shelter and Services Program. 
This is the only Federal program that can provide direct assistance to 
cities and organizations responding to arriving migrants. Instead, they 
are trying to gut this program and impeach Secretary Mayorkas, which 
would accomplish nothing.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Swalwell).
  Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, this is not about Secretary Mayorkas. 
This is straight-up sabotage.
  MAGA Republicans have never accepted President Biden as the 
President, from the day they led an insurrection into this Chamber to 
this day, where they are trying to sabotage solutions at the border.
  Any shortcomings with Mayorkas are the Republicans' fault. The 
Republicans won't give him the authority that he needs to carry out 
more security at the border.
  All we have heard for years is noun, verb, border. You get your 
border deal, led by the second most conservative in the Senate, and you 
are walking away from it. You are walking away from it because Trump 
says you can't have it.
  This place with you all in charge is looking less and less like the 
House Chamber and more and more like Trump's echo chamber.
  What we need right now are solutions, not chaos. With you all in 
charge, you are a party of followers. With President Biden's 
leadership, Democrats continue to show that we are a party of leaders.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.

                          ____________________

                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the 
gallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any 
manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in violation 
of the rules of the House.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon).
  Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, how many Democrats or open border caucus 
members--I apologize for my redundancy there--are willing to house 
migrants in their own homes, Madam Speaker? None. Zero. Nada. They seem 
to all be for providing sanctuary, provided they don't have to provide 
it.
  Alejandro Mayorkas, under oath, testified before Congress and claimed 
the border is no less secure than it was previously. Does anyone in 
this Chamber

[[Page H460]]

actually believe that? Does anyone in this country believe that?
  Let's compare the first 3 years of President Trump's and Biden's 
tenures: President Trump in his first 3 years, 1.6 million illegal 
crossings; Joe Biden, 8.3 million, a 519 percent increase. Terror watch 
list suspects apprehended under Trump were 8 in 3 years; under Joe 
Biden, 361. That is a 4,512 percent increase. Chinese nationals, men 
mostly of military age entering illegally, last year under President 
Trump it was 450, and under Joe Biden it is over 24,000. That is a 
5,333 percent increase.

  No less secure. Is that the new math?
  Opioid deaths have doubled. The Mexican drug cartels are enjoying 
record profits.
  Alejandro Mayorkas fostered this mayhem, and he facilitated 
cataclysmic chaos. He is inept. He is weak. He is impotent. He has 
violated Federal law. He has perjured himself in front of Congress. He 
has lied to the American people. He has undermined his own Border 
Patrol agents.
  Mayorkas has shown the world who he is. He is a sheep in sheep's 
clothing. The cartel wolves and our enemies across the world are 
circling.
  This impeachment is richly deserved, and we must fire this bum, this 
second coming of Benedict Arnold, forthwith.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, let's look at the facts. 
Since May 12, 2023, when title 42 ended, DHS has removed more than 
500,000 individuals. That is more people than Donald Trump removed in 
any given year. The border is not open.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Raskin), the ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability 
Committee.
  Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, we are here because the madcap wild goose 
chase to impeach Joe Biden has produced no wild geese. Even FOX News is 
lampooning the fact that their own expert witnesses repeatedly say that 
President Biden did nothing wrong and that there are no grounds for 
impeachment. More than a dozen GOP Members in Biden majority districts 
don't want to go anywhere near that fantasy production.
  So, the Trump-Putin-MAGA faction, headed up by the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene), has been given this worthless 
trinket of a consolation prize--the opportunity to bring this slapstick 
impeachment drive against a Cabinet member of unimpeachable integrity 
who has obviously committed no treason, no bribery, no high crimes, no 
misdemeanors, nothing indictable or even ``in-dict-able,'' if you 
prefer.
  What makes this farce a tragedy is that Secretary Mayorkas and the 
U.S. Senate have been working for months to achieve precisely the 
immigration and border compromise the GOP has been demanding. 
Miraculously, they got to a bipartisan immigration agreement for 
billions of dollars for more Border Patrol officers, immigration 
judges, and fentanyl detection machines--a far tougher border.
  It was good enough for Senator Mitch McConnell and dozens of GOP 
Senators, and it was good enough for The Wall Street Journal, but the 
House MAGAs would not take ``yes'' for an answer. Why? Because Donald 
Trump doesn't want a border solution. He wants a border problem. 
Nothing else to run on.

                              {time}  1545

  Vladimir Putin certainly doesn't want $60 billion going to the heroic 
people of Ukraine defying his filthy imperialist invasion. All over the 
world, democracy and freedom are under siege today and all our 
colleagues can think to do is to sell out our democratic allies and 
sell out the cause of human rights, and then impeach a Cabinet 
Secretary working diligently to solve the immigration problem that they 
claim to care about.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).
  Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas swore an oath to defend 
the U.S. Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Unfortunately, it seems as though he hasn't defended it from a single 
one.
  Since President Biden took office, there have been more than 7 
million illegal encounters at our southern border and more than 1.7 
million known got-aways. Not once has Secretary Mayorkas issued a 
statement, signed a policy, or taken action to discourage this from 
happening.
  In fact, he has doubled down and encouraged the invasion by endorsing 
catch and release policies, ending title 42, and stopping remain in 
Mexico. This subversion of our Constitution, willful disregard of our 
country's laws, and unfettered dedication to exacerbating the self-
inflicted crisis have left the House with no other option than to 
impeach Secretary Mayorkas.
  Madam Speaker, I urge the House to join me in voting to impeach 
Secretary Mayorkas and I urge the Senate to remove him from his 
position.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues 
that they voted to terminate the COVID-19 national emergency and thus 
voted to end title 42. In addition, DHS has no role in ending this 
policy.
  Madam Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. Magaziner).
  Mr. MAGAZINER. Madam Speaker, the American people want us to be 
working together to solve our challenges at the border. We could be 
working together to vote on President Biden's proposal for $14 billion 
of funding that would add over 1,000 Border Patrol officers. We could 
be working with the Senate on real immigration reform that Republicans 
claimed they wanted until Donald Trump told them that they didn't, but 
instead we are wasting time and energy on an impeachment with no legal 
basis just because it is what Donald Trump wants.
  The facts are this: Congress has allocated funding for 34,000 beds at 
detention centers. The average daily census last year was 37,000. The 
centers are full, and so the Secretary, under the law, uses his legal 
discretion to decide who to detain and who to release--the same legal 
discretion that all of his predecessors have used.
  In the last 2 years of the Trump administration, 52 percent of 
migrants were released, nearly a million people, and I did not hear my 
House Republican colleagues calling to impeach that Homeland Security 
Secretary.
  No. This is about one thing--politics. There are no high crimes, no 
misdemeanors, no treason, no bribery. I would remind my colleagues, our 
oath is to the Constitution, not to Donald Trump.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz).
  Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, it has been said that Secretary Mayorkas is 
dishonest, duplicitous, and derelict in his duties, and I agree.
  However, he has also willfully refused to comply with and enforce our 
Nation's immigration laws and explicitly instructed his employees to 
not enforce these laws.
  Additionally, the Secretary has willfully obstructed inquiries of the 
Judiciary Committee regarding entry of illegal aliens into our country. 
The constitutional standard for impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas has 
been satisfied.
  I commend Chair Mark Green for his excellent work in managing this 
important constitutional matter, and in following regular order while 
doing so.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, despite what Republicans 
want us to believe, the courts at the highest level have not found that 
Secretary Mayorkas is violating the law. Courts are where we go to 
determine whether a Cabinet Secretary is following the law Congress 
wrote, not a partisan impeachment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Escobar).
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
GOP's political stunt of the day: impeaching Secretary of Homeland 
Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
  The real problem here is congressional inaction on immigration 
reform. My community of El Paso, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border has 
been on the front lines of this issue and living with the consequences 
of Congress' failure to act.
  Our Federal personnel, local governments, and shelters are all 
overwhelmed, and Republicans continue to withhold vital funding that 
would help address this issue.
  As a border legislator, I have never met a more committed, accessible 
Cabinet member than Secretary Mayorkas.

[[Page H461]]

He is a great public servant doing everything he can with the limited 
resources Congress has given to him.
  Madam Speaker, I invite my Republican colleagues who really want to 
solve this to join the bipartisan coalition supporting the Dignity Act. 
Stop playing games and do your job.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest).
  Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for 
impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for reasons 
outlined in both Articles of Impeachment, but specifically for Article 
II, breach of public trust.
  Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly testified falsely, misleading 
Congress and the American people. He has done so by saying that the 
southwest border is secure and that his department has operational 
control of the border.
  Secretary Mayorkas in his previous appearances before the Committee 
on Homeland Security has told me personally multiple times, testifying 
while under oath, that the border is secure.
  Time and time again, Secretary Mayorkas has appeared before Congress, 
both the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and 
has repeated that the southwest border is secure.
  These declarations, Madam Speaker, are patently untrue, and they 
contradict statements made by both his former Border Patrol Chief, Raul 
Ortiz, and by the President himself.
  President Biden just recently said and admitted that the border was 
not secure, and he went on to say that the border has not been secure 
for almost a decade.
  Madam Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas' dealings with Congress indicate a 
lack of transparency and an attempt to mislead the public on the true 
conditions that exist at the border, and we, as Congress, must now hold 
Secretary Mayorkas accountable.
  This is a grave day in our history, a grave day for this Nation, and 
not one that we take lightly. However, in light of all the facts, I 
urge my colleagues to join me in voting to impeach Secretary Mayorkas.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues 
won't admit that this impeachment is a sham, but their favorite 
conservative legal experts will.
  President Trump's impeachment attorney, Alan Dershowitz, accused 
Republicans of ``distorting the Constitution;'' and Republicans' 
favorite legal witness, Jonathan Turley, said that: ``There is also no 
current evidence that [Mayorkas] is corrupt or committed an impeachable 
offense. . . . `'
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Menendez).
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the partisan sham 
impeachment proceedings against a dedicated and honorable public 
servant, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  Secretary Mayorkas has done his job while operating within a broken 
immigration system that this Congress has refused to fix. Instead of 
working with House Democrats and the Biden administration on serious 
solutions, House Republicans are focused on one thing: appeasing former 
President Donald Trump.
  This impeachment is an unconstitutional abuse of power. It is clear 
that policy differences are not grounds for impeachment. Even worse, in 
the partisan nature of these proceedings are the alleged facts that 
they are based on. To build their case, House Republicans work with and 
cite reports from groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies, a 
Southern Poverty Law Center designated hate group.
  When I attempted to introduce an amendment to point this out, it was 
rejected by House Republicans twice in committee--once in Homeland and 
once in Rules.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam Speaker, Republicans don't want Americans to know 
the baseless and completely unprecedented nature of this impeachment, 
and that is that antimigrant hate groups form the foundation of the 
case that we are listening to today.
  I stand with my Democratic colleagues against this partisan 
impeachment, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to vote ``no.''
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).
  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, James Iredell, one of the Founders from 
North Carolina, talking about this impeachment clause said: ``The power 
of impeachment is given by this Constitution, to bring great offenders 
to punishment. It is calculated to bring them to punishment for crime 
which it is not easy to describe, but which everyone must be convinced 
is a high crime and misdemeanor against the government.''
  For instance, corruption. ``Its exercise''--the impeachment--``will 
arise from acts of great injury to the community, and the objects of it 
may be such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary tribunal.''
  That is why you have impeachment. It is necessary here because what 
you have is a Secretary who came into Judiciary, he was given the 
language from the Secure Fence Act of 2006. I said: Is the border under 
operational control? He says: Well, no. We have redefined it ourselves. 
We are comfortable with the new definition that we have made. That is a 
violation of the separation of powers.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Arizona.
  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, this is the same Secretary who tells his 
ICE agents you cannot remove 1 million, 1.2 million people who have 
actually had due process through the courts and have active removal 
orders.
  He is the same Secretary who said that we don't have to adhere to 
title 8.
  That has resulted in great injury to our communities, and that is why 
he must be impeached--because he falls on the definitions that one of 
the Founders, James Iredell, said. He is right on the money, and I urge 
everyone to support this movement to impeach.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, the definition of 
``operational control'' in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 has never been 
achieved under any administration, including the Trump administration. 
This is not grounds for impeachment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Garcia).
  Mr. ROBERT GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, today, Republicans 
are engaging in yet another impeachment scam.

  We are here today because the majority wants to attack President 
Biden and Secretary Mayorkas all to elect Donald Trump. The insane 
leader of their party claims that immigrants, like me, pollute the 
blood of this country.
  Donald Trump's rhetoric is just like Hitler's, and he wants chaos. He 
thinks the border crisis helps him, so he wants it to continue.
  In fact, Border Patrol apprehensions more than tripled in the last 8 
months of the Trump Presidency, but let's remember the Donald Trump and 
MAGA vision for border security.
  These are actually some of their ideas: Donald Trump wants to build 
alligator moats. He has proposed bombing Mexico. He has actually said 
we should shoot migrants in the legs and maybe even electrify the 
fence.
  These are cruel and ridiculous ideas, but they are proposals of 
Donald Trump and the MAGA right. This extreme political stunt should 
fail.

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I respect my colleagues across 
the aisle who have voiced their opposition. It is important that we 
clarify the legacy that some of us would condemn by impeaching the 
Secretary responsible for this legacy; and, by contrast, the legacy 
that my colleagues who oppose the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas 
will support:
  300,000 Americans dead from cartel drugs;
  100,000 teenage girls and boys missing, lost by the Mayorkas system 
into the unspeakable horror of sex slavery networks across the 
filthiest corners of criminal organizations in our cities;

[[Page H462]]

  American sovereignty disintegrated, American soil lost to cartel 
human and drug trafficking bases;
  Millions of single military-aged men from over 100 countries 
unvetted, released into our country, creeping into every corner of 
American society, every city, every town;
  Our schools overrun by illegals granted free access to American 
education infrastructure in hundreds of reports with no room left for 
our children;
  Hundreds of thousands of violent criminals released into our Nation, 
despite Federal law stating that DHS shall detain known criminals who 
enter America illegally;
  A thousand or more known or suspected terrorists allowed to pass 
freely into the heart of our Nation, into my State, into yours.
  This is the legacy of Alejandro Mayorkas. By our oath, we must 
impeach this man who has presented an arrogant, defiant tone of denial 
and lies to Congress for 3 years, seemingly content or even proud to 
destroy America day by day. So it is that on this day, it shall be 
written in the historical record of the people's House that Secretary 
of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, has been 
impeached. So shall it be written, so shall it be done.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues 
are starving DHS of necessary border security resources while accusing 
Secretary Mayorkas of not doing his job.
  House Republicans refuse to consider the White House's $13.6 billion 
border supplemental funding request that would pay for more border 
agents and officers and detention beds.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Ms. Jayapal).
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
resolution to impeach Secretary Mayorkas.
  This resolution is as ridiculous as it is dangerous. It has no 
evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors. Are we really debating 
impeaching a Cabinet Secretary because House Republicans don't like the 
policies that he advances under a democratically elected President?
  Far from alleging true high crimes and misdemeanors, this resolution 
relies on the same tired and untrue Republican talking points that 
Democrats have demonstrated for months are not true. With this Marjorie 
Taylor Greene sham impeachment resolution, the majority is bending to 
the will of the most extreme members of their Conference simply because 
they don't like the policies that Secretary Mayorkas is pursuing.
  Secretary Mayorkas is an excellent and dedicated public servant, 
working tirelessly to protect our national security and to address a 
broken immigration system.
  This Republican Congress, the least productive Congress in the 
history of the United States, having passed only 27 bills that have 
been signed into law, despite over 700 votes in this body, is simply 
trying to distract the American people from the fact that they are not 
doing a single thing to address the lives of ordinary Americans across 
this country.
  I keep thinking that the House cannot debase itself further, Mr. 
Speaker, but it appears that we have not reached rock bottom yet. Vote 
``no'' on this sham of an impeachment.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani).
  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, let me start with this: The House is 
pursuing impeachment because there is no option left. Secretary 
Mayorkas has abandoned his job, and he has abandoned the American 
people.
  As the charges describe, the Secretary has willfully and systemically 
refused to comply with the law, and he has put our communities and our 
country at risk by doing so.
  This is not an action we take lightly. The last time a Cabinet 
Secretary was impeached was in 1876. This is a historic impeachment for 
someone with historic failures.
  The time has run out for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to be able to 
do his job. In order to secure our communities, protect our homeland, 
and keep Americans safe, Secretary Mayorkas has got to go.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record op-
eds from frequent conservative legal commentators Jonathan Turley and 
Alan Dershowitz opposing the Mayorkas impeachment, despite their policy 
disagreements with the Biden administration; and a January 30, 2024, 
editorial by the conservative Wall Street Journal titled: ``Impeaching 
Mayorkas Achieves Nothing.''

                 [From the Daily Beast, Jan. 29, 2024]

     Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas' Failures Are Not 
                              Impeachable

                          (By Jonathan Turley)

       Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has been 
     denounced as dishonest, duplicitous, and derelict by his 
     critics. In my view, all of those things are manifestly true. 
     It is also true, in my opinion, that none of those things 
     amount to high crimes and misdemeanors warranting his 
     impeachment.
       The Republican push to impeach Mayorkas has been gaining 
     steam as record numbers of undocumented migrants pour over 
     our Southern border. Even many Democrats are now alarmed by 
     the numbers and the threat that they pose to our national 
     security and to our economy. Sanctuary cities from Chicago to 
     New York are actively trying to prevent new migrants from 
     seeking sanctuary within their own borders.
       At the center of all of this is Mayorkas, who has long been 
     viewed as an enabling figure for illegal migrations. He is 
     also accused of implementing Biden policy changes that 
     removed barriers to migrants, including rescinding the ``Stay 
     in Mexico'' rule.
       Some of us have also questioned his integrity, particularly 
     in controversies like the false claims that border agents 
     whipped migrants in Texas.
       Mayorkas knew the allegations against his own personnel 
     were debunked, but showed little concern or compassion for 
     agents, particularly after President Joe Biden promised they 
     would be punished before any investigation had even begun.
       However, being a bad person is not impeachable--or many 
     cabinets would be largely empty.
       Moreover, being bad at your job is not an impeachable 
     offense. Even really bad. Even Mayorkas' level of bad. If 
     that were the case, he would be only the latest in a long 
     line of cabinet officers frog-marched into Congress for 
     constitutional termination.
       In history, there has only been one cabinet member 
     impeached. That was Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. 
     That alone should concentrate the mind of members. Despite 
     decades of controversial cabinet members accused of flaunting 
     the law or abusing their positions, Congress has only crossed 
     this Rubicon once. There has existed a certain detente 
     between the parties; an understanding that policy-based 
     impeachments could open up endless tit-for-tat impeachment 
     politics.
       The charges against Belknap were serious, in that he had 
     allegedly ``disregarded his duty as Secretary of War, and 
     basely prostituted his high office to his lust for private 
     gain.'' The alleged bribes in contracts in the Indian 
     territories would have constituted impeachable offenses, but 
     Belknap had already left office. His case raised the question 
     of retroactive impeachments for former federal officers.
       The jurisdictional concerns made the difference for 
     Belknap. The final vote on the closest article was 37 to 25 
     in favor of impeachment--four votes short of the number 
     needed for conviction.
       There is no jurisdictional question for Mayorkas, but there 
     is also no current evidence that he is corrupt or committed 
     an impeachable offense. He can be legitimately accused of 
     effectuating an open border policy, but that is a 
     disagreement on policy that is traced to the President.
       In fairness to the GOP, they allege that Mayorkas is 
     violating federal law in releasing what he now reportedly 
     admits is over 85 percent of illegal migrants into the 
     country as well as alleged false statements to Congress. Such 
     releases, however, occurred in prior administrations and the 
     merits of these claims are still being argued in court.
       The courts have long recognized that presidents are allowed 
     to establish priorities in the enforcement of federal laws, 
     even when those priorities tend to lower enforcement for 
     certain groups or areas. It is a matter of discretion.
       Indeed, even under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) which 
     holds the government liable for civil damages, there is a 
     discretionary function exception codified under 28 U.S.C. 
     Sec.  2680 (a) for policy-based judgments.
       Immigration has long been an area of intense policy 
     disagreements. Trump policies were denounced by critics as 
     draconian or even racist. Biden's policies have been 
     denounced as fueling illegal crossings and frustrating 
     efforts to curtail the flow, particularly by border states.
       In my view, Biden has been dead wrong on immigration, but 
     voters will soon have an opportunity to render a judgment on 
     those policies in the election. Mayorkas has carried out 
     those policies. What has not been shown is conduct by the 
     secretary that could be viewed as criminal or impeachable.
       If Mayorkas is violating federal law, he can be brought to 
     court to enjoin his actions. A prior case seeking to prevent 
     the termination of the ``Stay in Mexico'' policy resulted in 
     a win for the Biden administration in Biden v. Texas, when 
     the Supreme Court

[[Page H463]]

     ruled the president had the authority to revoke the Migrant 
     Protection Protocols.
       During the Constitutional Convention, there was a debate 
     over the grounds for impeachment with George Mason arguing 
     for a broad scope of offenses that could ``subvert the 
     Constitution.'' His view was rejected. Most notably, there 
     was a rejection of ``maladministration'' as a basis for 
     impeachment.
       An English trial of Warren Hastings weighed heavily on the 
     forging of the impeachment standard. The former governor of 
     India was charged with various offenses including 
     ``mismanagement and misgovernment...and mistreatment of 
     various provinces.'' While figures like Mason saw the need 
     for the adoption of a similarly broad definition, his 
     suggestion of maladministration was rejected as too broad.
       What Mayorkas is guilty of is maladministration. He has 
     failed to secure the Southern border and has long denied the 
     gravity of this crisis, including refusing to call it a 
     crisis even as daily and monthly crossings reached 
     unprecedented levels.
       None of this means that a cabinet member cannot be 
     impeached. However, not like this. Not for maladministration.
       I hold no brief for Alejandro Mayorkas. However, I hold the 
     Constitution more dearly than I despise his tenure. Absent 
     some new evidence, I cannot see the limiting principle that 
     would allow the House to impeach Mayorkas without potentially 
     making any policy disagreement with a cabinet member a high 
     crime and misdemeanor. That is a slippery slope that we would 
     be wise to avoid. Indeed, it is precisely the temptation that 
     the Framers thought they had avoided by rejecting standards 
     like maladministration.
       That is why the case has not been made to impeach Alejandro 
     Mayorkas.

   Republicans Who Voted Against Impeaching Trump Should Not Vote To 
                            Impeach Mayorkas

                          (By Alan Dershowitz)

       When I represented then-President Donald Trump in his first 
     impeachment case, many Republicans praised me for 
     demonstrating that the Constitution permits impeachment only 
     for ``treason, bribery, and other high crimes or 
     misdemeanors.'' Trump had not been charged with any of those 
     offenses, but rather with vague allegations of abuse of power 
     and obstruction of Congress. The Senate voted to acquit Trump 
     of the unconstitutional charges brought by Democrats. 
     Republicans applauded that result.
       Now many of the same Republicans are seeking to impeach 
     Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on equally 
     vague and unconstitutional grounds. Whatever else Mayorkas 
     may or may not have done, he has not committed bribery, 
     treason, or high crimes and misdemeanors. Testifying to his 
     opinion that the borders are secure is a far cry from 
     perjury. Nor is failure to enforce laws a crime. Indeed, most 
     Republicans do not even claim that his actions or inactions 
     meet these daunting constitutional standards, but they are 
     prepared to apply a double standard based on partisan 
     considerations.
       Double standards are anathema to justice under our 
     Constitution. There must be one Constitution for all, 
     regardless of party affiliation. If Republicans want to amend 
     the Constitution, let them try, but neither the Republicans 
     nor the Democrats have the right to redefine constitutional 
     standards on an ad hoc basis in order to serve their partisan 
     interests.
       So, let's hear from some principled Republicans who may 
     dislike what Mayorkas is doing but who understand that they 
     have previously voted for a standard that has not come close 
     to being met.
       The philosopher La Rochefoucauld said that ``Hypocrisy is 
     the tribute that vice pays to virtue.'' It is also the 
     currency of politics in present-day Washington. But it is 
     wrong regardless of which side promotes it.
       Congress has the power to issue a statement condemning 
     Mayorkas, just as it had the power to issue a statement 
     condemning Trump. But the extraordinary power of impeachment 
     should be reserved for constitutionally impeachable offences 
     and not invoked simply because one party has the votes to do 
     so.
       In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton warned that 
     the ``greatest danger'' regarding the power to impeach would 
     be if it were ``regulated more by the comparative strength of 
     parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or 
     guilt.''
       We experienced that danger when President Clinton was 
     impeached by Republicans and when Trump was impeached by 
     Democrats. Now we are seeing it play out once again with 
     Republicans in control of the House of Representatives.
       Hopefully there will be enough principled Republicans to 
     prevent this abuse of the Constitution. But even if not, our 
     system of checks and balances--which requires a two-thirds 
     vote for conviction by the Senate--will prevent Mayorkas's 
     unconstitutional removal. Even if Mayorkas remains in office, 
     a House vote to impeach him would add to the dangerous 
     precedents established by previous partisan abuses of the 
     impeachment provision.
       The time has come, indeed it is overdue, for members of 
     Congress who claim to be originalists when it comes to 
     constitutional interpretation to recognize that the Framers 
     explicitly refused to allow impeachment and removal for 
     ``maladministration'' or other such vague abuses of duty. It 
     is the voters who are allocated the power to vote against 
     those who fail at governance.
       Just because the Democrats were hypocritical when they 
     impeached Trump on nonconstitutional grounds does not give 
     Republicans the right to do the same. Two wrongs make a 
     fight, not a right. And the real losers are the American 
     people, who count on Congress to uphold the Constitution, 
     especially in areas of impeachment, where the courts have 
     taken a hands-off view.
       We live in an age in which partisanship too often trumps 
     principle, and in which noble ends are thought to justify 
     ignoble means. There is a reasonable dispute about how to 
     achieve border security. I may agree with some Republicans 
     who are critical of the current administration's border 
     policies and who place the blame on Mayorkas. But these 
     criticisms--whether one agrees or disagrees with them--do not 
     justify distorting the Constitution.
       It is particularly essential in an age of partisan division 
     that the nonpartisan principles of our Constitution be 
     scrupulously obeyed. So I urge principled Republicans who 
     care about the Constitution to oppose those in their party 
     who are seeking to impeach and remove Mayorkas based on 
     nonconstitutional accusations.

             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2024]

                  Impeaching Mayorkas Achieves Nothing

                        (By The Editorial Board)

       House Republicans are marking up articles of impeachment 
     against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and 
     the question is why? As much as we share the frustration with 
     the Biden border mess, impeaching Mr. Mayorkas won't change 
     enforcement policy and is a bad precedent that will open the 
     gates to more cabinet impeachments by both parties.
       The Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday began marking up 
     two articles of impeachment against Mr. Mayorkas--one for 
     breach of trust and the other for ``willful and systemic 
     refusal to comply with the law.'' The articles say these are 
     ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that justify removal from 
     office.
       The 20-page political indictment certainly is a sorry list 
     of policy failings on Mr. Mayorkas's watch and their damaging 
     consequences for American cities and states. These include 
     the entry of migrants on the terrorism watch list, and an 
     increase in average encounters at the border from 590,000 in 
     fiscal years 2017-2020--to 1.4 million in 2021, 2.3 million 
     in 2022 and 2.4 million in 2023.
       These are failures of policy and execution, but are they 
     impeachable offenses? That seems doubtful. The first article 
     cites Mr. Mayorkas for refusing to implement a law that 
     requires detention of aliens. It says his policy of ``catch 
     and release'' is impeachable.
       Yet the Supreme Court has not ruled that the Biden policies 
     are illegal. The High Court in 2022 let the Biden 
     Administration end Donald Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, 
     and last year it ruled 8-1 that states don't necessarily have 
     standing to challenge the federal government's enforcement 
     priorities.
       As for catch and release, one problem is the statutory 
     ``credible fear'' standard for claiming asylum in the U.S. 
     The standard is too low, but it isn't clear under the law 
     that the Administration can legally deport people claiming 
     asylum before they get a hearing. The U.S. lacks the 
     facilities to hold asylum claimants, so they are released to 
     await their hearing--and that can take years. But the problem 
     is asylum law, as Republicans have long argued.
       Article I also claims Mr. Mayorkas has violated the law by 
     expanding humanitarian parole beyond Congress's intent. 
     That's probably true, but the law puts no cap on parole 
     numbers. Texas and other states challenged the President's 
     authority to use parole for large classes of migrants, but 
     the Supreme Court ruled against them.
       House Republicans dislike how the Administration is 
     interpreting immigration law. But Congress has failed to 
     reform asylum standards or humanitarian parole, or to 
     otherwise tighten immigration rules. That's why Senators are 
     now negotiating over language to reform both the asylum 
     standard and parole.
       If Congress holds Mr. Mayorkas impeachable for policy 
     failure, what's the limiting principle? Are his deputies also 
     guilty of ``high crimes'' for implementing the Biden 
     immigration agenda? Career officials? How many GOP cabinet 
     secretaries will the next Democratic House line up to 
     impeach? Policy disputes are for the voting booth, not 
     impeachment.
       All the more so because the main architect of the border-
     security fiasco isn't Mr. Mayorkas. It's his boss, President 
     Biden. ``If you want to flee and you are fleeing oppression, 
     you should come,'' said Candidate Joe Biden in a 2019 debate. 
     Mr. Mayorkas is following White House orders.
       Impeaching Mr. Mayorkas won't have any effect on policy, or 
     even on the politics of border security. Most voters don't 
     know who Mr. Mayorkas is. Even if the House passes the 
     articles, on a largely partisan vote, there is no chance the 
     Democratic Senate will convict him. Impeaching Mr. Mayorkas 
     would be the political equivalent of a no-confidence vote. 
     This would continue Congress's recent trend of defining 
     impeachment down.
       Grandstanding is easier than governing, and Republicans 
     have to decide whether to accomplish anything other than 
     impeaching Democrats. Mr. Mayorkas is an easy political 
     target, but impeaching him accomplishes nothing beyond 
     political symbolism.

[[Page H464]]

       A better idea is to strike a deal with Mr. Biden on serious 
     border-security reforms that would restrict his discretion on 
     parole, rewrite the asylum standard, and give the executive 
     other tools to control the border. If Messrs. Mayorkas and 
     Biden refuse to use them, the GOP will have an election 
     issue. And the tools will be there for the next President to 
     use.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).
  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this is so frustrating because today we are, 
in fact, impeaching upon. We are impeaching upon for the President. The 
Secretary is being impeached for what he did wrong. He is, in fact, 
guilty as alleged, but, in fact, he is just part of the high crimes and 
misdemeanors of the President of the United States.
  It was the President's decision to, in fact, undo policies that were 
working, to reverse, to make a systemic change that in my district, 
with over 55 miles of Mexican border, my border agents are reduced to 
being Uber drivers for everyone coming over the border.
  I am perfectly willing to listen to people say that this is a policy 
difference, but it is not. To faithfully execute the mission, you can 
have differences in how to do it. To thwart the very execution of that 
mission, which Secretary Mayorkas has done, is, in fact, an impeachable 
offense.
  I have some sympathy for him because I believe he is just obeying the 
orders of his boss, but that has been said before. That excuse has been 
used. The fact is, he took an oath. He must faithfully execute that 
oath. If he cannot, because the President will not let him do it, then 
he needs to resign.
  As we impeach the first Cabinet officer in well over 100 years, the 
fact is, he should have resigned rather than to do things which were 
adverse to the Constitution, adverse to his oath, but upon the orders 
and duty of the President.
  The President can be wrong. The President can order high crimes and 
misdemeanors. The President can be guilty of them. This President is, 
in fact, guilty of that which we are impeaching the Secretary for 
today, but so is the Secretary, and for that reason, I urge a ``yes'' 
vote.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
remains for each side.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DesJarlais). The gentleman from 
Tennessee has 22\1/2\ minutes remaining.
  The gentleman from Mississippi has 24 minutes remaining.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, this baseless sham 
impeachment fails to articulate a single charge that rises to the level 
of high crimes and misdemeanors, the constitutional standard for 
impeachment. Mere policy differences do not amount to impeachable 
offenses.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter by eminent 
constitutional scholars opposed to this political stunt, as well as The 
Washington Post op-ed by Joshua Matz and Norman Eisen titled, ``Why 
impeaching Mayorkas would violate the Constitution.''

                                                 January 10, 2024.
     Speaker Mike Johnson,

     Washington, DC.
     Chairman Mark Green,
     Washington, DC.

   Constitutional Law Experts on the Impeachment Proceedings Against 
           Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas

       Senior Republicans in the House of Representatives--
     including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Chairman Mark 
     Green of the Committee on Homeland Security--have stated that 
     they intend to pursue an impeachment of Homeland Security 
     Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. This proceeding will apparently 
     occur in the Committee on Homeland Security on an accelerated 
     timeframe. As scholars of the Constitution, considering the 
     facts currently known and the charges publicly described, we 
     hereby express our view that an impeachment of Secretary 
     Mayorkas would be utterly unjustified as a matter of 
     constitutional law.
       Although House Republicans have offered various 
     justifications for an impeachment, the underlying basis 
     appears to be their view that Secretary Mayorkas's policy 
     decisions have degraded border security and involved 
     objectionable uses of enforcement discretion. House 
     Republicans have also publicly asserted that Secretary 
     Mayorkas testified falsely in stating that he is enforcing 
     existing federal law and that the southern border is closed 
     and secure.
       When the Framers designed the Constitution's impeachment 
     provisions, they made a conscious choice not to allow 
     impeachment for mere ``maladministration''--in other words, 
     for incompetence, poor judgment, or bad policy. Instead, they 
     provided that impeachment could be justified only by truly 
     extraordinary misconduct: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high 
     Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Const., art. II, Sec. 4. 
     Thus, as Charles L. Black, Jr. noted in his influential 
     handbook, impeachment is not permitted for ``mere inefficient 
     administration, or administration that [does] not accord with 
     Congress's view of good policy.'' Simply put, the 
     Constitution forbids impeachment based on policy 
     disagreements between the House and the Executive Branch, no 
     matter how intense or high stakes those differences of 
     opinion.
       Yet that is exactly what House Republicans appear poised to 
     undertake. The charges they have publicly described come 
     nowhere close to meeting the constitutional threshold for 
     impeachment. Their proposed grounds for impeaching Secretary 
     Mayorkas are the stuff of ordinary (albeit impassioned) 
     policy disagreement in the field of immigration enforcement. 
     If allegations like this were sufficient to justify 
     impeachment, the separation of powers would be permanently 
     destabilized. It is telling that there is absolutely no 
     historical precedent for the impeachment charges that House 
     Republicans have articulated. To the contrary, on the rare 
     occasions that Members of the House have proposed impeaching 
     executive officials for their handling of immigration 
     matters, the House has properly retreated from that grave 
     step.
       We hold a wide range of views on the wisdom and success of 
     Secretary Mayorkas's approach to immigration policy. But we 
     are in agreement that impeaching him based on the charges set 
     forth by House Republicans would be a stark departure from 
     the Constitution.
       Of course, our institutional affiliations are listed for 
     identification purposes only, and our signatures reflect our 
     personal capacity, not any position on behalf of our 
     employers.

                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 2024]

         Why Impeaching Mayorkas Would Violate the Constitution

                   (By Joshua Matz and Norman Eisen)

       House Republicans appear poised to rush through a partisan 
     impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland 
     security. They do not allege corrupt, abusive or criminal 
     conduct; they accuse him merely of poor judgment, believing 
     he could better use his legal authority and enforcement 
     discretion to safeguard the southern border.
       Whatever the wisdom of Mayorkas's policy decisions, the 
     claim that he should be impeached is indefensible as a matter 
     of constitutional law.
       In designing the U.S. Constitution, the framers adapted the 
     impeachment power from England but made several key changes. 
     Parliament had historically impeached royal ministers for 
     ``maladministration''--for bad policy or poor performance in 
     office. The

[[Page H465]]

     framers rejected that vision. For impeachments of ``the 
     President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the 
     United States,'' they instead required proof of egregious 
     malfeasance: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
     Misdemeanors.''
       This decision was fundamental to the separation of powers. 
     Congress has many tools it can use to shape public policy and 
     express disagreement with the executive. Impeachment, 
     however, is not one of them. To ensure that the president 
     could govern--and that he could select a Cabinet to execute 
     his vision--the framers forbade impeachment over policy 
     disagreements, no matter how fierce or consequential.
       That understanding has endured throughout American history. 
     Despite centuries of heated policy disagreements between 
     Congress and the executive, there has been only a single 
     impeachment of a Cabinet official. In 1876, War Secretary 
     William Belknap was impeached for a corrupt kickback scheme; 
     although he resigned minutes before the House vote, that did 
     not deter House members from impeaching him anyway.
       Of course, not all executive branch officials are angels. 
     But in practice, miscreant Cabinet officials are not 
     corralled through congressional impeachment. They are fired 
     by the president, or they simply resign.
       No official who maintained the president's support has ever 
     been impeached for carrying out policy in ways the House 
     found objectionable. Impeaching Mayorkas on that basis would 
     offend the Constitution and unbalance the separation of 
     powers. Future Cabinet officials would be unduly chilled in 
     doing their job, and presidents would fear that heated policy 
     disputes might engulf their most senior officials in an 
     impeachment quagmire.
       This concern applies with full force in the homeland 
     security setting. The rule that we do not impeach over policy 
     disagreements has had its strongest expression in disputes 
     over immigration enforcement. There are two illuminating 
     precedents.
       The first occurred in 1920, when the House considered 
     impeaching Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis Post. Over the 
     previous year, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had 
     carried out his infamous ``Palmer Raids,'' indiscriminately 
     rounding up suspected radicals, anarchists and communists for 
     deportation. When those deportation orders reached Post's 
     desk (the Labor Department then oversaw immigration matters), 
     he canceled more than 1,000 of them, citing the absence of 
     evidence justifying removal.
       The response was explosive. A New York Times editorial 
     claimed that Post ``let loose on the country these public 
     enemies, some of them fugitives from justice.'' Rep. Homer 
     Hoch, a Republican from Kansas, put forward an impeachment 
     resolution, which was referred to the House Rules Committee.
       Post was outraged. He viewed an initial report accusing him 
     of misconduct as ``mental dullness at high tension.'' As Post 
     later wrote, ``I had offended by deporting such aliens as 
     were proved guilty and releasing the others, instead of 
     pitching all of them out of the country indiscriminately.''
       Post's ensuing testimony before the Rules Committee was 
     electric. As one observer remarked, the committee ``had very 
     much the aspect of a group of gentlemen who had picked up a 
     very hot poker and were looking for some place to cool it.'' 
     The drive to impeach collapsed.
       A similar tale unfolded less than two decades later. In 
     1938, Martin Dies Jr., the chairman of the House Un-American 
     Activities Committee, accused Labor Secretary Frances Perkins 
     of wrongly failing to deport an accused communist. As Dies 
     escalated his attacks against Perkins's immigration policies, 
     she bitingly responded: ``It is not usual for the legislative 
     branch which has so many duties to attempt to usurp the 
     functions and duties of the administrative branch.''
       Undeterred, another member of Dies's committee introduced 
     an impeachment resolution. Among other things, and 
     reminiscent of the latest attacks against Mayorkas, it 
     accused Perkins of ``having failed, neglected, and refused to 
     enforce the . . . immigration laws of the United States.''
       Perkins was shaken. But she maintained support from 
     President Franklin D. Roosevelt and vigorously defended her 
     handling of immigration matters, including in closed-door 
     testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.
       Ultimately, the committee concluded that ``sufficient facts 
     have not been presented or adduced to warrant the 
     interposition of the constitutional powers of impeachment by 
     the House.'' The decision was unanimous. With respect to 
     Perkins's handling of a particularly controversial 
     deportation decision, it found that her decision ``involved a 
     question of judgment, and there is no evidence that it was 
     not exercised in good faith.''
       As these cases confirm, disagreement over a Cabinet 
     official's good-faith exercise of enforcement discretion is 
     not a valid basis for impeachment. In launching an 
     impeachment attack against Mayorkas, House Republicans not 
     only violate the Constitution but also defy long-standing 
     precedents. They should step back from the brink.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).
  Mrs. BICE. Mr. Speaker, earlier in this debate, the gentleman from 
Mississippi noted that there has been more fentanyl seized at our 
southern border than ever before, but what he did not recognize is that 
there are now more fentanyl deaths in this country than ever before, 
and that is a direct result of what is happening across our southern 
border.
  I rise today in support of the impeachment of Secretary Alejandro 
Mayorkas. This is one of the most solemn and consequential actions the 
United States House of Representatives can take, and I do not take it 
lightly.
  However, under the watch of Secretary Mayorkas, we have witnessed the 
degradation of our border security and the willful and consistent 
refusal to comply with and enforce Federal immigration laws.
  Today, fentanyl is the leading cause of death for those aged 18 to 
45, terrorists on the FBI watch list are being released into the 
interior of the country, and the cartels are a multibillion-dollar 
business.
  The crisis we face today is a threat to every single American, 
causing our communities to be less safe, and it is a direct result of 
Secretary Mayorkas' actions. A clear message must be sent to the 
executive branch that they no longer get to break the law without 
consequences. Secretary Mayorkas must be held accountable.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today three bipartisan 
former Secretaries of Homeland Security wrote to Speaker Johnson 
voicing their opposition to impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. They agree 
that impeachment for policy is not constitutionally permissible. They 
further warn that allowing impeachment of Cabinet officials over policy 
differences would jeopardize our national security.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from Secretaries 
Chertoff, Napolitano, and Johnson.
                                                 February 6, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker of the House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Johnson: As former Secretaries of Homeland 
     Security who served in Republican and Democratic 
     Administrations, we write to oppose the House of 
     Representatives' effort to impeach Secretary Alejandro 
     Mayorkas.
       We have differing views among us on the policies pursued by 
     President Biden and implemented by Secretary Mayorkas. But we 
     collectively agree that policy differences are not 
     Constitutionally permissible impeachment offenses. Rather, 
     they are issues to be resolved via legislation or elections.
       During our respective terms, when members of Congress of 
     both parties disagreed with the policy choices made by the 
     Presidents we served, they would make their views known, 
     often vociferously, bring us to the Capitol for hearings, and 
     consider new laws. That is the way our political system is 
     supposed to work.
       To instead allow impeachments of cabinet officials over 
     political disagreements would jeopardize our national 
     security; make Cabinet-level positions more difficult to fill 
     under future administrations; and undermine the ability of 
     future officials to fulfill their vital missions.
       And one cannot ignore that the Department of Homeland 
     Security is responsible for much more than managing our 
     immigration system. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas could 
     undermine the mission for which the Department was created--
     preventing terrorism--as well as our cybersecurity, aviation 
     security, maritime security, our response to natural 
     disasters, and the protection of our national leaders, among 
     many other things.
       If you want a solution to strengthen our border security--
     and a solution is badly needed--you would be well advised to 
     work with the Senate on the bipartisan bill they have put 
     forward. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas solves nothing and 
     leaves our outdated immigration system exactly where it is 
     now--broken.
       We urge you to set aside this groundless impeachment effort 
     and get back to solving America's real problems.
           Sincerely,
     Michael Chertoff,
       Secretary of Homeland Security, 2005-2009.
     Janet Napolitano,
       Secretary of Homeland Security, 2009-2013.
     Jeh Charles Johnson,
       Secretary of Homeland Security, 2013-2017.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Goldman).
  Mr. GOLDMAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn this 
rushed, baseless sham impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas that will go 
down in history as one of Congress' darkest moments.
  The Republican argument for impeachment boils down to their view

[[Page H466]]

that Secretary Mayorkas has intentionally caused the influx of 
immigrants over our southern border. Never mind that, even if true, 
this is not a high crime or misdemeanor that has ever been used before 
in the history of our country. Never mind that, no court has found the 
Secretary or the Department of Homeland Security to have violated the 
law. In fact, the United States v. Texas case, which my friends on the 
other side of the aisle like to cite so frequently, actually reversed a 
district court ruling and held that there must be discretion given to 
the Secretary as there has been given to every single Department 
Secretary for 27 years.
  Never mind that every one of those Department of Homeland Security 
Secretaries has interpreted the law the exact same way that Secretary 
Mayorkas has. Never mind that Republicans have sued him to stop him 
from implementing the policy changes that the administration has tried 
to put in effect to address the situation at the border. Never mind 
that House Republicans are impeaching him for failing to address the 
problems at the border while he has spent months negotiating a 
bipartisan bill in the Senate to do just that.

                              {time}  1615

  The reason for this partisan stunt is simple. Donald Trump and House 
Republicans want to use the border as an election year issue rather 
than actually solve the problems through necessary legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues who care about the Constitution, 
the rule of law, and this institution to vote ``no.'' They will 
otherwise come to regret this.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the last Secretary of Homeland Security 
appointed by a Democratic President once described a border crisis as 
more than 1,000 Border Patrol encounters per day. In December last 
year, we averaged nearly 10 times that number.
  Perhaps most worryingly, 2023 saw a record-setting 860,000, just a 
little bit shy of a million got-aways, border crossers who were 
detected but who were never apprehended. That is nearly a million 
potential felons, cartel members, terrorists, and drug traffickers 
freely allowed into our country and currently residing in our 
communities and our neighborhoods.
  This crisis has been aided and abetted through the unprecedented 
dereliction of duty of Secretary Mayorkas. As the House Homeland 
Security Committee has uncovered, Mayorkas has repeatedly violated, 
subverted, and simply ignored multiple laws set forth by Congress that 
he swore an oath to uphold, all while ignoring court orders and lying 
to Congress and the American people.
  The evidence of his wrongdoings is damning. His abuse of power goes 
well beyond simple bureaucratic incompetence. His actions, which have 
put our Nation at extreme risk, cannot go unanswered.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are exploiting 
impeachment power to distract from their inability to pass legislation.
  Here is what Republican Representative Chip Roy said in November: ``I 
want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing--one--that I can go 
campaign on and say we did. One. . . . [E]xplain to me one material, 
meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done.''
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Jeffries), the Democratic leader.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the distinguished 
gentleman from the great State of Mississippi for yielding, for his 
leadership, for his dignity, for his decency, for his continued defense 
of our democracy in the face of the extreme attacks coming from the 
other side of the aisle.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this political 
stunt, this reckless Republican effort to impeach Secretary Mayorkas.
  Let's be clear: Secretary Mayorkas is a good man, a patriotic man, 
and a hardworking man doing the best he can under very difficult 
circumstances. That is not an impeachable offense.
  Extreme MAGA Republicans have produced no evidence that Secretary 
Mayorkas has engaged in a high crime or misdemeanor, no evidence that 
Secretary Mayorkas has engaged in an impeachable offense, and no 
evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has broken the law or violated the 
Constitution--not a shred of evidence, not a scintilla of evidence, 
nothing but extreme MAGA Republican chaos and confusion and the effort 
to avoid doing the hard work necessary to find common ground to 
actually address the challenges at the border.
  What do these impeachment articles have to do with the issue of 
addressing our broken immigration system? Nothing.
  What do these impeachment articles have to do with building a healthy 
economy for everyday Americans? Nothing.
  What do these impeachment articles have to do with addressing the 
inflationary challenges and affordability issues that the American 
people are experiencing day after day as we work to continue to emerge 
from a once-in-a-century pandemic that shut down the economy? 
Absolutely nothing.
  Extreme MAGA Republicans have spent this entire Congress not 
advancing any ideas, acting on any agenda, deciding to work together 
with us to solve problems for the American people.
  You have brought Articles of Impeachment that are not anchored in 
reality. You have brought Articles of Impeachment for one simple 
reason: Because you really want to impeach Joe Biden.
  That is what you were directed to do by the puppet master, the former 
President of the United States, Donald Trump.
  You really want to impeach Joe Biden, but you realize that that is 
politically unpopular, so you have brilliantly come up with, in your 
minds, plan B. Let's go after Secretary Mayorkas. No evidence that he 
engaged in wrongdoing, committed a crime, or violated the Constitution, 
but let's go after Secretary Mayorkas.
  Maybe that will satisfy the quest for revenge of the puppet master 
because when the puppet master, Donald Trump, says jump, extreme MAGA 
Republicans respond: How high? We just got evidence of that over the 
last few weeks because extreme MAGA Republicans have been lecturing 
America that we have to deal with the challenges at the border.
  We agree. A bipartisan process has been underway in the Senate for 
months to try to fix our broken immigration system, but as soon as 
Donald Trump says no, we actually don't want to do anything about the 
challenges at the border because, politically, that might not be good 
for us, you walked away from working together in a commonsense fashion 
to fix our broken immigration system. Instead, what you have to offer 
the American people is this sham impeachment, this political stunt, 
this waste of time.
  You will not fool the American people. You will actually be held 
accountable for your inaction and your affirmative leaning into doing 
things that don't advance progress in any way, shape, or form for the 
American people.
  No reasonable American can conclude that you are making life better 
for them with this sham impeachment, but you will live with this like a 
scarlet letter.

  It may succeed. It may not. Secretary Mayorkas should wear this like 
a badge of honor because it is worthless. It means nothing.
  It is fake. It is fraudulent. It is foolish.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to vote ``no,'' so we can get back to 
doing the real business of the American people.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for 
yielding and for his great work on this impeachment resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas' political career is on the chopping 
block, where it rightfully belongs. He has failed to apply the laws 
that would stop this invasion at the southern border.

[[Page H467]]

  To those who claim that this impeachment is for purely political 
purposes, you are dead wrong. This is about upholding the rule of law 
that governs our Republic, the same rule of law that Secretary Mayorkas 
has ignored and forsaken every day.
  Secretary Mayorkas has had innumerable opportunities to enforce the 
laws that are already on the books but has chosen not to. He has earned 
his own impeachment.
  Let's be clear: Our entire constitutional system is predicated on the 
idea that Congress creates laws, and the executive branch enforces 
those laws.
  Allowing this abuse of our constitutional system to go unchecked 
could spell the beginning of the end for our Republic.
  I am proud to serve as a cosponsor of these impeachment articles. The 
rule of law must be restored at the border immediately.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, Republicans use the 
language of invasion and great replacement theory, but invasion in the 
Constitution means invasion during an act of war by a foreign nation or 
insurrection from within.
  I direct my Republican colleagues to Federalist Papers Nos. 4 and 43 
if they want to learn why the entry of migrants escaping crisis for a 
better life is not invasion.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank our fearless leader and the good 
gentleman from Tennessee for yielding time.
  Just a comment about this not being an invasion: No honest or 
objective American, from sea to shining sea, could characterize what is 
happening at our southern border in any way other than an invasion, and 
it is destroying our country.
  It is because of willful neglect. It is because of dereliction of 
duty. It is because of the faithlessness to this Constitution and its 
first job: to provide a common defense.
  I thank Chairman Green for restoring the dignity and integrity of the 
impeachment process. I think it is important that we are careful and 
that we make the fullness of due process an important feature, 
restoring what has happened over the last two impeachments.
  This is a yearlong process, and I appreciate his fidelity to the 
Constitution and the integrity of this institution.
  The bottom line, Mr. Speaker: I believe that the Impeachment Clause 
in the Constitution, according to our Founders, was to give remedy for 
this very circumstance, to remove someone who had violated their public 
trust in a way that resulted in serious and systemic injury to society.
  I thank Chairman Green, again, for his leadership. I stand with him. 
This is the right and responsible thing to do in faithfulness to the 
Constitution, in the protection of the American people, and in defense 
of the sovereignty of the greatest Nation in human history.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, the extreme MAGA Republican 
stunt to impeach Secretary Mayorkas is baseless.
  The Democratic staff of the Committee on Homeland Security thoroughly 
documented the many failures of fact and law in the Articles of 
Impeachment contained in H. Res. 863.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the key findings and 
introduction of the Democratic staff report, which can be found online 
at: https://democrats-homeland.house.gov/download/ homelanddemimpeachmentreportfinal.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Jackson Lee).

                              {time}  1630

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for 
yielding.
  In the time that we have had to debate one of the most sacred and 
deliberative responsibilities of the United States Congress--that is, 
impeachment proceedings--there has not been one iota of truth and/or 
facts that would suggest that Secretary Mayorkas is, in fact, guilty of 
the Articles of Impeachment against him: One, the willful violation of 
the law, and the benefit to himself from anything that he might have 
done or that he did not do.
  What it has done is given to this Nation, a Nation of laws and a 
Nation of immigrants, the sense that you cannot flee Nazism, you cannot 
flee Cuba, and come to this country to serve your beloved adopted 
country for more than two decades, that you cannot be the Justice 
Department U.S. attorney, you cannot be a Deputy Secretary and now the 
Secretary of Homeland Security without those who find it strange to 
have you, with your diversity, to be able to lead in this way.
  This is a question of stunts over solutions, and the Constitution was 
created to create a more perfect order, and that is that, under that 
Constitution, precious rights fall under the Fifth Amendment and the 
14th Amendment, due process.
  Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that this Secretary of Homeland Security was 
not allowed to bring his own witnesses. The majority did not allow the 
minority to have its day of witnesses. There were no constitutional 
scholars who pointed to the fact in large numbers, as they would have, 
that this is, in fact, a fraud, and it is fraught with 
misrepresentations.
  Operational control is zero people crossing the border. That means 
they are not crossing for entertainment, they are not crossing for 
business, they are just there.
  This is wrong. This is wrongheaded. This is a stunt, and this does 
not bequeath or equal to the Constitution, which is to create a more 
perfect Union.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against these Articles of 
Impeachment.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).
  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 863, the 
impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.
  Mr. Speaker, Montana is about the same size as from here to Chicago 
plus 2 miles. It is a long, long border. The few border people we have 
generally are deployed down south.
  My friend and the gentleman from New York said: What evidence do we 
offer? What evidence of negligence? What evidence of wrongdoing? I 
would say it is pretty easy to find. It is found in every street, every 
city, every county, every State across this Nation.
  The evidence is found in every fentanyl pill and death. The evidence 
is found in every woman that is raped along our border. The evidence is 
found in every child-trafficking case that is in every city, to include 
Billings, Missoula, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. It is found in every 
evidence of children being sex trafficked, and I could go on.
  The evidence of negligence is the willful blindness to the horror 
that we have on our southern border.
  Our northern border, while not discussed a lot, is wide open, because 
this country doesn't have a border. In Montana, this administration 
can't even prevent a balloon. So the evidence is clear, compelling, and 
not in dispute. The lack of action, willful blindness, and willingness 
to do nothing is deserving of no less than impeachment.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas is doing 
his job with the resources allotted by this Congress. Not only has no 
administration detained all border crossers, but Congress has never 
appropriated sufficient resources to detain all individuals who should 
be detained under the Republicans' reading of the law.
  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, this impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas is a sham. 
The process was a sham. The charges are a sham.
  You might wonder, if that is the case, then why go through all of 
this trouble?
  Well, last November, a colleague of mine from the State of Texas 
stood up in this Chamber and asked for one meaningful accomplishment 
that the Republican Congress has accomplished this session.
  The answer was nothing. That colleague was not a Democrat on this 
side of the aisle, but a Republican--a Republican, who asked the 
question whether somebody could name one meaningful accomplishment.

[[Page H468]]

  Therefore, the answer to my question: Why does this happen? When you 
have no record of accomplishment to run on--nothing on education, 
nothing on healthcare, nothing about creating jobs, nothing on the 
environment, nothing about keeping people safe--this is what you do. 
You put on a circus, and that is why we are here today.
  If we need an example, let's look to the last few days. For years, 
Republicans have used immigrants as political scarecrows. They are 
using them like scarecrows to put up in the face of Americans and scare 
Americans that every single one of these people, including the 6-year-
old children, are coming to harm you and hurt you.
  Since my Republican colleagues have no positive policy solutions, 
they sell that really hard. You hear it on every radio interview, every 
television interview. You hear it from the people in here. You hear it 
on television on FOX News. Every single place, these people are used to 
scare Americans. That is how Republicans want to win.
  That is why we are here, because there is nothing else--nothing else 
left.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have claimed that we need to secure the border. Even when President 
Biden made the comment that he would be willing to shut down the border 
because it is overwhelmed, the Republican Speaker says that proposal--
which would allow for what Republicans have been asking for, supposedly 
for years--is dead on arrival. The Republicans are not going to do it.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a show trial. It is a sham.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Ezell).
  Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress, I spent 8 years as 
a sheriff in my home county and 42 years as a law enforcement officer. 
If I hadn't done my job as a sheriff, I would have been fired and 
removed from office.
  Mr. Speaker, Secretary Mayorkas has not done his job. He has 
willfully ignored immigration laws passed by Congress and allowed our 
southern border to turn into utter chaos.
  His breach of public trust cannot go unanswered. I voted to hold him 
accountable in committee last week, and I will do so today on the 
floor.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this 
impeachment and hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable for his actions.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan).
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I rise to oppose this baseless, politically driven impeachment of 
Secretary Mayorkas by extreme MAGA Republicans.
  House Republicans have failed to meet the constitutional standard for 
impeachment and have failed to provide evidence for high crimes and 
misdemeanors because no evidence exists.
  Republicans rant about the challenges at the southern border, and 
their only solution is to remove the person who has been in the room 
trying to work on a bipartisan basis to get tough on border policies 
that I don't even agree with. Republicans are not serious about border 
security. This is all about politics for my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle.
  House Republicans have consistently opposed legislation to increase 
funding for more Border Patrol agents at the southern border, more 
Customs and Border Protection, more money to combat fentanyl from 
coming across the southern border, something Republicans love to talk 
about, but they want to give no resources to make sure that it is not 
coming over.
  Of course, they have even said no to a billion dollars in ICE 
detention beds. This is a Republican talking point, and they have said 
no to this, too.
  So why are we wasting floor time on political games with a fact-free 
impeachment resolution instead of legislation to improve the lives of 
Americans?
  It is because House Republicans can't govern. They want to distract 
from their weekly embarrassments. Their own Members admit they have not 
accomplished anything.
  Mr. Speaker, this sham impeachment is not an accomplishment. It is 
just another embarrassment because they are a do-nothing Congress.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much 
time is remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 12\1/2\ 
minutes remaining. The gentleman from Mississippi has 12 minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  I will address some of the, at a minimum, misinformation that has 
been provided by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This 
notion that Republicans have somehow cut Border Patrol is absolutely 
false.
  In fact, it has been the administration that has brought decreasing 
budget requests, for example, for ICE detention beds every single year, 
and we wound up giving them more than they asked for.
  Our bill, H.R. 2, actually would provide 3,000 new Border Patrol 
agents, and the supplemental request by the President asks for 
approximately 1,400. You can't say we are resourcing less when we are 
actually providing numbers for more. That is just disinformation. It is 
false.
  This notion that seizures are up, if you pour more water through a 
small pipe, there is more volume coming at the fence. They are going to 
seize more. I get that. However, tell me why the price for a hit of 
fentanyl on the street in Tennessee went from $95 a hit when this 
President took office to $28 a hit.
  It is because of the supply and demand of fentanyl. It is the supply 
and demand curve. That is because it is pouring across our southern 
border. It is pouring across our southern border because the cartels 
are jamming folks through the crossing sites. The Border Patrol agents 
are having to move off the border to cover that, and we have a wide-
open southern border.
  We have shown this in our five-phases investigation, videos of 
camouflage-wearing, carpet-shoe-wearing people with backpacks full of 
drugs coming through the remote parts of the country or the border. To 
suggest that just because seizures are up somebody is doing their job, 
that is meaningless.
  I want to make a point here, because several people have said, if we 
were concerned about border protection, we would bring up the Senate 
negotiated bill. Well, I thought the Senate had to pass it before we 
could bring it up. I haven't heard that the bill has even passed 
the Senate. Therefore, this accusation that we somehow aren't for 
Border Patrol because we haven't taken up this bill is false because it 
hasn't even passed the Senate yet.

  I heard someone say Mr. Mayorkas has done his job. The last poll I 
saw indicated approximately 85 percent of Americans think the Secretary 
is failing, but, yes, keep singing that song.
  Rushed? We have been at this for almost a year.
  One gentleman said: No court has actually ruled that Mr. Mayorkas is 
breaking the law.
  The Fifth Circuit court absolutely ruled it. Then the gentleman who 
mentioned that actually said that the Supreme Court overturned that.
  No, they didn't. They decided they weren't going to decide. They 
said: We don't have standing here, or you don't have standing here, so 
their case technically wasn't even heard. They said: You don't have 
standing. Have a nice day.
  To suggest that that was overturned, the Fifth Circuit court's ruling 
on the lawlessness of this Secretary, is just wrong. It is wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
Guest).
  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I want to push back.
  What is happening here is not political theater, as my friends on the 
other side of the aisle wish to make this.
  The Democrats have sought to blame Republicans, saying that our 
inaction has helped cause this border crisis, but I will tell you that 
nothing is farther from the truth. Almost a year ago, this body passed 
H.R. 2, a border security bill, a border security bill that would find 
a record number of Customs and

[[Page H469]]

Border Patrol agents, a bill which would give raises to those men and 
women who were there on the front lines trying to secure our border, a 
bill which would invest in technology to stop the flow of illegal drugs 
coming across our border, a bill which would have restarted wall 
construction.
  That bill, for almost a year, has sat in the other Chamber, has sat 
in the Senate, and Mr. Schumer has refused to bring that bill to the 
floor.

                              {time}  1645

  This body also passed the Homeland Security appropriations bill, 
giving the Department of Homeland Security more money than that 
Department has ever received. We funded those additional agents. We 
funded those pay raises. We funded additional detention beds. What has 
happened to that appropriations bill? It also sits in the Senate 
waiting for the Senate to take action.
  Today, my friends across the aisle seek to hide behind this Senate 
bill that was crafted behind closed doors, in the cover of darkness, a 
bill that did not include any input from the House of Representatives, 
did not include Homeland Security Chair Mark Green or Ranking Member 
Bennie Thompson from Mississippi. Three Senators out of 100 got behind 
closed doors for weeks, and they sat down and crafted a bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Mississippi.
  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, with no input on behalf of the House of 
Representatives, we are now supposed to adopt that bill before it even 
passes the Senate.
  I want to give you a number, Mr. Speaker. That number is 370,000. 
That is the number of immigrants who came into our country last month 
alone. That is not a year; that is not 6 months; that is a single 
month, 370,000 people, yet our Homeland Security Secretary continues to 
maintain that the border is secure.
  My friends across the aisle seek to blame Republicans for this 
crisis. I will tell you that their blame is misplaced. If they want to 
blame someone for what is happening on the southwest border, they need 
to look in the mirror. They need to look at what their Secretary has 
done, and they need to look at what their President has done. They can 
no longer blame Republicans for their failures.
  I will close with this, Mr. Speaker. If we are unable to hold 
Secretary Mayorkas accountable for his failures, for his failure to 
enforce the law, we can hold no one accountable. Secretary Mayorkas 
must be impeached.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, the administration is 
enforcing the law. ICE is currently detaining over 38,000 people. This 
is 4,000 more than Congress has provided funding for. If Republicans 
want DHS to detain more people, they should provide the funds the 
administration has asked for in the supplemental request.
  Under former President Trump, Republicans cheered the doubling of 
drug seizures. Now, they view it as a problem. This is hypocrisy at its 
finest.
  Under Secretary Mayorkas' leadership, DHS has seized more fentanyl 
and arrested more criminals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last 2 
years than in the previous 5 years. This impeachment has been a 
preplanned political stunt from the beginning.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New York Times article 
detailing how Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green promised 
donors that the House would impeach Secretary Mayorkas prior to 
launching any type of inquiry. He said: ``Get the popcorn.''

                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2023]

   Key Republican Tells Donors He Will Pursue Impeachment of Mayorkas

                         (By Karoun Demirjian)

       Washington.--The Republican chairman of the House Homeland 
     Security Committee promised donors this month that he would 
     produce an impeachment case against the Biden 
     administration's homeland security chief, Alejandro N. 
     Mayorkas, saying that the secretary's appearance before the 
     panel this week would be the beginning of his demise.
       Representative Mark E. Green told an enthusiastic crowd in 
     his home state of Tennessee last week that his committee 
     would expose Mr. Mayorkas's ``dereliction of duty and his 
     intentional destruction of our country through the open 
     southern border.'' He said the panel would deliver charges to 
     the House Judiciary Committee, which handles impeachment 
     proceedings, according to an audio recording of a House 
     Freedom Caucus fund-raiser obtained by The New York Times.
       He said he had a ``five-phase plan'' for doing so and that 
     the Homeland Security Committee would ``put together a 
     packet, and we will hand it to Jim Jordan and let Jim do what 
     Jim does best.''
       Mr. Green apparently was referring to Representative Jim 
     Jordan, the Ohio Republican who leads the Judiciary panel. 
     His comments made clear that G.O.P. leaders are serious about 
     their threats to impeach Mr. Mayorkas. He said the plan would 
     start with an appearance by the secretary before his 
     committee on Wednesday.
       On April 19, next week, get the popcorn--Alejandro Mayorkas 
     comes before our committee, and it's going to be fun,'' Mr. 
     Green told the room, adding: ``That'll really be just the 
     beginning for him.''
       A spokeswoman for Mr. Green did not respond to requests for 
     comment.
       Mr. Green and other Republican leaders have made no secret 
     of their desire to pursue impeachment charges against Mr. 
     Mayorkas. Speaker Kevin McCarthy began threatening to impeach 
     him months before Mr. McCarthy won his gavel. But their 
     ambitions have been limited thus far by the political 
     realities of the House; not every Republican wants to 
     demonize Mr. Mayorkas as solely responsible for the country's 
     immigration problems, and with a slim majority, party leaders 
     do not yet have the votes to impeach him.
       As a result, Mr. Green and other House Republicans in 
     positions of authority have been careful to avoid promising 
     publicly that they would find evidence against Mr. Mayorkas 
     worthy of prosecution. Behind closed doors with core 
     supporters, however, Mr. Green was less cautious, using the 
     issue to whip up the crowd.
       During a public session on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before 
     the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, 
     Republicans hammered Mr. Mayorkas both for the border 
     situation and for recent revelations, documented in an 
     investigation by The New York Times, that unaccompanied 
     migrant children have been exploited as laborers. Both 
     Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Josh Hawley of Missouri 
     demanded that the secretary resign.
       Mr. Mayorkas pushed back, saying his department was not 
     responsible for the child labor crisis.
       ``You are incorrectly attributing it to our policies,'' he 
     told Mr. Hawley. He also disputed the idea that he could be 
     held personally responsible for the problems at the border, 
     telling senators: ``Our asylum system is broken, our entire 
     immigration system is broken, and in desperate need of 
     reform--and it's been so for years and years.''
       The Department of Homeland Security has dismissed calls for 
     Mr. Mayorkas to step down as ``baseless'' and ``reckless,'' 
     and Mr. Mayorkas has suggested in past interviews that the 
     efforts to impeach him were simply a way of turbocharging 
     policy disputes with the administration.
       Mr. Green made his comments at an event billed as a 
     ``V.I.P. Reception and Conversation with Conservative 
     Heroes,'' where he appeared behind closed doors alongside Mr. 
     Jordan and other hard-right Republicans. He pointed to recent 
     testimony before his panel by Raul L. Ortiz, the Border 
     Patrol chief, who detailed ``an increase in flow'' in five of 
     the nine sectors along the U.S.-Mexico border and said it had 
     ``caused a considerable strain on our resources.''
       He also recalled Mr. Ortiz's testimony that the United 
     States does not have ``operational control'' of the southern 
     border, which Republicans seized on to accuse Mr. Mayorkas, 
     who had testified that the border is secure, of dishonesty. 
     Mr. Mayorkas addressed the apparent discrepancy during a 
     separate hearing last month, telling senators that he was 
     using a different definition of ``operational security,'' and 
     that the two statements were not in conflict.
       Mr. Green nonetheless trumpeted Mr. Ortiz's words as a kill 
     shot against Mr. Mayorkas, telling the donors that ``he'll 
     see that video a couple of times'' during the upcoming 
     hearing before the Homeland Security panel.
       The secretary's appearances on Capitol Hill this week come 
     as the Republican House is barreling ahead with what Mr. 
     Green told donors would be ``the most conservative border 
     security bill that this Congress has ever seen, or any 
     Congress has ever seen.'' The panel is expected to debate 
     that bill next week.
       On Wednesday, while Mr. Mayorkas is testifying before the 
     Homeland Security panel, the Judiciary Committee is scheduled 
     to debate a second border security bill aimed at restricting 
     migrant inflows, including by restricting access to asylum 
     and requiring all employers to adopt an electronic system 
     that screens prospective employees' eligibility to work.

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I think that most of my colleagues here and a lot of 
people back home certainly know that I had the unbelievable privilege 
to interview Saddam Hussein on the night of his capture.
  As I was sitting there talking to Saddam Hussein, I asked him why he 
invaded Kuwait. He gave me all these

justifications about who owned which oil field. Then he held up the 
palm of his hand and he pointed to the palm of his hand and said: All 
human civilization is from the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers. Every 
person on the planet is an Iraqi, and I am the President of Iraq.
  What Saddam Hussein was saying was he was the king of the world. The 
thought struck me: How does a person get there? Well, the old adage 
came to mind that absolute power corrupts absolutely. When you 
concentrate power into the hands of fewer and fewer people, you get 
tyranny every time. In this case, one man.
  Our Founders were brilliant. They were following the philosophies of 
Montesquieu, and they decided they would divide power out; they would 
separate three branch of government. Then with the 10th Amendment, they 
would separate power between the Federal Government, the States, and 
the local governments. They did develop three equal and separate 
branches of government, with the legislative branch writing the laws 
and the executive branch executing the laws.
  Interestingly enough, in the Iran-Contra hearing, the Democrats said 
in their report: You can't pick and choose which law you want to 
enforce. It is also fascinating that here we are and they say it is 
about policy. This is about a systemic, planned mechanism to undo the 
immigration laws passed before, just because the current Secretary 
doesn't think that is what they ought to be.
  This Secretary is supposed to execute those laws, but he has chosen 
not to. It says, shall detain criminal felons, and he has directed his 
DHS employees not to do that, violating the laws passed by this body, 
telling this separate but equal branch of government: I don't care what 
you say or have passed as law. I don't care that you represent the 
voice of the American people. I am the guy who knows the best way to do 
it, and I am going to do it my way. That is the road to tyranny, that 
is power in one man's hands, and that is not what our Constitution says 
it is supposed to be.
  He took an oath to that Constitution to defend that Constitution that 
says this branch writes, that branch executes. He has violated his oath 
of office. He has subverted the laws that this body has passed and, 
thus, basically said: I don't care about the Congress. That is 
unacceptable. Whether he were a Republican or a Democrat standing that 
way, I would be here today doing everything I could to remove him from 
office.
  When I was 17, I took an oath to that Constitution for the first time 
and served for 24 years, willing to take a bullet for that Constitution 
and the people of this country. I will not stand idly by while he 
throws it in the garbage.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time for closing.
  Even some House Republicans have acknowledged that there is no 
constitutional basis for impeachment. Representative McClintock called 
this effort an unconstitutional abuse of power and reckless, partisan, 
and unserious. Representative Buck said: It is not an impeachable 
offense. This is a policy difference.
  Mr. Speaker, besides failing to articulate a single cognizable charge 
that would meet the constitutional impeachment standard of high crimes 
and misdemeanors, this sham impeachment has been marred by procedural 
failures.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record documentation of those 
procedural failures.
                                   Committee on Homeland Security,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2024.
     Hon. Mark E. Green,
     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: Your ill-advised decision to rush to a 
     markup of an impeachment resolution of Secretary Alejandro 
     Mayorkas without any form of due process or Democrats' 
     properly requested minority-day hearing is disappointing yet 
     expected.
       Nothing about this sham impeachment has abided by House 
     precedent, but all of it has been done to reach the 
     predetermined outcome you promised your donors last year.
       1. This impeachment inquiry was not authorized by the full 
     House. Until this Congress, Republicans have railed against 
     pursuing impeachment without formal authorization by the full 
     House. The last time a Cabinet official was impeached--the 
     1876 case of Secretary of War William W. Belknap--the full 
     House authorized several committees to investigate well-
     publicized cases of fraud in the Federal Government. In this 
     case, however, the full House was not permitted to debate the 
     merits (or lack thereof) of impeaching Secretary Mayorkas or 
     consider the proper procedures for any such investigation.
       2. Secretary Mayorkas was not afforded any rights in the 
     absence of an authorized impeachment inquiry. Authorizing 
     resolutions not only imbue investigative committees with 
     additional authority and legitimacy, but they also afford 
     subjects of such investigations the ability to respond to the 
     investigation. When the House authorized its impeachment 
     inquiry into former President Donald Trump during the 116th 
     Congress, for example, House Resolution 660 authorized the 
     Committee on the Judiciary to adopt rules allowing for the 
     participation of the President and his counsel. In the 
     Belknap impeachment, the committee of primary jurisdiction 
     ``gave [Belknap] opportunity to explain, present witnesses, 
     and cross-examine witnesses.'' No such rights were afforded 
     to Secretary Mayorkas.
       3. Secretary Mayorkas was not afforded the opportunity to 
     testify before the Committee despite his willingness to do 
     so. Secretary Mayorkas has testified at congressional 
     hearings 27 times during his tenure--more than any other 
     Cabinet secretary. The Secretary said he would ``make himself 
     available'' to testify before the House Homeland Security 
     Committee, but you refused to accommodate his request and 
     find a mutually agreeable date. Instead, on January 18, 2024, 
     you offered the Secretary the opportunity to include written 
     testimony for the record of that day's hearing. The window to 
     submit such testimony will still be open by the time the 
     Committee proceeds to markup a resolution impeaching him on 
     Tuesday, January 30, 2024.
       4. Democrats' properly entered minority-day hearing request 
     will not be acted upon prior to the markup of an impeachment 
     resolution. At the January 18, 2024 Committee hearing, I 
     furnished you with a timely demand for a minority-day 
     hearing, signed by all Democratic Members of the Committee, 
     pursuant to clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
     U.S. House of Representatives. The rule is clear: ``[T]he 
     minority members of the committee shall be entitled . . . to 
     call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with 
     respect to that measure or matter during at least one day of 
     hearing thereon.'' When presented with that demand, however, 
     you erroneously said, ``So as I understand the rules, the 
     request is only in order when you don't have a witness 
     present and today, you have a witness present, so this not 
     [in] order.''
       Nothing in the text of the rule supports that assertion. 
     Indeed, as I pointed out during our exchange, the rule states 
     the precise opposite: ``Although a majority of the minority 
     members of a committee are entitled to call witnesses 
     selected by the minority for at least one day of hearings, no 
     rule of the House requires the calling of witnesses on 
     opposing sides of an issue.'' The Chair is required to 
     schedule a minority-day hearing. Having a witness selected by 
     the Minority at a hearing does not preclude the request for a 
     minority-day hearing under rule XI.
       Democrats intended to call additional Constitutional and 
     legal experts to continue to inform the Committee of the lack 
     of any grounds to proceed with the impeachment of Secretary 
     Mayorkas. Indeed, even frequent Republican impeachment expert 
     Jonathan Turley thinks that Secretary Mayorkas has not 
     committed an impeachable offense. The impeachment resolution 
     will proceed to markup without this hearing required under 
     House rules and the benefit of such testimony.
       5. The Committee was used as a platform for Members to 
     campaign for other office. In blatant disregard for the House 
     Code of Official Conduct (House rule XXIII) and chapter 4 of 
     the House Ethics Manual, a Republican Member referenced his 
     campaign for State attorney general during his questioning 
     of hearing witnesses on January 10, 2024. As I pointed out 
     to you at the time, ``I just ask that if [the Member is] 
     going to run just go run, just don't run when the 
     committee is in session.'' This violation of ethical 
     standards underscores the political nature of this entire 
     impeachment farce: it bears no relationship to the 
     Constitution or whether Secretary Mayorkas has committed 
     an impeachable offense.
       Despite these obvious defects and departures from 
     precedent, the Committee will regrettably proceed to a markup 
     of an impeachment resolution next week.
       This unserious impeachment is a testament to partisan 
     politics over rules and reason. Just two legal experts 
     testified before the Committee, and both participated at the 
     invitation of Democrats. Both of these distinguished scholars 
     plainly stated that the Constitution did not support the 
     impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas. Given the grave importance 
     of impeachment--which you once described as ``probably the 
     most extreme remedy that our constitution affords for taking 
     someone out of office''--this Committee should do better. At 
     the very least, it should follow the rules and practices 
     established over more than two centuries of congressional 
     history.
       In 1788, Alexander Hamilton wrote: ``In many cases 
     [impeachment] will connect

[[Page H471]]

     itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all 
     their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on 
     one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always 
     be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated 
     more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real 
     demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''
       In the inept and inappropriate ways you have handled the 
     Committee during this partisan sham, you have proven Hamilton 
     correct.
           Sincerely,
                                               Bennie G. Thompson,

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, the statements from the 
other side this afternoon have misrepresented the facts and the laws of 
this baseless, sham impeachment.
  This extreme MAGA Republican majority is more about stunts rather 
than solutions. This political stunt is about placating extreme 
elements within the Republican Conference rather than doing what is 
right for America, because it is clear that Republicans have failed to 
make the case for impeachment. They have failed to articulate a single 
high crime and misdemeanor. The other side of the aisle wreaks of 
desperation.
  Sadly, many Republicans appear willing to undermine the Constitution 
they claim to hold dear to score cheap political points. I am holding 
out hope that some of my colleagues across the aisle will do the right 
thing, that they will join us in upholding the oath we all swore to the 
Constitution.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H. Res. 863. Vote ``no'' 
on this sham impeachment.
  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a 
detailed rebuttal of this sham impeachment in a letter to the House 
Rules Committee. I include in the Record an extract of the legal 
analysis of the Department. The full letter can be found at

         Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of 
           Homeland Security,
                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2024.
     Chairman Tom Cole,
     Ranking Member Jim McGovern,
     House Committee on Rules,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Cole and Ranking Member McGovern: We write in 
     connection with House Resolution 863 (the ``Resolution''), 
     which was introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene 
     and approved along partisan lines by the Committee on 
     Homeland Security (the ``Committee''). The Resolution 
     contains two articles impeaching Secretary Mayorkas.
       Passage of this Resolution by the House of Representatives 
     would be unconstitutional. The effort to impeach Secretary 
     Mayorkas represents a dramatic departure from over two 
     centuries of established understanding and precedent about 
     the meaning of the Impeachment Clause of the Constitution and 
     the proper exercise of that extraordinary tool. In addition 
     to lacking any basis in the Constitution, the impeachment 
     articles reflect a basic misrepresentation of key statutes 
     governing immigration law. Contrary to the Resolution's 
     charges, the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS'' or the 
     ``Department'') under Secretary Mayorkas's leadership has 
     always followed the law in good faith, and any suggestion 
     otherwise is false.


                      I. Introduction and Summary

       This letter explains why the proposed impeachment of 
     Secretary Mayorkas is illegitimate, invalid, and dangerous. 
     It proceeds in three parts. Part I describes the broad and 
     overwhelming consensus that the constitutional standard for 
     impeachment--``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
     Misdemeanors''--does not encompass mere disagreements with 
     policy decisions made in good faith or the lawful exercise of 
     enforcement discretion. Both the Constitution's text and the 
     Framers' explicit intent make clear that impeachment is not a 
     lawful remedy for partisan disputes, nor is it a permissible 
     means for Congress to voice its disapproval of how a Cabinet 
     Secretary is furthering the Administration's policies. 
     Indeed, Congress has twice rejected proposals to impeach 
     Executive Branch officials based on partisan disagreement 
     with their immigration enforcement decisions.
       Part II explains why the effort to impeach the Secretary 
     lacks any basis in law and consists only of a thinly-veiled 
     dispute about border security and immigration policy. While 
     the Resolution has charged the Secretary in Article I with 
     ``willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,'' 
     there is no legal or factual basis for that allegation. At 
     its core, the Article is nothing more than a simple list of 
     criticisms of the policies of the current Administration. 
     These assertions do not meet the Constitutional standard for 
     impeachment. The Secretary has followed the law in good faith 
     in each and every action that the Resolution cites as a 
     purported ground for impeachment, whether related to asylum, 
     detention, removals, parole processes, or any others. All of 
     those decisions find ample support in existing provisions of 
     the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). To the extent 
     Congress wants to change the Administration's policies, the 
     Constitution prescribes a different path: passing 
     legislation. In fact, the Secretary has worked for months 
     with Members of Congress from both parties to seek bipartisan 
     legislation--the draft of which was released yesterday--to 
     help solve the challenges faced at the border. There has been 
     no ``refusal to comply with the law,'' much less the kind of 
     deliberate malfeasance or personal corruption that the 
     Constitution requires for the extraordinary remedy of 
     impeachment.
       Finally, Part III addresses the hodgepodge of claims under 
     Resolution Article II, entitled ``Breach of Public Trust.'' 
     That Article claims that the Secretary made false statements 
     about ``operational control'' or border security, that he 
     inappropriately reversed Trump-era immigration policies, and 
     that he failed to comply with unidentified Congressional 
     subpoenas. These conclusory assertions are false, and the 
     Resolution provides no support for them. As detailed below, 
     the Secretary has not made false statements about conditions 
     at the border but rather transparently provided his opinions 
     about border security. His reversal of certain earlier 
     immigration policies is the result of a change of 
     Administrations, not a breach of the public's trust. And he 
     has not failed to comply with subpoenas or other oversight; 
     under his leadership, DHS has been extraordinarily 
     cooperative with Congress. It is the Committee, not the 
     Secretary, that has departed from regular order by abandoning 
     established standards and procedures that have characterized 
     every relevant impeachment effort in this Nation's history.
       Impeachment in these circumstances, and on this record, 
     would represent a radical and dangerous step in violation of 
     the Constitution. Taken to its logical conclusion, it would 
     alter the balance between the Legislative and Executive 
     Branches and would disrupt the relationship between a 
     President and his or her Cabinet. The House of 
     Representatives should reject the proposed Articles of 
     Impeachment.


 Impeachment Based on Partisan Policy Disputes is Unconstitutional and 
                             Unprecedented

       Under the Constitution, impeachment is an extraordinary 
     measure limited to ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
     and Misdemeanors.'' Although the Resolution alleges a 
     ``Willful and Systemic Refusal to Comply with the Law'' and 
     ``Breach of Public Trust,'' there is no basis to support 
     either Article. To the contrary, the entire Resolution 
     reduces to an expression of disagreement with and disapproval 
     of the Secretary's good-faith policy decisions, judgments, 
     and opinions about how best to pursue the Administration's 
     policy choices on border security and immigration enforcement 
     within legal bounds. Disagreement with an Administration's 
     policy positions and opinions is not a valid basis to impeach 
     a Cabinet Secretary, whose job is to execute those policies. 
     Constitutional text, historical precedent, and the 
     overwhelming body of scholarship--including every 
     Constitutional scholar who testified before the Committee and 
     dozens of others who have commented publicly on these 
     proceedings--confirm that impeachment of the Secretary in 
     these circumstances would be unconstitutional, unprecedented, 
     and destabilizing.


   The Framers Established a High Bar for Impeachment That Does Not 
                     Encompass Policy Disagreements

       The Framers carefully erected a high bar for impeachment, 
     deliberately rejecting the more liberal use of that tool that 
     had characterized British Parliamentary practice. The Framers 
     specifically limited impeachment to a narrow set of 
     intentional and grave crimes against the public that could 
     undermine the constitutional order. In adopting the phrase 
     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as grounds for impeachment, 
     the Framers first considered, and squarely rejected, a lower 
     standard that would have encompassed less severe offenses 
     such as ``malpractice,'' ``neglect of duty,'' and 
     ``maladministration.'' The Framers thereby sought to prevent 
     impeachment from becoming a mere partisan weapon that could 
     be

[[Page H472]]

     used to supplant the President's policies for those favored 
     by the legislature. As the Constitution's text, the Founding 
     debates, and overwhelming weight of expert opinion make 
     clear, impeachment is not an appropriate means for Congress 
     to express disagreement with an official's exercise of his 
     duties or the policies he pursues. Rather, the Framers 
     determined that impeachable conduct would consist only of the 
     most serious intentional wrongdoing that regular elections 
     could not adequately remedy.


    The Constitution's Text Makes Clear That Policy and Enforcement 
           Decisions Are Not ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors''

       Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution limits Congress's 
     power to impeach the President, Vice President and, as 
     relevant here, officer of the United States to: ``Treason, 
     Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Because 
     Secretary Mayorkas has not been accused of either treason or 
     bribery, any article of impeachment against him must 
     establish that he committed ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' 
     The Framers of the Constitution intended that this term of 
     art encompass a narrow set of ``great'' and ``dangerous'' 
     crimes against the public characterized by serious and 
     intentional ``abuses of official power.'' That was the kind 
     of ``breach of the public trust,'' in which the office-holder 
     pursued some illegitimate interest over his duty to country, 
     that the Framers deemed worthy of impeachment.
       The Framers recognized treason and bribery as the most 
     serious offenses one could commit against the constitutional 
     system of government. The use of the word ``other'' before 
     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' signaled that this category 
     comprises only those offenses that are similar to ``treason'' 
     and ``bribery'' both in kind and degree. Any impeachable 
     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must involve an act of 
     deliberate malfeasance as serious and damaging to the 
     constitutional order as betraying the Nation in exchange for 
     personal gain, ``not merely a mistake in judgment or policy 
     or partisan differences.''


   The Framers Rejected ``Maladministration'' and Good-Faith Policy 
                  Disputes as a Basis for Impeachment

       While American impeachment practice has roots in the 
     British Parliamentary system, the Framers intentionally 
     rejected the lower impeachment standard that system applied. 
     Consistent with the separation of powers established in the 
     Constitution, the Framers rejected ``maladministration'' as 
     grounds for impeachment, instead requiring deliberate and 
     egregious misconduct. The Framers thereby sought to prevent 
     Congress from employing impeachment as a mere political tool 
     that could subordinate the Executive to the will of Congress.
       The Framers adapted the concept of impeachment from the 
     British Parliament, which first employed impeachment 
     procedures in the fourteenth century as a legislative check 
     against disfavored royal ministers. Because the hereditary 
     monarchy wielded absolute power that insulated it from direct 
     criticism, Parliaments dissatisfied with a monarch's policies 
     devised a method for removing ministers charged with carrying 
     out royal policies by alleging that the ministers were 
     incompetent or malicious in the execution of their duties. In 
     practice, this broad standard meant royal ministers served at 
     the pleasure of Parliament. Parliament's impeachment power 
     was limited to instances typically involving an abuse of 
     power exercised either through corruption or 
     maladministration. Because there was no formal codification 
     of the term, however, British officials were impeached for a 
     wide variety of misdeeds, ranging from personal corruption 
     and the commission of crimes to neglect of duty and even 
     providing bad advice.
       Against this historical backdrop, the Framers debated 
     whether to adopt the British use of ``high crimes and 
     misdemeanors'' but decided to narrow it to willful and 
     egregious abuses of power. Under the resulting American 
     formulation, good-faith policy decisions or the exercise of 
     discretion do not constitute impeachable conduct.
       Initially, some delegates to the Constitutional Convention 
     proposed that the Constitution provide for impeachment in 
     cases of ``mal-practice or neglect of duty.'' That language 
     was rejected in favor of the phrase ``treason, bribery, or 
     corruption,'' a revision that ``seemed to exclude mere 
     mismanagement or incompetence.'' George Mason then proposed 
     adding ``maladministration'' as a basis for impeachment. The 
     delegates also rejected that formulation, believing ``[a]n 
     election of every four years will prevent 
     maladministration.'' James Madison added that if the 
     Constitution made ``maladministration'' impeachable, ``[s]o 
     vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure 
     of the Senate'' rather than allowing officials to serve out 
     their terms and execute the policies that they were elected 
     to pursue. In other words, ``maladministration'' would create 
     an impeachment standard more analogous to the British 
     Parliamentary system. It would thereby subject the Executive 
     Branch to the will of Congress and allow for the removal of 
     the President or other Executive Branch officials for a wide 
     range of common transgressions, including ``inefficient 
     administration, or administration that did not accord with 
     Congress's view of good policy.'' Having created a government 
     executive power that, unlike the monarch in Britain, was 
     answerable to the voters, they concluded the impeachment 
     power should and need not be available for mere policy 
     differences or failure to perform the job adequately. The 
     Framers thus established that ``high Crimes and 
     Misdemeanors'' would not encompass mere 
     ``maladministration.''
       Additional historical records indicate that impeachment is 
     reserved for conduct characterized by intentional or 
     purposeful wrongdoing. For example, during the Virginia 
     Ratifying Convention, Edmund Randolph remarked that even in 
     England, ``[n]o man ever thought of impeaching a man for an 
     opinion.''
       Scholars across the ideological spectrum agree that the 
     ``Framers' rejection of `maladministration' as a basis for 
     impeachment was, in effect, a rejection of a standard'' that 
     lacked prerequisites such as bad faith or corrupt intent. As 
     Professor Charles Black explained in his seminal treatment of 
     impeachment, ``certainly the phrase `high Crimes and 
     Misdemeanors,' whatever its vagueness at the edges, seems 
     absolutely to forbid the removal of a president on the 
     grounds that Congress does not on the whole think his 
     administration of public affairs is good.'' Thus, ``whatever 
     may be the grounds for impeachment and removal, dislike of a 
     president's policy is definitely not one of them, and ought 
     to play no part in the decision on impeachment.'' Likewise, 
     impeachment scholar Professor Michael Gerhardt observed, 
     following a comprehensive review of historical impeachment 
     precedent, that the Senate has ``concluded that impeachable 
     offenses do not include errors of judgment or policy 
     differences.'' Professor Keith Whittington similarly 
     concluded that the adoption of the phrase ``high crimes and 
     misdemeanors'' ``seemed to capture the range of potential 
     dangers that concerned Madison and others, without leaving 
     the president vulnerable to impeachment over routine 
     political and policy disagreements.''
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, Homeland Security Committee 
Chairman Mark Green denied Secretary Mayorkas the ability to testify 
during the committee's sham impeachment ``investigation.'' Secretary 
Mayorkas, however, wrote the Chairman to set the record straight. I 
include in the Record the Secretary's January 30, 2024, letter to 
Chairman Green.
                                                U.S. Department of


                                            Homeland Security,

                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2024.
     Hon. Mark E. Green,
     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Green: On January 5, 2024, you sent a letter 
     to me requesting that I again appear before the House 
     Homeland Security Committee to provide testimony. I have 
     testified before this Committee seven times. I agreed to 
     testify again and asked to work with your staff to identify a 
     mutually agreeable date. You did not respond to my request, 
     changed course, and instead invited me to submit written 
     testimony. Two days later, you issued a statement 
     representing that every member of the Committee's majority 
     already had rendered their decision. I respectfully submit 
     this letter in response.
       The problems with our broken and outdated immigration 
     system are not new. I assumed office in February 2021. 
     Immigration cases concluded that year reportedly had been 
     languishing in court for an average of 1,319 days. In 2010, 
     that average was 347 days. The Department of Justice's 
     Executive Office for Immigration Review reports that at the 
     end of Fiscal Year 2020, there were 1,261,144 cases in the 
     immigration court backlog. In 2017 that number was 656,383. 
     The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics reported that there 
     were approximately 11.4 million undocumented individuals 
     present in the United States in 2018. Our immigration laws 
     last received an overhaul in 1996. Our immigration laws were 
     simply not built for 21st century migration patterns.
       In 2019, prior to the onset of COVID and as country 
     conditions in Latin America were on the decline, the number 
     of migrants encountered at our Southwest Border increased 
     almost 100 percent over the prior year. In this post-COVID 
     period, the challenges at our border have again intensified 
     as the world experiences the greatest displacement of people 
     since World War II and our entire hemisphere is gripped with 
     mass migration brought on by violence, food insecurity, 
     severe poverty, corruption, authoritarian regimes, and the 
     destruction of homes and communities by extreme weather 
     events. These movements are facilitated by human smuggling 
     organizations that exploit migrants as part of a billion-
     dollar criminal enterprise. The depth of suffering that 
     migrants are willing to endure speaks to the desperation they 
     feel about their prospects at home.
       We need a legislative solution and only Congress can 
     provide it. I have been privileged to join a bipartisan group 
     of United States Senators these past several months to 
     provide technical and operational expertise in support of 
     their efforts to strengthen our country's border security. 
     These efforts would yield significant new enforcement tools 
     and make a substantial difference at our border.
       Our law enforcement personnel need additional resources to 
     execute our border security and enforcement strategy, which 
     is why the Administration requested supplemental funding in 
     August and then again in October 2023. That request included 
     the hiring of an additional 1,300 Border Patrol Agents, 1,000 
     law enforcement officers and the purchase and deployment of 
     over 100 cutting-edge

[[Page H473]]

     Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems to prevent cartels 
     from moving fentanyl into the country, and 1,600 additional 
     asylum officers to rapidly adjudicate claims for asylum and 
     facilitate timely decisions so that those who are ineligible 
     can be quickly removed and those with valid claims can 
     receive prompt resolution.
       Instead, you claim that we have failed to enforce our 
     immigration laws. That is false. We have provided Congress 
     and your Committee hours of testimony, thousands of 
     documents, hundreds of briefings, and much more information 
     that demonstrates quite clearly how we are enforcing the law. 
     The extensive material we have provided informed you that, 
     for example:
       This Administration has removed, returned, or expelled more 
     migrants in three years than the prior Administration did in 
     four years.
       Since May 12, 2023, DHS has removed or returned more than 
     500,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the 
     Southwest Border.
       Total removals and returns since mid-May 2023 exceed 
     removals and returns in every full fiscal year since 2015.
       Daily removals and returns are nearly double what they were 
     compared to the pre-pandemic average from 2014 to 2019. The 
     majority of individuals encountered at the Southwest Border 
     throughout this Administration have been removed, returned, 
     or expelled.
       We have significantly increased the number of removal 
     flights within the Western Hemisphere since the end of Title 
     42, sending over 20 flights per week of individuals who have 
     been rapidly processed and determined to be removable. We 
     continue to repatriate individuals to more than 150 
     countries.
       Before 2013, the majority of individuals attempting to 
     cross the border entered without being caught. Under this 
     Administration, the estimated annual apprehension rate has 
     averaged 78 percent, the same average rate of apprehension as 
     in the prior Administration.
       We developed and implemented a regulation that created a 
     presumption of ineligibility for asylum if an individual who 
     crossed the Southwest Border without authorization traveled 
     through another country and failed to meet defined criteria, 
     including the use of lawful pathways made available to them.
       We have been executing an unprecedented and high-impact 
     campaign to disrupt and dismantle the smuggling 
     organizations. More than 14,000 smugglers throughout the 
     region have been arrested and thousands have been prosecuted 
     under federal law.
       We have worked with Mexico to conduct mirrored patrols 
     along the Southwest Border, and we have worked with Mexico 
     and other countries to increase interdictions along the 
     migratory routes, increase repatriation flights, and execute 
     the removal of third-country nationals.
       Last year we secured funding to hire 300 more Border Patrol 
     Agents, the first increase in more than a decade. Last year I 
     was honored to promote Jason Owens, a career Border Patrol 
     Agent, as the new Chief of the United States Border Patrol.
       Undoubtedly, we have policy disagreements on the 
     historically divisive issue of immigration. That has been the 
     case between Administrations and Members of Congress for much 
     longer than the past 38 years since the last overhaul of our 
     immigration system. I think it is unconscionable to separate 
     children from their parents as a tool of deterrence. I 
     believe that law enforcement at the border can be tough and 
     humane. It is our responsibility to the American people to 
     work through our differences and try to reach solutions 
     together. The bipartisan group of United States Senators is 
     currently doing just that.
       The trafficking and use of illegal drugs are also not new 
     problems for our country. We have been fighting the war 
     against drugs for decades. When I was working to convict drug 
     dealers and traffickers as a federal prosecutor throughout 
     the 1990s--including the prosecution of the largest cocaine 
     money laundering operation in the country at the time--I saw 
     up close the loss and damage wreaked by black tar heroin, 
     methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and other illegal drugs. I 
     was dedicated then, as I am now, to defeating this scourge 
     upon our country.
       What I saw for twelve years as a federal prosecutor does 
     not compare to what our country has experienced and what we 
     have been fighting for more than the past seven years. The 
     addictiveness and fatality of synthetic opioids have cost 
     hundreds of thousands of lives and have ravaged communities. 
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 
     that overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids--primarily 
     fentanyl--began to climb in 2014 and have accelerated since. 
     Provisional data from the CDC reflects 28,659 overdose deaths 
     involving synthetic opioids in 2017, escalating to 56,894 in 
     2020; 71,143 in 2021; and 74,789 in 2022. Every death from 
     drug overdoses and poisoning is a tragedy.
       The battle against fentanyl presents unique challenges 
     because fentanyl is cheap to make, easily concealed, and made 
     with precursor chemicals and materials that have legal uses. 
     We have intensified our efforts against the cartels and 
     developed new strategies in response. In Fiscal Year 2023 our 
     targeted operations seized more than 43,000 pounds of 
     fentanyl, 3,600 pill presses, and $16 million in currency. We 
     work closely with partners in other countries. Homeland 
     Security Investigations has established 16 Transnational 
     Criminal Investigative Units (TCIUs) that are successfully 
     supporting investigations and prosecutions abroad. In Fiscal 
     Year 2023, efforts by the Mexico TCIU resulted in more than 
     59 criminal arrests and the seizure of 64,138 pounds of 
     precursor chemicals.
       To better detect smuggling, we are dramatically expanding 
     the use of NII technology at ports of entry, through which 
     more than 90 percent of fentanyl is smuggled into the United 
     States. We are adding new state-of-the-art NII systems to 
     complement those currently in use across Southwest Border 
     ports of entry, with 72 construction projects underway at 15 
     ports.
       Our strategy has evolved to target not just fentanyl, but 
     also the tools and materials the transnational criminal 
     organizations use to make it. We are interdicting and seizing 
     precursor chemicals, pill press machines, die molds, and pill 
     press parts used in the manufacturing process. We are 
     targeting Chinese pill press and precursor supply chains, 
     Mexican pill press brokers, the Mexican transnational 
     criminal organizations and the domestic traffickers who are 
     producing and moving fentanyl, and the money launderers who 
     help facilitate this illicit trade. Our efforts over the past 
     year have resulted in the seizure of nearly 1 million pounds 
     of fentanyl and methamphetamine precursor chemicals.
       Our Department is helping partners in the Western 
     Hemisphere and Asia build their own capacity to combat the 
     smuggling of illicit fentanyl. We recently established a 
     working group for ongoing communication and law enforcement 
     coordination with the People's Republic of China to increase 
     cooperation and information sharing.
       We are innovating with the responsible use of artificial 
     intelligence at our ports of entry. This year alone, machine 
     learning models that help CBP Officers determine which 
     suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary 
     screening have led to 240 seizures, which included thousands 
     of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl. 
     More details about our efforts to combat fentanyl can be 
     found in this recent DHS fact sheet.
       There is much more to do in the fight against fentanyl and 
     other synthetic opioids. We must reduce both supply and 
     demand. To accomplish this, we must work together to tackle 
     what we all agree is a horrific problem that poses grave 
     danger to our citizens, our communities, and our nation.
       The Chairman and Members of the Committee's majority have 
     harshly criticized the Department's responsiveness to 
     oversight. The allegations are baseless and inaccurate.
       I take very seriously my responsibility to cooperate in 
     good faith with Congress's oversight function. I have devoted 
     significant Departmental resources and personal time to this 
     effort. I have testified publicly in 27 Congressional 
     hearings since I became DHS Secretary. Twelve of those 
     hearings were in the House of Representatives, including 
     seven before the House Homeland Security Committee. I have 
     testified more than any other member of the Cabinet.
       In every House hearing, I was asked and I answered many 
     questions about immigration and the border. In all but one of 
     those hearings, I was asked and I answered questions about 
     our counter-fentanyl work. The Department has produced 
     thousands of pages of documents, provided countless 
     briefings, and sent dozens of witnesses to appear in hearings 
     and transcribed interviews. We have produced more than 13,000 
     pages of documents and data in response to this Committee's 
     requests alone. Further information evidencing the 
     Department's response to Congressional oversight is attached.
       Whatever proceedings you initiate, however baseless, my 
     responsiveness to oversight requests will not waiver. The 
     Department has been committed to responding and will continue 
     to respond in good faith to Congressional oversight requests.
       I will defer a discussion of the Constitutionality of your 
     current effort to the many respected scholars and experts 
     across the political spectrum who already have opined that it 
     is contrary to law. What I will not defer to others is a 
     response to the politically motivated accusations and 
     personal attacks you have made against me.
       I have been privileged to serve our country for most of my 
     professional life. I have adhered scrupulously and fervently 
     to the Oath of Office I have taken six times in my public 
     service career.
       My reverence for law enforcement was instilled in me by my 
     parents, who brought me to this country to escape the 
     Communist takeover of Cuba and allow me the freedoms and 
     opportunity that our democracy provides. My parents 
     experienced such loss at the fisted hands of authoritarianism 
     that the American law enforcement officer stood as a tangible 
     symbol of safety and the rule of law in our new home. When I 
     was a boy, my mother would have me jump out of the back seat 
     of our family's station wagon, approach a police officer in 
     uniform, extend my hand, and say thank you.
       It was because of everything America meant and gave to my 
     family that I was motivated to enter public service. It was 
     because of my admiration and respect for the men and women 
     who wore a badge that I wanted to work with them to enforce 
     our country's laws. In 1989, I was privileged to take the 
     Oath of Office and be sworn-in as an Assistant United States 
     Attorney for the Central District of California.
       For the next nearly nine years, I worked with federal, 
     state, and local law enforcement agents and officers in the 
     investigation and prosecution of federal crimes. We seized

[[Page H474]]

     and forfeited property purchased with proceeds of drug deals, 
     and successfully prosecuted bank robbers; counterfeiters; 
     members of the MS-13, 18th Street, Crips, Bloods, and other 
     street gangs; cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana 
     traffickers; migrant smugglers; illegal border crossers (most 
     often criminals with multiple felonies, deportations, and 
     reentries); fraudulent document manufacturers; illegal 
     telemarketers; and many others. In 1996 I became the Chief of 
     our General Crimes Section, where I trained all new Assistant 
     United States Attorneys in the investigation and prosecution 
     of federal criminal cases and how to try them before a jury. 
     I have represented the United States in a federal courtroom 
     in hundreds of hard-fought criminal cases.
       In 1998 I was confirmed to serve as the United States 
     Attorney for the Central District of California. I was the 
     first federal prosecutor in our office's history to be 
     promoted from within to the top leadership position. To have 
     my father at my side as I took the Oath to assume that role 
     was one of the proudest moments of my life.
       Over the next three years, I prosecuted cases of national 
     and international significance, enforcing a wide breadth of 
     criminal statutes. I pursued the death penalty against 
     members of the Mexican mafia, brought RICO charges against a 
     Los Angeles street gang, and successfully prosecuted federal 
     cases of money laundering, public corruption, human 
     trafficking, foreign corrupt practices, drug trafficking, 
     securities fraud, violent crime, immigration fraud, organized 
     crime, and much more. A partial list of the recognition I 
     received for my work as an Assistant United States Attorney 
     and as the United States Attorney is attached.
       I returned to public service in August 2009, upon my 
     confirmation as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and 
     Immigration Services. I vividly remember taking the Oath and 
     getting to work on a top-to-bottom review of the agency and 
     leading a subsequent realignment to best serve its mission. 
     As a result of that review, I created a new Directorate 
     within the agency--the Fraud Detection and National Security 
     Directorate--to prioritize and more effectively fulfill the 
     fundamental responsibilities of safeguarding our homeland and 
     protecting the integrity of our legal immigration system.
       I served as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and 
     Immigration Services for four years, until I was nominated 
     and confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as the 
     Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. My responsibilities as 
     the Deputy Secretary covered the entire expanse of the 
     Department's work, from going after the drug cartels, 
     building the Department's cybersecurity capabilities, 
     combating illegal immigration, and strengthening the 
     Department's partnerships with state and local law 
     enforcement, to negotiating security agreements with foreign 
     countries, implementing new trade and travel protocols, and 
     advancing our interests in the Arctic.
       For my service as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, I was awarded the Distinguished Service Award, the 
     Department's highest civilian honor; the Distinguished Public 
     Service Award, the United States Coast Guard's highest 
     civilian honor; and recognition and awards from law 
     enforcement agencies across the Department and the federal 
     government.
       On February 2, 2021, 1 took the Oath for the sixth time in 
     my public service career and was sworn-in as the Secretary of 
     Homeland Security. I am now in my 22nd year of service to our 
     country. I no longer introduce and argue evidence in a 
     federal courtroom to persuade the jury to convict a dangerous 
     criminal, but the mission to which I remain devoted is the 
     same: to safeguard the American people.
       I assure you that your false accusations do not rattle me 
     and do not divert me from the law enforcement and broader 
     public service mission to which I have devoted most of my 
     career and to which I remain devoted. The privilege of 
     working alongside the 260,000 men and women who serve in the 
     Department of Homeland Security--the privilege of working 
     with incredibly talented and dedicated people on behalf of 
     the United States of America--is the greatest thing one can 
     do.
           Secretary,
                                            Alejandro N. Mayorkas,
                                                        Secretary.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, former Department of 
Homeland Security officials recognize that this impeachment is baseless 
and has the potential to distract from the ``actual business of 
legislating.'' A divisive impeachment is far from a constructive 
solution. I include in the Record a letter by former senior homeland 
security officials who are opposed to this political stunt.
                                                 January 17, 2024.
     Representative Mark E. Green, MD,
     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Representative Bennie G. Thompson,
     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.

   Opposition to the Impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas Sign-On Letter

       As former senior homeland security officials who served in 
     administrations of both parties, we are compelled to express 
     our deep concern regarding the potential impeachment of 
     Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
       Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas over long-standing political 
     differences on immigration and border policies would be a 
     grave mistake with far-reaching consequences for our national 
     security and economic prosperity. The U.S. southern border is 
     undeniably facing challenges, but assigning blame solely 
     based on political and partisan grounds will do little to 
     address the complex issues at hand.
       It is imperative to consider the historical context; 
     Congress has not impeached a Cabinet Secretary in over a 
     century. Impeachment is a tool to remove officers of the 
     government for treason, bribery, and high crimes and 
     misdemeanors. The Founders never intended it to be used as a 
     tool for mitigating policy disagreements.
       Initiating such proceedings not only threatens to undermine 
     national security but sets a perilous precedent that could 
     have dire implications for the stability of our government. 
     Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would only serve to distract 
     from the pressing need to implement effective policy 
     solutions to rectify our immigration system and fortify 
     America's national security.
       The bipartisan struggle to assert control over the southern 
     border has persisted for more than two decades, transcending 
     administrations of both Democratic and Republican 
     orientations. Resorting to a partisan impeachment would be 
     counterproductive, exacerbating the existing polarization 
     around this critical issue without addressing its root 
     causes.
       Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 
     grappled with challenges in attracting and confirming senior 
     officials, a situation detrimental to its overall 
     functionality. Impeaching a Senate-confirmed Secretary would 
     only contribute to the chaotic leadership structure, 
     hindering the crucial mission of DHS in ensuring the security 
     and economic success of our nation.
       The significance of DHS's mission cannot be overstated, 
     ranging from processing legal travelers at air and seaports 
     to confronting drug-related threats at the border to securing 
     aviation and other critical infrastructure to cybersecurity 
     and many other missions. The performance of DHS directly 
     impacts the lives of everyday Americans, and it is incumbent 
     upon us to navigate the current challenges with a focus on 
     constructive solutions rather than divisive measures.
       We urge both Republicans and Democrats to set aside 
     political differences and collaborate to develop genuine and 
     meaningful changes to address the situation at the border. 
     Ongoing negotiations around border security and funding 
     present a potential opportunity for constructive development. 
     We advocate for legislative solutions, including adequate 
     funding, to replace the outdated policies that currently 
     characterize our immigration system. It is crucial that 
     Congress prioritizes solutions that strengthen our borders, 
     treat migrants with dignity, and reduce backlogs that delay 
     decisions on asylum claims, legal immigration petitions, and 
     other cases and applications.
       To be clear, the signatories to this letter do not all 
     agree with the wisdom or effectiveness of all the immigration 
     and border policies Secretary Mayorkas oversees, just as we 
     often disagreed with policies his predecessors implemented. 
     However, escalating these policy disagreements into an 
     impeachment proceeding is a dangerous distraction from the 
     actual business of legislating, where Congress' focus should 
     lie.
       We urge the House of Representatives not to initiate or 
     conclude impeachment proceedings against Secretary Mayorkas. 
     If the House completes such an impeachment, we urge the 
     Senate to reject the proposal.
           Thank you,
       Jayson Ahern, Former Commissioner (A), U.S. Customs and

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, former Secretary of 
Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, who was appointed by Republican 
President George W. Bush, wrote an op-ed for the conservative Wall 
Street Journal opposed to the baseless impeachment of Secretary 
Mayorkas. Former Secretary Chertoff wrote that House Republicans have, 
quote ``failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar'' for an 
impeachable offense. I include in the Record the Chertoff op-ed.

             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 28, 2024]

                    Don't Impeach Alejandro Mayorkas

                         (By Michael Chertoff)

       Political and policy disagreements aren't impeachable 
     offenses. The Constitution gives Congress the power to 
     impeach federal officials for treason, bribery and ``other 
     high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That's a high bar. In the 
     history of our republic, only one cabinet secretary has been 
     impeached (for receiving corrupt kickback payments).
       The House Homeland Security Committee is moving toward a 
     Jan. 30 vote on articles of impeachment against Homeland 
     Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, with a possible vote 
     by the full House on Feb. 5. As homeland security secretary 
     under President George W. Bush--and as a former federal 
     judge, U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general--I can 
     say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the 
     House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have 
     failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.
       This is why Republicans aren't seeking to hold Mr. Mayorkas 
     to the Constitution's ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' 
     standard for impeachment. They make the unsupported argument 
     that he is derelict in his duty.
       Since Mr. Mayorkas took office, the majority of migrants 
     encountered at the Southwest border have been removed, 
     returned or expelled. In fact, since the pandemic-era Title 
     42 policy was ended last May, DHS removed, returned or 
     expelled more noncitizens than in any five-month period in 
     the past 10 years. The truth is that our national immigration 
     system is outdated, and DHS leaders under both parties have 
     done their best to manage our immigration system without 
     adequate congressional support.
       I don't agree with every policy decision the Biden 
     administration has made. There are aspects of immigration 
     strategy that are worthy of debate. But House Republicans are 
     ducking difficult policy work and hard-fought compromise. 
     Impeachment is a diversion from fixing our broken immigration 
     laws and giving DHS the resources needed to secure the 
     border.
       Our nation is at its best when our leaders work together to 
     confront the seemingly intractable. The situation at our 
     border and our national security, demand such bipartisan 
     collaboration.
       Despite our different parties, I know Mr. Mayorkas to be 
     fair and honest--dedicated to the safety and security of the 
     U.S. He has represented DHS to the country and to both 
     parties in Congress with integrity. Republicans in the House 
     should drop this impeachment charade and work with Mr. 
     Mayorkas to deliver for the American people.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it comes as no surprise 
that the Biden administration is opposed to this sham impeachment. The 
Biden administration has done everything in its power to uphold the law 
and have an orderly, humane approach to border security. I include in 
the Record a Statement of Administration Policy opposing the baseless 
impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.

                   Statement of Administration Policy


   H. Res. 863--Resolution Impeaching Secretary of Homeland Security 
                 Alejandro Mayorkas--Rep. Greene, R-GA

       The Administration strongly opposes H. Res. 863, a House 
     resolution introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to 
     impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.
       Secretary Mayorkas, a Cuban immigrant who came to the 
     United States with his family as political refugees, has 
     spent more than two decades serving his country with honor 
     and integrity in a decorated career in law enforcement and 
     public service. From his time in the Justice Department as a 
     U.S. Attorney to his service as Deputy Secretary and now 
     Secretary of Homeland Security, he has upheld the rule of law 
     faithfully and has demonstrated a deep commitment to the 
     values that make our Nation great. Impeaching Secretary 
     Mayorkas would be an unprecedented and unconstitutional act 
     of political retribution that would do nothing to solve the 
     challenges our Nation faces in securing the border.
       This impeachment effort clearly fails to meet the 
     Constitution's threshold for impeachable offenses. The 
     Constitution permits impeachment only for ``Treason, Bribery, 
     or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The impeachment 
     power was never intended as a device for members of an 
     opposing political party to harass Executive Branch officials 
     over policy disputes. Legal scholars across the ideological 
     spectrum, including every scholar who testified to Congress 
     about the Resolution and conservatives who have previously 
     sided with Congressional Republicans on matters of 
     impeachment, agree that impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would 
     be an ``abuse of the Constitution'' and that there is no 
     ``cognizable basis'' for it.''
       The Resolution's purported grounds for impeachment have no 
     basis in law or fact. The Resolution does not demonstrate a 
     failure to follow the law in any respect, let alone a 
     ``willful'' one. Nor does it demonstrate that Secretary 
     Mayorkas has ``breached the public trust.'' To the contrary, 
     the Secretary has scrupulously followed the law, faithfully 
     implemented policies to address the significant and 
     longstanding challenges at the border, and engaged with 
     Congress and the public in a manner that is truthful and 
     transparent.
       Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would trivialize this solemn 
     constitutional power and invite more partisan abuse of this 
     authority in the future. It would do nothing to solve the 
     challenges we face in securing our Nation's borders, nor 
     would it provide the funding the President has repeatedly 
     requested for more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, 
     and cutting-edge tools to detect and stop fentanyl at the 
     border.
       If the House of Representatives wishes to address these 
     challenges, the Constitution provides an obvious means: 
     passing legislation. The Administration will continue to 
     engage with Congress to enact bipartisan solutions for 
     securing our border and strengthening our immigration system 
     and strongly urges the House of Representatives to join us, 
     instead of supporting this baseless impeachment.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  As you have heard, the evidence against Secretary Mayorkas is 
compelling, but so too is the constitutional justification for 
impeachment. The constitutional history and the Framers' intent are 
clear. We, the people's Representatives, have no option but to exercise 
this duty when executive branch officials blatantly refuse to comply 
with the laws we have passed, threaten the separation of powers, 
imperil the constitutional order, and expose Americans to untold 
suffering and death.
  This historical record is unambiguous. From Madison to Hamilton, the 
Framers uniformly believed that executive branch officials who fail to 
defend the Constitution and enforce the law should no longer hold 
office.
  We know that Secretary Mayorkas has refused to comply with the law. 
We know that he lied to Congress and breached the public trust. We all 
witnessed the horrific consequences.
  In closing, my question to my colleagues is this: If Secretary 
Mayorkas' brazen, blatant disregard for the laws we have passed is not 
enough to warrant action, why are we even here? What is the point of 
passing laws if we allow the executive branch to violate those laws 
with impunity?
  Do we care so little for our constitutional role and responsibilities 
that we would allow an official of either party to openly defy laws 
passed by this House, the people's House? I truly hope not. That would 
be a dangerous precedent and a serious abdication of our duty.
  Willfully violating the law to open America's borders to millions of 
unvetted migrants and breaching the public trust are grave offenses 
against our country, our Constitution, and our constituents. It is, 
therefore, incumbent upon us, on this solemn day, to fulfill our oaths 
to the Constitution and exercise the power to impeach.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 863, 
Republicans' sham effort to impeach Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
  House Republicans are choosing to pursue an impeachment that has no 
basis in wrongdoing by Secretary Mayorkas. Their cynical ploy has 
everything to do with weaponizing a constitutional process in an 
attempt to divert attention from their inability to provide viable 
solutions to the border crisis. Secretary Mayorkas has not violated the 
law, let alone committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''

[[Page H476]]

which is the constitutional standard for impeachment.
  Rather than working toward bipartisan solutions, House Republicans 
are doing the bidding of former President Donald Trump in a pointless 
attempt to reinstate the Trump administration's failed and inhumane 
border policies. They know these policies will not become law. They are 
actively blocking real solutions for the complex issues that impact 
border communities and migrants.
  House Republicans should stop wasting time and taxpayer resources by 
pushing lies and to score cheap political points with their MAGA base 
and instead work together with Democrats to solve problems for the 
American people.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the previous question is ordered on 
the resolution, as amended.
  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H. Res. 
863 is postponed.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Calvert) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DeLauro) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.


                             General Leave

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer H. Res. 7217, the Israel Security 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024. This bill provides $17.6 
billion in emergency supplemental appropriations, which will provide 
needed military assistance to America's great ally, Israel, and support 
U.S. military forces operating in the region.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas carried out a brutal, unprovoked terrorist 
attack on the people of Israel. The horrific acts committed on this day 
resulted in 1,200 deaths, thousands injured, and 240 hostages, 136 of 
whom remain in captivity, and over 30 are believed to be dead.
  The Israeli people are still reeling from the horrors of October 7, 
but they have bravely pushed their sorrow aside to root out and fight 
Hamas and ensure that their people are never threatened again.
  Last November, the House passed a $14.3 billion supplemental to shore 
up our ally. The bill included:
  $5.2 billion in missile defense systems such as Iron Dome, David's 
Sling, and Iron Beam;
  $4.4 billion to backfill U.S. stocks;
  $1 billion for U.S. munitions production, such as 155 rounds and 
small diameter bombs;
  $3.5 billion for foreign military financing of U.S. systems and 
munitions; and
  $200 million for the protection of U.S. personnel and emergency 
evacuations of American citizens in the region as a result of this 
conflict.
  These requirements remain unchanged and are aligned with the Biden 
administration's supplemental request. They are included, again, in the 
bill we are considering today.
  Unfortunately, the situation in the Middle East has continued to 
deteriorate since November. The Houthis have launched dozens of 
missile, drone, and boat attacks on military and civil ships in the Red 
Sea.
  On January 28, three U.S. soldiers were killed and 40 were injured by 
a drone attack at a military base in Jordan caused by an Iranian-backed 
militia. Just this morning, the Houthis fired missiles at two civilian 
ships in Yemen, one British and one American. We are putting our 
military in an untenable situation, and attacks continue to escalate.
  Now, we must act to shore up our ally, Israel, and provide our 
military with the resources they need to protect our troops in the 
region.
  The new funding in this bill addresses that changing reality by 
providing $3.3 billion for U.S. military operations in the region 
funded through December 2024. This includes $1 billion for low-cost 
defensive capabilities to thwart future attacks on U.S. forces in the 
region.
  In many instances, we have been intercepting low-cost Iranian-backed 
drones with multimillion-dollar missiles. This funding will protect our 
forces and put us on the right side of the cost curve.
  This funding bill resupplies Israel's defensive capabilities, 
restores America's defense industry to replenish our stocks, funds 
necessary operations for our forces in the region, and sends a strong 
signal that the United States will not back down.
  I am grateful for the support of Chairwoman Granger, Chairman Diaz-
Balart, Republican leadership, and the dozens of Members who have 
cosponsored this bill. I am also grateful for the support expressed by 
many of my friends across the aisle. We have an opportunity today to 
come together and send a strong message that the United States stands 
with Israel.
  I want to address the position of the Democratic leadership, 
including President Biden's veto threat. Assertions that this bill 
plays politics are patently false. Last November, Democrats said they 
wanted a clean bill. That is exactly what this is. This bill simply 
provides necessary resources to our closest ally in the region and our 
own military. I introduced this bill because it is the right thing to 
do. The only people making it political are those who oppose it.
  Tomorrow is the 4-month anniversary of the horrific October 7 
terrorist attack, which is an act of war. Israel knows that we stand 
with them, and today we can send a clear message that we support their 
efforts to eradicate Hamas, the only way to truly bring peace to the 
region.
  Likewise, our American military men and women should know their 
government stands fully behind them as they respond to these numerous 
attacks. Terrorists and those supporting them should have no question 
of American resolve.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support the Israel Security 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, 122 days ago, Hamas terrorists murdered over 1,000 
Israelis and at least 30 Americans in cold blood. They took hundreds 
hostage in the worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust.
  President Biden's supplemental funding request for Israel, Ukraine, 
the Indo-Pacific, and for our border has gone all but completely 
unanswered by this historic do-nothing majority. For months our 
colleagues in the majority insisted that any foreign assistance bill 
must include border policy changes. So spoke Speaker Johnson at the 
White House several months ago, and he said that we needed a bipartisan 
border security agreement that would open and unlock the door for funds 
for foreign assistance.

  Yet, Republicans have rejected a bipartisan bill that would 
accomplish exactly what they have asked for.
  While declaring that bill dead on arrival in the House, the majority 
has opted to consider a bill that we know the President will veto. This 
is a political stunt that makes it less likely that Israel gets its 
funds while endangering U.S. national security. This accomplishes 
nothing and delays aid getting out to our allies and providing 
humanitarian relief.
  Our allies cannot wait, our border communities cannot wait, and our 
cities cannot wait.
  I wholeheartedly support funding for Israel. I have written aid to 
Israel supplemental appropriations over the last several years. 
However, I cannot support this bill which falls dangerously short of 
what this moment calls for. Our allies are facing existential threats, 
and our friends and foes around the globe are watching and waiting to 
see how America will respond.

[[Page H479]]

  Putin is watching, Xi is watching, and the Ayatollah Khamenei is 
watching. Russia, China, and Iran are watching, and our allies are 
watching.
  This bill does not provide a penny in humanitarian assistance. We 
cannot abandon the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of these 
conflicts, particularly in Gaza. The costs of Hamas' rule over Gaza and 
the war against Israel are borne by innocent Palestinians. Israel's 
harsh response has raised these costs further. Families and children 
are facing unthinkable circumstances. Millions are facing starvation 
because of this conflict. No one with clear eyes would say otherwise.
  Furthermore, if this bill were to become law, there is no path to 
support Ukraine. We are witnessing the first land war in Europe in a 
generation, and through inaction, this Congress is handing a sovereign 
nation over to a ruthless autocrat jeopardizing U.S. national security. 
Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine. If he overtakes Ukraine and moves against 
a NATO ally, then we will see U.S. troops in a ground war.
  If we do not provide Ukraine with what they need, then the ultimate 
legacy of the 118th Congress will be the appeasement of a dictator and 
the destruction of a free nation.
  Our allies and our enemies in Europe and around the globe will know 
that the United States is no longer a trusted partner in the security 
of the free world. Yet, we know that a supermajority of this body 
supports Ukraine.
  There are unquestionably more than 218 votes in the House for a 
supplemental appropriations bill that includes Israel, humanitarian 
assistance, Ukraine, and Indo-Pacific assistance. Yet, House 
Republicans are refusing to take that path. The Senate bill acts now to 
address the border that is in crisis. The status quo is unacceptable, 
but Republicans say no to moving forward.
  We should reject this unserious effort, this political ploy, and 
insist on a bipartisan product that supports our allies and protects 
the integrity of our border.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan effort. This is a 
bipartisan bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Granger), who is the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, a 
bill that will provide additional support for Israel, and I want to 
thank Chairman Calvert for the leadership on this bill that he has 
given.
  Nearly 4 months ago, we watched Hamas brutally attack the Israeli 
people. Unfortunately, the situation in the region has only gotten 
worse. Israel, and now U.S. forces, have been attacked by terrorist 
groups backed by Iran. Funding is needed to address the growing threats 
we face.
  The bill before us provides a total of $17.6 billion in emergency 
resources. Specifically, the bill includes funding for Iron Dome, 
David's Sling, Iron Beam defense systems, and other weapons through the 
foreign military financing program.
  To ensure that U.S. support does not impact our own military 
readiness, the bill restocks the items we have already sent to Israel. 
It is also providing $3.3 billion to support our military operations in 
the region.
  Now more than ever, we must stand firm with Israel. The bill sends a 
strong message that the United States supports our great ally.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the 
important bill.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member of the Defense 
Subcommittee.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DeLauro for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces two immense national security 
challenges, and Congress must address them both: Russia's illegal and 
unjust invasion of Ukraine, which threatens their territorial integrity 
and the security of Europe; and Israel's response to the Hamas 
terrorist attacks on October 7, which has spiraled into a regional 
conflict between the United States and Iranian proxies.
  Tragically, three U.S. servicemembers have lost their lives in this 
conflict.
  Our Nation and the world need decisive action from Congress. The 
Hamas attacks of October 7 were barbaric, and Israel does have the 
right to defend itself.
  I have long supported missile defense priorities like Iron Dome in 
the Defense Appropriations bill, but this is not the way to get more 
aid to Israel.
  The Senate and the White House do not support this action. This bill 
was introduced to get ahead of the Senate's bipartisan security 
supplemental which does address all of our national security 
priorities. The Republican House bill plays politics with our national 
security, and that is wrong. It is a nonstarter for those of us who 
seriously want to address these crises in a comprehensive manner.
  Here is how we do that: We do provide the assistance to Israel, but 
it is equally as important to get more lifesaving humanitarian aid into 
Gaza because if we don't, then the situation for civilians will 
continue to deteriorate; starvation will grow, disease will spread, and 
Palestinian civilians, most of them children, will continue to suffer, 
and many will die.

                              {time}  1715

  Because of this, Israel's security situation will worsen if we don't 
do the humanitarian aid.
  We need to support our national priorities around the world. Our 
servicemembers are working nonstop to defend commercial shipping routes 
and deter broader regional conflicts with Iran. They deserve our 
support.
  We must provide additional security assistance to Ukraine. The 
situation there is desperate, Mr. Speaker. Ukrainian civilians will 
continue to be murdered, and their military faces a serious shortage of 
ammunition. We must remedy that.
  Congress cannot afford to ignore any of these challenges because 
America cannot afford to ignore them.
  We must lead. The Republican majority, in my opinion, is failing to 
do just that. If we fail here, the national security consequences we 
will face abroad are that we will leave both Israel and U.S. troops in 
the Middle East in a more dangerous position when it comes to Iranian 
activities; we will condemn more Palestinian civilians in Gaza to die; 
and we will doom the Ukrainian people to face a dark future with their 
democratic aspirations crushed by Putin's boot.
  We will leave our European allies, who have just approved a 50-
billion-euro package for Ukraine, to face a resurgent Russian military 
on their borders.
  The majority has left us no choice but to vote ``no.''
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is regarding 
Israel. We have time to debate Ukraine at a later date, but today, this 
is regarding aid to Israel, which we need to do immediately.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
Womack), a member of the Appropriations Committee's Defense 
Subcommittee and chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Financial 
Services and General Government Subcommittee.
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman Calvert, for 
giving me an opportunity to speak on this very vital piece of 
legislation.
  It is our solemn duty, Mr. Speaker, to protect our allies and defeat 
our common enemies. I think we have agreement on both sides of the 
aisle that we need to do that.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a brutal attack on our friends in 
Israel. We have all seen the carnage, the assessment of damage, and the 
terrific loss of life in Israel.
  This unwarranted and unprovoked attack was a cruel display of the 
worst of humanity. We should all agree to that.
  Israel is a stabilizing force in the Middle East. It has to be 
supported at all costs.
  From my time as a commander of forces in the Sinai Peninsula, where I 
had a close working relationship with the IDF, to my time as a Member 
of Congress on this important subcommittee, I have always been a strong 
supporter of Israel and will continue to advocate on its behalf.
  This $17.6 billion appropriated will save Israeli lives, and it will 
work to

[[Page H480]]

defeat Hamas terrorists. The funding will replenish and procure 
advanced weapon systems, defense articles, and defense services. It 
will provide for the procurement of the Iron Dome, David's Sling, and 
Iron Beam defense systems to combat short-range rockets and support 
U.S. military operations in Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, in short, we need to pass this bill. I encourage all of 
my colleagues to take a serious look at it. Pass the bill. Let's get it 
to the Senate and get it to the White House.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support Israel's 
absolute right to exist, to defend itself, and to bring home its 
citizens--and ours--who are still held captive after 122 days.
  Over those 122 days, President Biden has firmly backed Israel's 
response to genocidal Hamas terror. He helped free over 100 hostages 
and continues working tirelessly to bring them all home. He has 
forcefully countered malign forces who attack our troops and oppose any 
future peace.
  Meanwhile, for 122 days, Republicans have ignored President Biden's 
urgent request: Safeguard our democracy and our allies from adversaries 
who seek chaos, death, and destruction.
  This abdication of responsibility fails our constituents, our allies, 
and our national security interests.
  After months of waiting, I won't hesitate to vote for Israel's 
defense in this moment of crisis.
  I am enraged that Republicans are playing political games, caving to 
Trump and the extreme fringe of their party at the expense of our most 
sacred national obligations. They cynically pound the table about Iran, 
but they are suddenly blind to Putin's wrath in Ukraine and deaf to 
Xi's threats against Taiwan. They callously disregard the humanitarian 
tragedy facing Gazans, who are also victims of Hamas, eroding our 
credibility and undermining future prospects for a just and lasting 
peace.
  I am appalled that after 3,300 anti-Semitic attacks in this country 
in just 3 months, they will pass a dozen nonbinding resolutions only to 
turn around and defund basic protections for Jewish Americans.
  We could have passed the President's emergency request months ago in 
a massive bipartisan show of strength. Instead, Republicans are 
needlessly weaponizing these vital efforts to score cheap political 
points.
  It took far too long to get here. Yet, this bill still falls short of 
our needs.
  As a Jew and proud Zionist, my conscience demands that I vote with 
Israel in her hour of need in this moment of crisis. I won't pretend 
this bill comes close to meeting our security needs.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 7217, the 
Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.
  In the face of terror and absolute unprovoked aggression, Israel is 
in the fight for its existence. The United States must not shirk its 
duty and must support Israel. Israel has the absolute right to exist.
  Mr. Speaker, the world is essentially on fire. If you do not combat 
dictators, if you do not combat terrorists, we are shirking our duty.
  Today, with the United States being Israel's greatest ally, we must 
support them. We already sent the Senate a support bill. We sent them a 
support bill for Israel. We did that barely a month after the Hamas 
attack on October 7.
  What have Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats done? They have sat on 
it. Now, they want to send us a bill to try to fix their crisis at the 
border in the guise of support for Israel.
  By the way, their crisis at the border, President Biden's crisis at 
the border, has cost this Nation $450 billion. That pales in comparison 
to the $17 billion that we are asking for Israel.
  We don't need gimmicks. We don't need a bill, which hasn't even been 
passed by the Senate, that will allow more and more illegals to come 
into this country. What we need is a singular bill to support Israel, 
our greatest ally.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7217.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill for emergency funding for Israel and for U.S. military operations 
in the Middle East.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists brutally attacked Israel, 
murdering, maiming, and raping innocent women, men, and children, and 
taking 240 hostages, many who remain in dark tunnels being starved and 
abused.
  Adding fuel to the fire, Iran proxies are shooting rockets into 
Israel, jeopardizing commerce in the Red Sea and killing American 
soldiers on military bases.
  Funds from this bill will enable Israel to defend itself and the U.S. 
to protect our own military personnel.
  Mr. Speaker, I recognize and respect the concern of friends who 
support Israel but want other also important issues to be addressed.
  Mr. Speaker, the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.
  Let me be clear: My vote will be for what is in this proposed bill 
and not a rebuke of what is left out.
  I fear that a divided Congress will embolden Israel's adversaries and 
put our own military in harm's way. Israel's security is our security.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand with Israel. I stand with humanity. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Lawler).
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to show my strong support for 
this aid package that will support our closest ally, Israel.
  Providing much-needed assistance for Israel and for U.S. forces in 
the Middle East region reaffirms our unwavering commitment to 
democracy, security, and peace in the Middle East.
  This is a funding package that will enhance Israel's defense 
capabilities, specifically in the area of missile and rocket defense, 
with significant allocations for the Iron Dome and David's Sling 
systems and the innovative Iron Beam system designed to counteract 
shorter-range threats.
  All of these are made even more necessary due to Iran's investment in 
weapons for terrorists around the region, including Hamas, the Houthis, 
Hezbollah, and others. These groups are expanding their attacks on U.S. 
troops.
  This aid package should transcend partisan lines. It is about more 
than supporting Israel's right to defend itself. It is about securing 
our strategic interests and showing support for our closest ally, 
Israel.
  That is why I was shocked to see that President Biden swore to veto 
this legislation, which provides our ally, Israel, with essential aid.
  There are no policy riders or poison pills. It is a clean bill 
supporting the State of Israel. This should not be political, and it 
shouldn't be that complicated. Yet, for whatever reason, Joe Biden has 
indicated he would veto this bill, and House and Senate Democrats are 
falling all over themselves to oppose it.
  It has been 122 days since the terrorist attack of October 7. The 
House passed an aid package months ago. The Senate did not act. 
According to reports, the Senate may not even have the votes tomorrow 
to pass their supplemental bill. Therefore, this may end up being the 
only bill in town.

  Mr. Speaker, I just can't understand my Democratic colleagues. 
Whether you think it is political or not, vote ``yes.'' What, are you 
crazy? I just don't even understand the logic. It is a clean bill. Vote 
``yes.''
  Ultimately, even if the Senate does pass their bill and it does come 
here, then we will deal with that. Why would you ever want to be on the 
record, on a clean bill, opposing aid to the State of Israel? It is 
foolish.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues will 
find the moral courage to support this funding package and support 
Israel at her time of need while providing critical resources to our 
troops overseas. A little common sense here--vote ``yes.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.

[[Page H481]]

  

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. Himes), the ranking member of the Intelligence 
Committee.
  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, maybe I can help my confused friend from New 
York so that he might understand what is at stake here and why 
Democrats are going to vote ``no.''
  I stand here with some trepidation because, for a decade and a half, 
I have stood here and proudly voted to support Israel, and Israel has 
been attacked. I know that we will pass Israel aid.
  Make no mistake, what we are seeing today is a profoundly cynical 
political maneuver. For my friend from New York, let me explain it.
  Mr. Calvert, Ms. DeLauro, and I were in the White House when the 
Speaker--all of 2 days as Speaker of the House--looked at the National 
Security Advisor and said that we will do border first, Ukraine, 
Taiwan, and Israel. He demanded that. The White House said, no, we 
shouldn't bind those things up because that creates the possibility 
that we don't get any of that done.
  Then, we made very real progress. We have a bipartisan package that 
does all of those things. It counters Putin's murderousness in Ukraine, 
supports Taiwan, stands with Israel, and provides humanitarian aid. It 
offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do a border and 
immigration deal, an immigration deal that the Border Patrol union has 
endorsed.

                              {time}  1730

  My Republican colleagues trot out the Border Patrol every day and 
say, look at these poor guys.
  The Border Patrol union has endorsed this bill. This should pass. It 
is a historic opportunity to stand up for what we believe as Americans, 
but then something happened. Donald Trump called.
  Donald Trump called the Speaker, and the Speaker said it. He said, we 
know how he feels about Ukraine. He said, don't do the border deal, a 
border deal negotiated with one of the most conservative Senators in 
the United States Senate.
  Mr. Calvert, Ms. DeLauro, and I heard Mitch McConnell say: This is a 
better deal than we get if Donald Trump is President and we have the 
House and the Senate, but Donald Trump called.
  I need to put another name out there: Neville Chamberlain, 1938, 
``peace for our time'' because he kowtowed to a dictator. That is what 
is at stake.
  We will hang the legacy of Neville Chamberlain around our necks if we 
don't seize this historic opportunity to do a comprehensive security 
bill and reject this political cynical maneuver.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the House was excluded from all 
negotiations regarding the Senate supplemental, and today we are 
talking about assistance to Israel that is needed immediately.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill 
authored by my good friend from California,   Ken Calvert.
  This legislation provides additional security assistance to ensure 
Israel, our greatest Middle Eastern ally, survives the most significant 
threats to its existence to date.
  The Jewish people are confronting the unspeakable evil of Hamas, 
which perpetrated a callous, barbaric attack against the State of 
Israel, and continues to hold more than 132 people hostage in Gaza, 
including fellow Americans.
  Israel needs our support to ensure they can win this war and bring 
every hostage home, as well as counter the other threats to their 
national security. This bill reaffirms the United States' strong 
commitment to supporting the people of Israel by providing critical 
funding to reinforce the Israeli defense system and does so without 
compromising our own readiness.
  In addition, it ensures our ability to protect U.S. citizens and 
personnel in Israel. We cannot, and must not, turn our back on our 
ally. Doing so would only embolden Hamas, incentivize Iran to continue 
funding ruthless attacks on Israel, and weaken the security of American 
personnel in the region, not to mention the harm it would eventually 
bring to our own Nation here at home.
  We either ensure that Israel has the resources to win, or we will 
eventually be forced to fight the same enemies here. Those who want to 
annihilate Israel wish to do the same to America.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schneider).
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, Israel is fighting an existential war 
against Hamas, a death cult dedicated to the genocide of Jews and the 
annihilation of the Jewish state, while also being attacked by 
Hezbollah, the IRGC and Iranian proxies, and Houthis.
  There is no question that the United States must support our ally, 
Israel, but to my colleagues, I say it is folly to think that what is 
happening now in the Middle East is not connected to what is happening 
concurrently in Ukraine.
  If Ukraine falls, the aid we are providing Israel in this bill is 
only going to be a small downpayment to what will be needed when Israel 
faces a strengthened Hezbollah, backed by an emboldened Iran, 
encouraged by a newly-empowered Russia.
  And the United States will likely need to spend billions of 
additional dollars stationing more U.S. troops alongside our NATO 
allies in Europe.
  We are selling ourselves and our allies short by not taking the 
responsibility of leadership this country should be taking. If we don't 
continue, it is going to cost our kids and our kids' future.
  It is shameful that the Republicans and Speaker Johnson are using our 
most important ally, Israel, as a political cudgel. It threatens not 
only Israel's security, but America's security and our children's 
future.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden).
  Mr. VAN ORDEN. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that, in fact, I 
agree with him this one time. These events are connected, and the 
connection is the incredibly weak strategy the Biden administration has 
shown. That is why Putin invaded Ukraine and that is why Hamas has gone 
crazy in Israel.
  Immediately following the attacks of October 7, I went to Israel and 
I witnessed what Hamas did to the Jewish people, and as a retired Navy 
SEAL combat medic, it put me on my heels.
  I will remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that there 
was a cease-fire on October 6; that there was a de facto two-state 
solution on October 6, and that was broken by Hamas. Unlike the vast 
majority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I spent my 
entire adult life either training for, training others for, or at war 
myself.
  There is a difference between the conflict in Ukraine and what is 
taking place in Israel right now. Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, and 
he is after territorial gains. Hamas is a group of savages that are 
after the utter destruction of the Jews as a people. They want to 
eradicate them.
  There is a Member of the other party that has been censured on this 
floor for grossly anti-Semitic remarks, and that is what is taking 
place.
  Do not be fooled by this political rhetoric. I stand with the Jewish 
people now. I will stand with them from the beginning to the end, so 
the river to the sea never takes place.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Khanna).
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I will vote ``no'' today on the $17 billion 
aid package which provides a blank check to Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir, and 
the extreme rightwing government in Israel.
  How dare Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, have the gall 
to criticize America while calling for the mass expulsion of 
Palestinians?
  I will vote ``no'' because this bill includes zero humanitarian aid 
while children are dying and 400,000 Gazans face famine.
  I will vote ``no'' because this bill undermines human rights and 
international law, ignoring the recent ICJ decision calling on Israel 
to do more to protect Palestinian civilians.
  I will vote ``no'' because it is painfully obvious to the entire 
world that what is needed today is a permanent cease-fire and the 
release of all hostages.

[[Page H482]]

  There come moments in a Nation's history when our actions reveal our 
values. This is such a moment. We must stand for stopping the bombing, 
for ending this brutal war, and for justice in the Middle East with a 
Palestinian state with equal rights living side by side with Israel.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, more than 1,200 Israelis were killed 
on October 7 and 136 remain hostage. In response, 27,478 Palestinians 
have been killed, 70 percent of whom are women and children, and most 
Gazans today cannot reach a fully functioning hospital.
  This is not war; this is slaughter.
  And yet, after all this destruction and devastation, the Netanyahu 
government is still nowhere close to their stated objective of 
destroying Hamas.
  Moreover, the United States has our own requirements outlawing the 
transfer of weapons to forces engaged in gross human rights violations. 
We have a responsibility to honor those laws, to facilitate a bilateral 
cease-fire, to move to end this campaign of mass casualty and loss of 
life that risk bringing the entire region closer to a wider, deadlier 
conflict.
  This bill contains $17 billion on top of the billions we already 
transfer every year with no conditions and no humanitarian aid for the 
most vulnerable. Everyday Americans should not tolerate this 
squandering of our resources without oversight on such an inhumane and 
ineffective operation, especially when we are living paycheck to 
paycheck, and they cannot see their Congress address their most basic 
material concerns.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, here we go again, sending $17.6 billion of 
U.S. tax dollars with no conditions attached to Netanyahu's extremist 
government to drop more bombs on innocent Palestinians.
  The Israeli Government has already killed 27,000 people, 11,500 of 
whom were children.
  I am tired of my colleagues coming to me, whispering: I don't really 
like Netanyahu. Well, then, why are we sending him billions of dollars 
with no conditions?
  He literally is telling us over and over again what his intention is.
  I am tired of my colleagues coming to me and whispering to me: 
Rashida, I support a two-state solution. Great. Then send money that 
has conditions for a two-state solution because Netanyahu has over and 
over again told us he never wants to see a Palestinian state.
  I am tired. I oppose Netanyahu's war crimes and want him gone, too, 
but many of my colleagues that continue to tell me that do not want a 
condition to aid. They will just give it to a genocidal maniac.
  My message to my colleagues is simple: If you don't support 
Netanyahu, if you are disgusted by the countless videos of lifeless 
children pulled out of the rubble, if you actually believe in upholding 
human rights and international law, vote ``no'' on a blank check to 
Netanyahu's genocide.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the folks that believe in genocide is 
Hamas.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Diaz-Balart), the Chairman of the State and Foreign Operations 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from 
California, Chairman Calvert, for his leadership in drafting this 
critical bill, along with Chairwoman Kay Granger and the leadership for 
bringing this forward.
  Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Calvert just said, yes, there has been genocide, 
but the genocide has been from Hamas.
  If the world needed yet another reminder of the importance of Israel 
as a safe haven for the Jewish people, then the attacks of October 7 
should be that wake-up call.
  This is not that complicated. I have been disgusted and shocked by 
some of the things we have been hearing, including the sheer glee 
displayed in celebrations even in this country because of the murders 
on October 7.
  Remember, those grotesque celebrations and demonstrations happened 
before Israel even began its military action to defend Israelis in 
Gaza.
  Let's be clear: Those demonstrations, those statements, those 
celebrations were and are in favor of the terrorist group Hamas. The 
despicable anti-Semitism which has dramatically increased since October 
7, that we have even seen here sometimes on this floor, has to be 
condemned and has to stop.
  Israel is on the front line in the battle against terrorism--the 
terrorists of Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, you name it. All of them continue 
to wait for an opportunity to strike at Israel, as they have, just like 
they want to strike here at the American people of the United States.

  Israel and the United States do not want violence, but the problem is 
that the terrorists do, and they are the ones who have killed and 
butchered and maimed innocent Israelis.
  Last November, the House passed another Israel security supplemental, 
which was fully offset by a rescission of the IRS funding, and that was 
the reason why the White House claimed that they opposed that bill.
  Now, there are zero excuses to oppose this bill. This bill does one 
thing, Mr. Speaker. It provides urgently needed funding for our friend 
and ally, Israel, to defeat the terrorists that they are dealing with. 
The United States must stand with Israel to eradicate terrorism.
  This is not that complicated. You can use every excuse in the world 
with the purpose of supporting Hamas and justifying the murders. This 
bill stands with Israel--no ifs, no ands, no buts.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Chairman Calvert for bringing this 
important piece of legislation, and I wholeheartedly support it.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee), the distinguished ranking member of the State and 
Foreign Operations Subcommittee.

                              {time}  1745

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding and for her strong, strong leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 7217. The United States and the 
world are facing a very dangerous time, with the risk of being pulled 
deeper and deeper into conflicts across the globe. Meanwhile, millions 
of people around the world are facing violence, dislocation, and 
hunger. This bill really is not a serious effort.
  As the ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Subcommittee, I cannot support a bill that fails to meet the 
challenges of this moment and abandons those most in need of 
humanitarian assistance. Yes, this bill undermines the United States' 
policy which supports a two-state solution. This bill is a blatant 
political stunt that is dead on arrival in the Senate, and so I urge my 
colleagues to oppose it.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on 
both sides.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ellzey). The gentleman from California 
has 30 seconds remaining.
  The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 2 minutes remaining.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, a short while ago, my colleague from 
Arkansas said it is our solemn duty to protect our allies. Indeed, it 
is our solemn duty to protect our allies. Our ally in this case is 
Israel, yes, and we support Israel. Our ally is Ukraine, and we need to 
continue to support Ukraine. Our ally is Taiwan, and we need to support 
Taiwan.
  We have a solemn duty, yes, to provide humanitarian assistance to 
innocent civilians. We have a solemn duty to protect our border. These 
are not the issues that are part of this bill. This bill does not meet 
those solemn obligations.
  My Republican colleagues do not want to help Ukraine or the Indo-
Pacific and Taiwan. They do not want to address border security. They 
talked about border security as being the key to opening up the door to 
foreign assistance. They said it in the White House--the Speaker did 
that--and now they have walked away from it. It is really a political 
sham. They do not

[[Page H483]]

want to promote humanitarian assistance and leave millions of innocent 
civilians without food, shelter, and clothing.
  When I asked about Gaza in a conversation with the Director of the 
World Food Programme, Cynthia McCain, she said to me: Rosa, these 
people are starving. It is a famine. I believe that in this process of 
providing assistance to just Israel and not our other allies, they do 
hurt Israel and isolate Israel. It is time for my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to put our country and our national security 
ahead of partisan politics. What we should do is to vote this bill 
down.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  The gentlewoman is correct. This bill is not about Ukraine or 
INDOPACOM or some other things that I would love to have some 
discussions about in the future. This is about Israel.
  I think my friends on the other side of the aisle know I am not a 
cynical person. I have been in favor of moving an Israel bill for some 
time, and now is the time. I think it is just simply the right thing to 
do.
  Let's pass this bill. Let's support Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7217, the Israel 
Security Supplemental Appropriations Act. As tensions grow in the 
Middle East, the state of affairs is becoming increasingly dangerous 
for the Israeli people and United States servicemembers. Israel is our 
strongest ally in the Middle East, and the Israeli people are still 
recovering from the horrific October 7th terrorist attacks. This 
standalone Israel supplemental package ensures our great ally has the 
resources and tools they need to defeat Hamas, as well as provide 
important funding for our military forces in the region to deter 
terrorists and other enemies. The United States must send a clear 
message to the rest of the world--that we will continue to stand with 
Israel. I proudly support that message and will vote yes on this 
legislation. I encourage my colleagues to stand with our great ally 
Israel, and vote yes on this bill.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. Let me be 
absolutely clear, I vehemently oppose the ideology and actions of Hamas 
as demonstrated by my vote in favor of H. Res. 793, which, among other 
things, condemned Hamas for attacking Israel, taking hostages, and for 
threatening hostages. Moreover, I have voted in favor of over $50 
billion in funding for Israel. The Israeli people have suffered a grave 
injustice. However, committing an injustice in the name of justice is 
still an injustice. We must take care not to fall into the belief that 
any action taken in war is justified, especially the mass killing of 
innocent Palestinian babies when war has been declared on Hamas.
  Today, I am compelled to vote against the Israel Supplemental 
Legislation that Speaker Johnson brought to the floor. I take this 
stance because of the humanitarian disaster that now exists in Gaza. 
This bill's narrow focus on only providing military aid to Israel, with 
no accompanying humanitarian aid for the innocent civilians of Gaza, is 
unconscionable. I cannot ignore the men, women, and especially children 
in Gaza who are suffering through catastrophic conditions resulting 
from Israel's war on Hamas. Babies have lost their parents and parents 
have lost their children to artillery and bombs that were paid for in 
whole or in part because of U.S. funds provided to Israel. I will not 
be complicit in the slaughter of innocent babies. Furthermore, the mass 
destruction in Gaza has resulted in the decimation of homes and 
infrastructure and has made Gaza unlivable.
  The lack of meaningful humanitarian aid from this legislation at a 
time when Gazan civilians are at risk of starvation, disease, and death 
is unconscionable. For these and other reasons, I oppose this 
legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7217.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

                    CELEBRATING JAMES W. PUTNEY, JR.

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate James 
W. Putney, Jr., a veteran, patriot, and grand marshal of the 2023 
Savannah Veterans Day Parade.
  Mr. Putney proudly led the annual Veterans Day parade in Savannah, 
which is dedicated to celebrating America's heroes.
  His devout service and leadership have been evident since answering 
the call to join the United States Army at 17 years old. Over two 
decades of honorable service resulted in his retirement as a staff 
sergeant at Fort Benning, Georgia.
  In his military journey, James played vital roles as a construction 
and combat engineer. Post-retirement, he returned to his roots in 
Savannah, transitioning to a career at the Chatham County Courthouse, 
where he continued his service until 2016.
  Even in retirement, James remained actively involved in various local 
organizations, as he continues to exemplify dedication and leadership 
to his community and to his country.
  I congratulate James and thank him for his service to our country and 
our community.

                              RISING COSTS

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, listening to constituents 
is the most important thing we can do, and they are telling me back 
home about the burden of high costs.
  One constituent shared: ``I have to continue working even after 
retirement. My husband cannot afford to retire due to rising costs. I 
also have to assist my mom with her bills, which puts further strain on 
our finances.''
  Too many find it challenging to make ends meet while caring for an 
elderly parent.
  Another constituent shared: ``My income doesn't cover common life. I 
can't afford decent housing, meats at the grocery store, or basic life 
necessities. It is harder now.''
  Madam Speaker, Congress must take every possible measure to ensure 
that residents of eastern North Carolina, rural America, and those 
across America do not feel the financial strain in their pocketbooks 
and wallets.

                        RECOGNIZING DANI KUGLER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Dani Kugler of Kersey, Pennsylvania, Elk County.
  Dani currently serves as the city of St. Mary's Parks and Recreation 
director. She was recently recognized by Parks and Recreation magazine 
with the National Recreation and Parks Association's ``30 under 30'' 
award for young professionals leading the way in 2024.
  This award is given to young professionals who raise the bar for the 
parks and recreation profession. Dani was selected from a pool of over 
100 applicants and scored on the impact on the agency's community and 
service population; contributions to the professional development of 
the field of parks and recreation; and for innovative ideas, programs, 
or research in the field of parks and recreation.
  Dani was hired as the first year-round and full-time director in June 
2019. In her 5 years serving the St. Mary's area, she has established a 
strong social media presence and increased membership and program 
participation by 40 percent. She has also successfully increased the 
city's 15 summer-only program events to 45 year-round programs and 
events.
  This is the first time in St. Mary's history that its park director 
has been recognized for this award.
  I congratulate Dani on this much-deserved recognition. I look forward 
to seeing continued growth and development of the St. Mary's Parks and 
Recreation Department.

                 CELEBRATING BLACK WOMEN AT THE GRAMMYS

  (Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

[[Page H487]]

  

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Black 
women who won big at the 66th Grammy Awards, which were held in the 
heart of my district.
  Best Album nominee SZA came away with awards for Best Progressive R&B 
Album, Best R&B Song, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
  Victoria Monet became the third Black woman in 4 years to take home 
the Grammy for Best New Artist, following Samara Joy, who won Best Jazz 
Performance this year, and Megan Thee Stallion.
  At the age of 22, Tyla became the youngest South African artist in 
history to win the Best African Music Performance award for her mega-
hit, ``Water.''
  Coco Jones came away with Best R&B Performance.
  Still, the biggest awards--Best Album, Record of the Year, and Song 
of the Year--are seldom won by Black women. As Jay Z alluded to, a 
Black woman has not won the top prize, Best Album, in 25 years.
  I mean, how much lemonade do we have to make?

     SALUTING CHIEF BOBBY HUGHES OF THE EAST MEADOW FIRE DEPARTMENT

  (Mr. D'ESPOSITO asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. D'ESPOSITO. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to salute the 
long, storied career of Chief Bobby Hughes of the East Meadow Fire 
Department. He has been in the Nassau County Fire Service for over 40 
years.
  He rose through the ranks, becoming the chief of the department from 
1997 to 1998. He was instrumental in forming the East Meadow Fire 
Department Chiefs Association.
  He is the current band leader of the Nassau County Firefighters Pipes 
and Drums and led that very band down Pennsylvania Avenue for the 
inauguration of President Trump.
  He joined the Nassau County Fire Service Academy as an instructor in 
2003 and has risen through the ranks.
  This week, he will walk out of the Nassau County Fire Service Academy 
for the last time as the chief instructor. He has made it a beacon of 
education and training, not just in Nassau County but across the 
country.
  Madam Speaker, I join the Nassau County Fire Service in saluting 
Chief Bobby Hughes and thanking him for his career in keeping our 
county safe and training the future of the fire service.

 FIGHTING TO FUND UKRAINE, TAIWAN, AND HUMANITARIAN AID TO PALESTINIANS

  (Mr. LANDSMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in absolute disbelief and 
genuine disgust with what the Speaker did tonight.
  He knowingly allowed a bill to fail that would have provided critical 
support for our troops fighting terrorism in Iraq and Syria and for 
critical support for Israel. He did it because he wanted to embarrass 
Democrats.
  He also intentionally left out much-needed humanitarian aid for 
Palestinians in Gaza, essential support for Ukraine, and essential 
support for Taiwan. He chose this horrific, dangerous new brand of 
partisan politics over our troops, our allies, and millions in need.
  The fact that Palestinians need humanitarian aid, Ukraine needs to 
defend itself against Putin, and Taiwan needs support against China is 
absolutely of no interest to the Speaker.
  Representative Goldman and I attempted to amend this bill to include 
aid for all three, but we were denied.
  We will keep fighting to fund Ukraine, Taiwan, and humanitarian aid 
to Palestinians in Gaza. This is what the American people want. It is 
what our global partners need. It is what this moment requires of us.

              NEED FOR ISRAEL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I rise before the House tonight in 
support of the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.
  Israel has been our longtime ally, and they need us more than ever at 
this point with the unwarranted, unprovoked attacks that happened on 
October 7 to many, many innocent people by the terrorist group Hamas 
and others that they are surrounded by in their country.
  Israel has been under attack since the first moment of its existence 
in the 1940s, and even going back a millennia.
  Israel is a fantastic partner in developing new technologies, 
improved medical technology, improved medicines, improved drip 
irrigation, and improved missile defense systems. They are a great 
partner with us and, indeed, a shining beacon in the Middle East as a 
representative republic unlike any other there.
  Even Arab Israelis would rather live in Israel than in some of those 
other places because they know it is good, right, and just.
  It is our obligation--indeed, it is our privilege--to stand with 
Israel as an ally in their time of great need.
  Madam Speaker, we need to get over ourselves a little bit around here 
and step forward and get this work done.

                PAYING TRIBUTE TO FALLEN SERVICEMEMBERS

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the ultimate 
sacrifice made by five of our Nation's most heroic men and women in 
uniform. Each was defending liberty in dangerous territory, and each 
possessed raw courage, selflessness, and total dedication to duty for 
the sake of our Nation. Each of us is privileged to live under 
liberty's umbrella because of them.
  Special Warfare Operator First Class Christopher Chambers and Navy 
Special Warfare Operator Second Class Nathan Ingram were lost far from 
home in rough waters on the Red Sea on January 11.
  Then, 17 days later, on January 28, an enemy drone targeted Tower 22 
in Jordan. The drone operated by Iranian-backed militia terrorists 
wounded more than 40 U.S. servicemembers, killing 3 of America's 
finest: Staff Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, and 
Specialist Breonna Moffett.
  While all five hailed from different hometowns, they served together 
for one united purpose: liberty, defending America against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic.
  These brave soldiers and sailors were guarding us against the 
hastening spiderweb of terrorism and tyranny halfway around the world.
  Let us pay homage and honor each of these young men and women for 
their ultimate sacrifice. May they rest in peace.
  May God bless America.
  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my guest essay.

 Guest Essay: Establishing `Gaza-Palestinian Protectorate' Would Go a 
                                Long Way

                      (By U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur)

       Halfway around the world, the war between Hamas' terrorist 
     units and Israel is a piercing global tragedy. It demands a 
     global response. Yet, ``Peace and Justice'' have eluded 
     solution in this troubled region for over a century. It will 
     be even harder to achieve after this conflagration ends. The 
     extraordinary death toll will resound for generations 
     forward. How does one create a lasting peace borne of such 
     fierce, enduring hatreds?
       The invasion Hamas' fighters launched from Palestinian Gaza 
     into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 broke the cease-fire that had 
     tensely hung over that very troubled region. More than 1,200 
     innocent Israeli civilians were slaughtered in a barbaric 
     attack, with more than 100 Israeli and some American hostages 
     still remaining in captivity. More than 250,000 Israelis were 
     evacuated and displaced from their homes. In Gaza, 1.7 
     million Gazans have subsequently been displaced with Hamas 
     health officials claiming more than 25,000 civilians dead, 
     and more than 60,000 injured with two-thirds of the victims 
     being women and children.
       How does any army defeat a hostile enemy positioned amidst 
     a civilian population and underground in a vast ``bunker 
     city'' with miles of interconnected tunnels, dug for purposes 
     of war, not peace?
       Over 140,000 Hezbollah terrorist forces supplied by Iran, 
     are positioned in southern Lebanon, shooting rockets down on 
     Israel now. It is no accident Yemen's terrorist Houthi

[[Page H488]]

     adherents, also supplied by Iran, have been purposefully 
     shelling private cargo ships as well as targeting U.S. naval 
     vessels in the Red Sea to disrupt global trade in this 
     conflicted region. Russia's role in exacerbating resurgent 
     unrest was made clear when top Gen. Sergei Shoigu recently 
     visited Iran. And a Hamas delegation was in Moscow not long 
     after it attacked Israel.
       Across the Middle East, a spiderweb of terrorism is 
     hastening, hell-bent on evil. Iranian drones and missiles are 
     being used against Ukraine, Israel, the United States, and 
     our allies in Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Jordan. North Korean 
     missiles are likewise in use against Ukraine. The global 
     distinction between tyranny and liberty could not be clearer. 
     The world community of nations must not allow terrorist 
     forces enabled by Iran and Russia to foment unrest and 
     carnage. The sacred boundaries of nations must be respected, 
     defended, and enforced.
       The history of the Middle East instructs that former 
     adversarial nations can make peace among themselves. For 
     nearly five decades, dating back to my days of service in the 
     Carter administration, proposals for a two-State solution 
     have been advanced for Israel and Palestine.
       Ironically, the depth and brutality of this present 
     conflict may create an opening for a far-reaching solution. 
     If the world community could spend as much money on peace as 
     it has on war, both the Israelis and Palestinians could have 
     thriving homelands.
       To move forward, I propose that the United Nations, or a 
     coalition of willing nations, begin to negotiate a ``Gaza-
     Palestinian Protectorate.'' The parties involved should aim 
     to negotiate a long-lasting solution to the conflict in Gaza, 
     address challenges in the West Bank, and divide the contested 
     territory securing their existence with an International 
     Multilateral Security Force to separate warring factions.
       If the civilized world could achieve this with a divided 
     Korea, why not with Palestine and Israel?
       The goals of the Protectorate would be fourfold:
       (1) an international coalition of nations should be 
     assembled and involved in organizing its administration and 
     staffing;
       (2) Gaza would be demilitarized of weapons, war, tunnels, 
     and fortifications;
       (3) Hamas would have no role, politically, 
     administratively, or economically;
       (4) Palestinians from Gaza should be involved in the 
     administration of the Protectorate's on-site operations, 
     including its police forces.
       The Protectorate would have three immediate tasks. The 
     first would be to quickly secure resources and provide food, 
     water, shelter, and medical care to the almost 2.3 million 
     people of Gaza.
       The second is to provide an international military 
     coalition that can demilitarize Gaza as quickly as possible. 
     Gaza must never again be a threat to its neighbors.
       The third is to physically separate Gaza and Israel, by 
     creating a demilitarized zone between the two, that is 
     virtually impenetrable, as is the DMZ between North and South 
     Korea. As part of the separation, the infrastructure to 
     provide water, sewage treatment, and energy needed by Gaza 
     should be located in Gaza and staffed by the people of Gaza.
       One of the long-term missions could be to rebuild what is 
     now a destroyed area under a new vision of peace and 
     prosperity. Gaza has many undeveloped resources, the primary 
     of which is its land and location. While small in size, Gaza 
     is located in one of the most attractive parts of the 
     Mediterranean, with miles of undeveloped, beautiful beaches 
     that could become a recreational center of the region.
       With peace and stability, Gaza could become a financial and 
     economic hub that attracts capital and businesses from around 
     the world. Gaza and the West Bank have the thousands of 
     workers needed to rebuild what has been destroyed along with 
     necessary staff to renew the economy. A ``Gaza Development 
     Authority'' as part of the Protectorate could create and 
     administer a long-term development plan to bring prosperity 
     and transparency that would forestall the corruption that so 
     often accompanies unfettered development.
       Hope must arise from this cruel war. Old diplomacy, and old 
     solutions should be shelved. They should be replaced with a 
     forward-looking approach that could bring peace, justice, and 
     prosperity to this war-torn region. Succeeding would give 
     hope to a civilized world that hungers for peace in these 
     troubled lands.

                  PRAISING ILWACO COMMUNITY RESILIENCY

  (Ms. PEREZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PEREZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in praise of the resilience of 
my community in southwest Washington.
  Last month, a fire broke out at one of two seafood processing 
facilities near the Port of Ilwaco in my district. In the aftermath of 
the catastrophic fire, the unity and support demonstrated by the Ilwaco 
community have been remarkable.
  Whereas lesser men would have seen an opportunity for competitive 
advantage, these folks chose to stand together and see each other as 
neighbors, lending out crab pots to each other, which they didn't have 
to do.
  I am incredibly grateful to come from a community that supports each 
other in the wake of a tragedy. Their community spirit is a competitive 
advantage that money cannot buy and natural disasters cannot shake.
  I extend my thanks to the brave first responders who responded to the 
fire. Several of them were treated for heat exhaustion, a testament to 
their tireless effort in combating the blaze for hours.
  I also recognize the folks in Ilwaco who stepped up to help local 
crabbers, dropping off sandwiches and shipping up crab pots from as far 
as California and Alaska.
  Rebuilding and recovery will take time. They will never get back 
those hours of sleep, the heartache, or the monetary loss, but their 
moral fiber has been revealed in a way that is durable and will 
strengthen the community. It is its own reward.
  Madam Speaker, I stand with them in their fight, and I am so grateful 
for their leadership.

                 SUPPORTING ISRAEL, UKRAINE, AND TAIWAN

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the skullduggery of the Speaker of the 
House was on display today. He has no real interest in helping Israel. 
He has interest in scoring political points with Donald Trump. He used 
Israel to do that today, and he did it a month ago.
  A month ago or so, he said he would support aid to Israel if it was 
set off with $13 million or $14 million in cuts to the IRS, which would 
have only benefited the wealthiest tax cheats in our country. To 
condition aid to Israel on helping out rich tax cheats is despicable, 
and the skullduggery today was to separate Israel from Ukraine, a 
country similar to Israel that is being invaded by Russia to try to 
deny its territorial integrity and to commit a genocide, just as Hamas 
has tried to commit a genocide in Israel.
  I support Israel. I also support helping with humanitarian aid the 
people in Gaza who have been hurt, injured, or killed. I also support 
helping Ukraine for having Russia do the same thing. I also support 
Taiwan.
  I do not support the Speaker. He is a man without good faith.

                        FUNDING FOR ALL IN NEED

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, the American people might wonder just 
what happened here today.
  Well, first of all, the southern border deal never got anywhere, and 
all of the logistics and all of the cloak and dagger and what was going 
to be in it failed to even get the attention of the Speaker of this 
House or any of the Republican Members.
  Yet, all of a sudden, an unfounded legislative initiative that was 
allegedly to advocate for the needs of the people in the Mideast wound 
up on the floor of the House. You wonder what we did today. It wound up 
on the floor of the House with no conscience, no thought, no 
commitment, and that is why I was not able to vote for it.
  I was willing to join an amended initiative to ensure that all of the 
people that are in need in the Mideast would be taken care of; that we 
would have the funding for Israel; that we would have the funding for 
the Palestinians and the aid that is needed in Gaza and the ability to 
deal with the crisis of debt that they have been facing; that we would 
have the money for Taiwan; and, yes, that we would have the money for 
Ukraine.
  I have been to the border of Ukraine. I have seen the violence 
against the children. I have seen Russia steal children. I have seen 
parents die in the streets. It is necessary that we do this right, and 
that is funding for all of those that are in need, and do it now.
  The Speaker of the House needs to work in a professional way for the

[[Page H489]]

American people to show we care about the nations and we care about the 
Mideast.

                         POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Hageman). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 9, 2023, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DeSaulnier) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 6 years ago, I held a Special Order on 
a subject matter that I think is extremely important to this country 
and the developed world, the issue of growing inequality. It has been 4 
years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and it is more relevant now 
than ever because, unfortunately, it has gotten worse.
  The concentration of wealth in the United States of America is not 
fair, it is not American, and it is driving multiple social and 
behavioral health issues that more and more research points to and 
verifies.
  The pandemic has laid bare the deep disparities that exist in the 
United States and worsened the gap between the richest and poorest 
Americans, and it has helped eviscerate in many ways the American 
middle class.
  The President has tried his very best and, in the 2 years that 
Democrats had control of both Houses and the President was in the White 
House, we did much to begin to change this rising tide of inequality. 
Rising inequality incurs costs that harm us all, but not just those at 
the bottom of the income distribution; it hurts America.
  Next to me is a statistical diagram of the Gini quotient that is 
accepted by economists around the world as the best statistical 
measurement for inequality. As you can see, just since 1993, it has 
steadily gone up with the pandemic at the end.
  I am pleased to have a couple of my colleagues and friends to be here 
to speak on this. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) 
to make a few comments.
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
pleased to join you because this is such an important topic and a topic 
that I have been talking about for a long time.
  The income inequality in our country has grown and grown, and the tax 
cuts of Donald Trump, which I voted against, contributed to it 
greatly--tax cuts that gave the wealthy much more money, corporations 
and individuals, and did not help the poor and didn't really help the 
middle class much.
  My district is in Memphis, Shelby County and Tipton County, just 
north of Memphis. Because of that, I am no stranger to high levels of 
poverty and inequality.
  According to the 2023 Poverty Fact Sheet by the University of 
Memphis, 21.4 percent of Memphians live in poverty. The overall poverty 
rate for Black and Latino Memphians is almost double that of White and 
Caucasian residents; roughly 27 percent for Black and Latino residents, 
compared to 10 percent of Whites.
  The child poverty rate is 32.7, a number that has been declining in 
recent years due to the child tax credits, but still far too high, and 
we don't know how much the child tax credits will be available to 
people this coming year.
  In 2022, the child poverty rate in African-American and Latino 
communities was three times that of White families, 30 percent to 10. 
What hope does that give young African-American and Latino children?
  The root causes of poverty often come down to access and opportunity. 
Childhood poverty is directly related to the financial status of the 
children's parents.

  Many young adults in Memphis have parents and grandparents who are 
prohibited from buying houses in certain areas, redlining, which is 
still a practice in Memphis, and has been highlighted recently when one 
of the banks in Memphis was charged with such and pled guilty to such, 
I believe. That has restricted access to home loans and mortgage 
protections, as well.
  Because of redlining, many families did not have the opportunity to 
buy desirable houses. These policies were legal until 1968, so it is 
not ancient history.
  The impact of redlining continues as many families were unable to 
build generational wealth.
  Now, poor families need access to services like citywide internet, 
subsidized childcare, and supportive mortgage rates.
  And we tried to do some of those things, but unfortunately, it has 
not been a bipartisan effort. It has mostly been an effort by 
Democrats.
  Tennessee is nationally ranked as a low-tax State, but that is not 
the case for the poorest families. The taxes are regressive. It is a 
sales tax-dependent State that taxes the poor in the most regressive 
manner.
  The poorest 20 percent of Tennessee residents pay a significantly 
higher percentage of their income in State and local taxes than any 
other group in the State.
  Low-income families are paying high amounts of taxes, while at the 
same time receiving lower levels of access to services and 
opportunities for economic mobility. Tennessee remains one of the 10 
remaining States that have not expanded Medicaid. That is truly 
sorrowful and immoral.
  If Tennessee were to expand, as 40 other States and the District of 
Columbia have, lower earning workers would have access to affordable 
healthcare, and their families would worry less about the impacts of 
seeking treatment for an illness.
  A billion-plus dollars a year have been turned down by our State 
legislature because they don't care about taking care of the poor.
  Matthew 25 talks about healing. I saw people that were naked, and I 
clothed them. I saw people that were hungry, and I fed them. I saw 
people who were sick, and I healed them.
  Some people say they live by the Bible. If you want to know where my 
politics are just look to the Bible. Well, some of those people who 
speak it the most don't know Matthew 25.
  Measures combating childhood poverty and closing the income/wealth 
gap among diverse groups are vital in my district, enough to make more 
progress on the issue.
  I will continue advocating for the child tax credit, which Ms. 
DeLauro has championed, encouraging Tennessee to expand Medicaid, 
seeking additional funds for education and job training, and supporting 
other policies to help those in need.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. DeSaulnier for having the moral courage 
and the will to bring this Special Order to the people that are 
watching. It is an important issue, and it pains me to see our country 
becoming more and more divided.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I will now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who was someone who spoke at my first effort 
at this, the very esteemed ranking member of the Appropriations 
Committee.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much for 
yielding. I so appreciate what he is accomplishing here this evening as 
to shine a light on the issue of poverty in this Nation. You know, we 
have searched and searched and searched over decades for what the 
antidote is to poverty and, particularly, child poverty.
  I am often reminded--this might sound a little nerdy, but the Nobel 
laureate in economics, Joseph Stiglitz--and this is a paraphrase of 
what he said--that inequality is not the result of globalization or 
modernization, but it is the result of policy choices.
  This body that we are blessed to serve in deals with policy choices, 
which means that we can have a profound effect on poverty, child 
poverty, and reducing that in our Nation.
  I suppose I will just reflect and pick up a little on what 
Congressman Cohen said. The House passed a tax bill last week that 
would continue to exacerbate child poverty in the United States--public 
policy choices.
  Madam Speaker, I say thank you to Mr. DeSaulnier for bringing us 
together tonight. As I stated last week,

[[Page H490]]

in good conscience, I couldn't vote for a deal that was so lopsidedly 
benefiting big corporations while failing to ensure a substantial tax 
cut to middle- and working-class families.
  It was deeply inequitable. We have seen the greatest rise in 
inequality, and we have seen corporations make super profits at the 
expense of the consumer. For me, it was a mockery of who representative 
government works for.
  Who are we here to support?
  The bill delivers massive tax cuts for big corporations, and it 
denies middle-class families economic security that they had, and we 
were successful with, in the American Rescue Plan.
  We were successful in having a child tax credit, and to be truthful, 
I started out wanting to make it permanent. I was told that it was too 
expensive; that it should be for 5 years. They said: No, it can't be 
for 5 years. What about 3 years? No, it can't be 3 years. I said: 1 
year? I was asked: Will you take 1 year? Of course, with the expanded 
child tax credit, you received $3,000 for kids 6 to 17; $3,600 for 6 
years and under, monthly benefits for a family, so I said yes.
  Then I was also told, at that time: Rosa, once it is out there, it is 
not going to go away. It went away. It expired. We had a chance last 
week to redress that balance and bring it back, and in my view that was 
a missed opportunity.
  Once again, it is their taking away, pulling the rug out from under 
working families, middle-class families, vulnerable families, and 
driving them into poverty, once again, because we had reduced the 
poverty rate.
  That is what the bill did. Now, it has gone from 5.2 percent to 12.4 
percent. Hunger has risen, and it went down when we had the child tax 
credit. The tax credit was the largest middle-class tax cut in history.

                              {time}  1930

  We got billions of dollars in tax relief for the wealthy and, the way 
I put it, pennies for the poor. That is what it is about.
  If you want to talk about cost benefit, the child tax credit returns 
$8 for every dollar spent. Child poverty in the United States costs us 
a trillion dollars every year, and we would return 84 cents on the 
dollar to the taxpayer with the child tax credit.
  You know, it is a vast giveaway to billionaires and corporations. 
Just a couple of examples. DISH Network, FedEx, Salesforce, T-Mobile, 
these corporations pay no Federal income tax under the Trump tax law.
  Think about it for a second. Netflix will have a negative tax rate in 
2024 and 2025 because of this tax bill. That means that they get money 
back. They pay no taxes. On top of that, in November 2023 they 
announced they would raise prices on subscribers, adding an extra $24 
to $36 to what subscribers have to pay each year to maintain service. 
Yet, these same families will not see a child tax credit like they did 
under the American Rescue Plan.
  It is absurd. Think about what people are telling you, my colleague 
in California and my colleague in Tennessee. Families today are living 
paycheck to paycheck. If something goes wrong, they can't make a $400 
payment. That is what is going on in their lives. They are struggling 
to put food on the table, to pay their healthcare bills, to be able to 
get childcare. Groceries have skyrocketed. It is all there. Childcare 
has skyrocketed.
  Corporate profits, though, were $3 trillion in 2023. They are not 
living paycheck to paycheck. They are going to take that money and buy 
back stock, which is what they have done in the past with this thing. 
It is our families that are bearing the brunt of inflation and high 
interest rates.
  The child tax credit is the answer to child poverty in this country. 
It is a successful tool that lifted millions out of poverty literally 
overnight.
  What has happened happened. We move forward, and we will continue to 
make the fight for a permanent child tax credit in this country because 
we know how successful it was. We know what it did for families. To the 
naysayers who said, one, we couldn't raise it to $3,000 or $3,600 and 
that we could never get it monthly, well, so be it, we did it, and it 
succeeded. There were those who said that people are going to dog it, 
they are not going to go to work, they are going to buy drugs with it.
  There is data from the Columbia School of Social Policy that said 
people went to work because they could afford childcare, and they were 
able to use this money for essentials, necessities, to buy those 
groceries, and maybe for their kid they could send them on a class trip 
which they weren't able to do because they couldn't afford it in the 
past.
  It is the best thing that we can do to improve the economic well-
being and security of American families today. Let's bring back the 
largest middle class tax cut in the history of this country.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to continue to shine the light that it is our 
public policy decisions that create inequity and inequality. Let's turn 
that around and deal with the policies that do turn that around. I 
can't thank the gentleman enough for putting together this Special 
Order.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, some people on the other side accuse us 
of socialism. The gentlewoman and I learned our rosary in our Catholic 
and Christian upbringing. It was about the social contract of St. 
Matthew, and in the Bible it says: To those who much is given, much is 
expected.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Our Catholicism is rich with social justice, and I look 
at ``In God We Trust,'' and this body really needs to carry out social 
justice in a way that it doesn't do these days.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. You can have individual responsibility in this 
country, and you can have social responsibility. That is when we have 
been the most successful.
  When Eisenhower was President, when the middle class was strong and 
the union movement was strong, people got the GI Bill, and he 
implemented in his own way what Franklin Roosevelt put together. That 
is when this economy was the best. It was growing at over 6 percent GDP 
year over year, and it was benefiting everybody.
  I tell you, one of the things that brought me to this was when I was 
a Republican restaurant owner, you would read in the trade journals 
about disposable income. This is our friend Bob Reich's argument and 
Stiglitz' argument: If you don't have disposable income, it hurts 
everybody.
  Unfortunately, now people in places like the Roosevelt Institute, our 
friends, say that, no, more and more the top 1 percent is just selling 
to themselves and gaining themselves off.
  As Thomas Piketty has said, the inevitability in Western history, 
when you get to this level of inequality, is social disruption and 
civil distress. If we don't fix it here, we will have more of what 
happened a few years ago outside this Chamber.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Amen. I thank my colleague.
  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I am going to go through my 
presentation, but I do want to thank my two colleagues. There may be 
one or two others on the way.
  I will start by talking about poverty in America. I am going to date 
myself again. Michael Harrington, ``The Other America,'' talked about 
poverty over 50 years ago about how people in rural America were 
suffering, but we had the optics of how well people were doing in 
places where we are fortunate enough where many of us live, but it was 
rural America that Michael Harrington talked about. Again, he was 
talking about the social contract in the Gospel of Matthew.
  Nearly 40 million people, or 11 percent of the U.S. population, lived 
in poverty in 2021. One in three Americans live in a household making 
$55,000 or less, and while many of them are technically above the 
official poverty line, they are still struggling to make ends meet, 
that $400 in unexpected expense.
  In 2019, the U.S. child poverty rate was double that of our peer 
nations including Germany, Canada, and South Korea. The relief we 
delivered to families during the pandemic made a massive impact on 
people's lives, including the leadership of Ms. DeLauro. The expanded 
child tax credit, which she mentioned, robust unemployment insurance, 
and emergency rental assistance all helped to keep families afloat 
during unprecedented economic hardship in an international pandemic.
  Now we are coming out of it, and those funds are going away. They did 
their intended purpose, but now we are at a tipping point.

[[Page H491]]

  The expanded child tax credit alone led to a stunning reduction in 
child poverty. This effort, spearheaded by my good friend Ms. DeLauro, 
kept 5.3 million people above the poverty line. Between 2020 and 2021, 
the child poverty rate plunged to 4.5 percentage points. As Ms. DeLauro 
said, they weren't spending this on anything but trying to survive--
provide shelter, transportation, and get to work--for their family and 
their kids.
  After House Republicans allowed the child tax credit to expire, the 
poverty rate for children more than doubled, from the historic low of 
5.2 percent in 2021 to 12.4 percent the next year. If the child tax 
credit had been sustained at the levels from the pandemic, 3 million 
additional American children would have been kept out of poverty. I 
wonder what they are doing this evening.
  According to the analysis of the Center for Budget and Policy 
Priorities, with the child tax credit in 2021, in 6 months we reduced 
child poverty by almost half.
  Mr. Speaker, we know how to do this. We know what works. We just have 
to invest and prioritize, lifting up the most vulnerable people amongst 
us. What will they do? The vast majority will work and be honorable and 
take that money for a very high return on investment for all of us.
  Wealth distribution. As you can see in this chart, data from the 
Congressional Budget Office shows that from 1989 to 2019, the total 
wealth held by families in the top 10 percent increased by 240 percent, 
from about $24 trillion to $82 trillion, while the wealth held by 
families in other percentiles increased far more slowly or even 
remained flat.
  Wealth is skewed to the top of the wealth distribution in the United 
States of America. Families in the top 10 percent of distribution have 
held more than two-thirds of all wealth, and families in the bottom 
half of the distribution held only 2 percent of total wealth.
  I, like most Americans, want people to be compensated for their 
creativity, for their innovation and hard work, but this distribution 
punishes 90 percent of the American public and even higher when you get 
deeper into the numbers.
  The total wealth held by American families tripled from 1989 to 2019, 
but the growth was far from uniform for everyone. Over those three 
decades, 30 years, families in the top 10 percent saw their share of 
wealth increase by around 30 percent.
  For families in the bottom half of the wealth distribution, their 
share declined from 4 percent to just 2 percent. Even before the 
pandemic started, which we know has worsened this, the concentration of 
wealth among those at the very top has gotten significantly worse.
  This is not about class warfare. This is about fighting for all of 
us. This has been true in our history. When we went through the gilded 
age, a similar thing happened. We had the Depression and two World 
Wars. Who fought those wars? Who fought to try to get back so that they 
could take care of their families? Not the wealthiest, but most 
Americans who are going out and working hard to get a paycheck.
  As Ms. DeLauro said, unfortunately, history is repeating itself, and 
my fear is coming out of the pandemic, even with our growth, even with 
what the President has done, with unemployment at historic lows and 
wages coming up, it is not enough. We have to change this, and it 
should be on a bipartisan, analytical basis in this House and in this 
Congress.
  What we have done has had real impacts on those who were left out. It 
is not just that those at the top are better off than everyone else, as 
the richest among us are able to concentrate their wealth. They lock 
away their money in investments that research shows never gets spent in 
the economy. Middle-income people spend their money. They consume. They 
go to restaurants. That is better for everybody. With wealthier people, 
as researched by Stiglitz and others, that wealth is generally retained 
in that group of people, and it is even more so. It is becoming more 
concentrated as they spend money amongst themselves and leave everyone 
else out.
  As inequality increases, it becomes more difficult for those not born 
into privilege to climb the ladder and build a better life, further 
enriching and growing inequality. This country is supposed to be merit 
and hard work and equality of opportunity. We are doing the opposite 
right now in this country, and it is because of policies here.

  Let's talk about worker compensation. This is not worker compensation 
as when you get injured, although that should be better, this is wages 
versus capital. In Lincoln's first address to Congress before the Civil 
War when he was trying to hold the country together, he famously said: 
Wages--labor, in his word--and capital must always be equal and 
balanced in the United States for if capital ever becomes dominant, we 
have lost democracy.
  Despite working harder, despite being more educated, despite being 
more productive, the wages of most American workers have grown 
exceptionally slowly compared to the growth in productivity compared to 
the CEO compensation. For the last 40 years, the gap between 
productivity and worker compensation--wages--has increased 
significantly. Americans are working in a more productive fashion. They 
are working more productively versus their international competitors, 
but they are not seeing their wages go up, and their disposable income 
sacrifice is even more.
  A typical worker's wage growth has lagged far behind gains in 
productivity over that time. The idea that if you worked harder and 
were more productive, individual merit and responsibility is not borne 
out in the research and the numbers.
  If we look at this graph, we can see productivity has grown by nearly 
62 percent over the last 40 years, but the average hourly pay of the 
typical worker grew by only 17 percent. This gap makes the difference 
between people being compensated fairly in their wages versus people 
who have the good fortune to be able to invest in capital, and this is 
what Lincoln was talking about.
  Put simply, workers are more productive than ever before but are not 
properly compensated for it. Until the late 1970s, workers' 
compensation--wages--climbed together with productivity, but then it 
began to change and diverge. It diverges when we abandon the policies 
that prioritize spreading the benefits of growth to workers, to all 
Americans, wealthy and middle-income, instead of what we are doing now. 
It benefited from a strong labor movement.
  President Eisenhower once famously said: Only a fool would try to 
keep an American worker from joining a labor union. President 
Eisenhower said that.

                              {time}  1945

  CEO pay: Another contributor to rising inequality is rising CEO pay. 
This is an ongoing issue, but it is something we have really seen 
balloon over the last 3 years. While so many hardworking Americans have 
struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic, some CEOs are making 
more money than ever.
  The average top CEO compensation in 2022 was $25.2 million, and it 
continues to increase even as low-income Americans and middle-income 
Americans are forced to make do with wages that, year after year, 
afford them less in terms of purchasing power.
  In 2022, CEOs were paid 344 times as much as a typical worker. The 
ratio of CEO to typical compensation was 344 to 1. In 1989, that ratio 
was 59 to 1. In the fifties and sixties, it was even lower. In 1965, it 
was 21 to 1.
  I have introduced the CEO Accountability and Responsibility Act, 
which would increase corporate taxes on companies with extreme 
disparities between their CEO and their workers' pay.
  We need bold proposals like this one to help put an end to runaway 
corporate greed and restore the balance of power back to workers--a 
balance, as Lincoln said.
  Stock buybacks: Over the last 40 years, tax laws, regulatory changes, 
court decisions, and new corporate behaviors have led to shareholder-
first corporations--that is the corporate veil they hide behind--where 
CEOs and managers focus on share price and investors, directing 
corporate funds to shareholder payouts.
  Corporate profits or even corporate debt may have once funded 
innovative new projects in research and development, new hires, worker 
wages, or, like the Germans do, reinvested in continuous training back 
in the community

[[Page H492]]

colleges and apprenticeship programs for a lifetime of learning for 
workers and craftsmen.
  In the 1960s and 1970s, 40 cents was invested for every dollar a 
company earned or borrowed. Since the 1980s, less than 10 cents of each 
borrowed dollar is invested that way.
  Instead, executives are using the profits to pay themselves and their 
wealthy shareholders. Over the past 30 years, payouts to wealthy 
shareholders have averaged 90 percent of all corporate profits. We need 
Robin Hood.
  This has led to skyrocketing use of stock buybacks, when companies 
purchase back their own stock from shareholders in an open market and 
reabsorb the ownership that was previously sold to other investors.
  The use of stock buybacks was essentially banned except under rare 
circumstances until Ronald Reagan and his Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1982, a strategy for companies to artificially raise 
their open market stock prices and boost earnings per share.
  In 1982, during the Reagan administration, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission passed a rule that deregulated buybacks, allowing 
companies to buy their own stock without being charged with stock 
manipulation, and incentivizing them, as Ms. DeLauro said, to avoid 
taxes.
  Where did those taxes go? Not to all of us but back to the top 1 
percent and their investors. Again, Lincoln: Wages and capital should 
be balanced.
  The increased stock prices do not reflect an actual improvement in 
the processes of the company and may serve as a cover for financial 
difficulties in the long run.
  This is why I think Republicans and Democrats should be concerned--
perhaps for different reasons and motivations--but the underlying rot 
in our economy is a problem, as exemplified by Thomas Piketty and as he 
illustrated in his detailed history of other economies when this 
happened around the world.
  Stock buybacks are just an excuse for companies to reward 
stockholders and increase dividends while avoiding employee wages and 
compensation and investments back into their companies.
  In an investigation of 449 companies listed on the S&P from 2003 to 
2012, companies used 54 percent of earnings to buy back their own stock 
and 37 percent on dividends of those earnings.
  The increased use of stock buybacks by corporations is a way that 
companies pad their profits and their mediocre corporate management and 
support their executives at the expense of all of us and their workers.
  Over the last 5 years, the top 20 S&P 500 companies spent a 
staggering $1.24 trillion buying back their own shares.
  Last year, Chevron, which is headquartered in my district, said it 
would triple its budget for stock buybacks from $75 billion, and Meta, 
the parent of Facebook, which is near my district in the bay area, 
unveiled a $40 billion buyback.
  The Brookings Institute looked at the actions of 22 iconic American 
corporations that alone employ over 7 million frontline workers, 
including the world's most popular brands in retail, delivery, and 
entertainment sectors like Amazon, Disney, FedEx, Home Depot, and 
Hilton.
  In the first 2 years of the pandemic, they earned even more. In that 
time period, company shareholders at these companies grew $1.5 trillion 
richer while workers got less than 2 percent of the benefit.
  $1.5 trillion and 2 percent of the benefit for their workforce 
doesn't sound like what Lincoln wanted. They spent nearly 40 percent of 
their profit on stock buybacks.
  Rising shareholder payouts are linked with declining employee 
compensation and increased income inequality. Gains of stock buybacks 
are also concentrated amongst the already uber-wealthy. Around 58 
percent of American households own stock. That is good. About 93 
percent of households' stock market wealth is held by the top 10 
percent.
  While our investment in good, strong pensions and retirement--I am 
proud to be the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Health, 
Employment, Labor, and Pensions of the Education and the Workforce 
Committee. Those investments in everybody's pensions are good. They 
benefit everybody.
  The problem is, most of those investments are going to the wealthiest 
among us, and it creates risk for all of us when this stops and is not 
handled appropriately for everyone's benefit.

  An analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies showed that the 
richest 10 percent of U.S. households own roughly $42.7 trillion in 
stock market wealth, and the richest 1 percent own $25 trillion.
  The bottom half of households own less than half a trillion dollars. 
The top 1 percent owns $25 trillion in the stock market, just 1 percent 
of stock market wealth. Sad.
  Corporations are spending more and more of their net incomes on 
buybacks rather than innovation and capital improvements and 
compensating their workers well for more productivity and, ultimately, 
more innovation and more disposable income for people like myself when 
I was in the restaurant business to go out and support those other 
jobs.
  Corporations are spending more and more of their net income for 
buybacks in recent years to enrich their executives and their 
shareholders. It comes at a real cost for their employees who have 
decidedly not seen the same kind of increases in their take-home pay, 
their disposable income, or their ability to go out and consume and 
take care of their kids.
  Labor unions and strikes: Workers across industries are fed up with 
lagging wages and the benefits that are disproportionately given to the 
top 1 percent.
  This year, more workers are recognizing their collective bargaining 
power and are walking off the job or threatening to do so to fight for 
their rights. In Hollywood, in auto factories, in food service across 
the country, workers are fighting for fair compensation, safe 
workplaces, and job security.
  Public approval for labor unions in this country has skyrocketed to 
over 60 percent. Americans are waking up to these disparities, the 
unfairness, and the lack of us supporting the American Dream for 
everybody and rewarding hard work and responsibility.
  There is outside influence of the uber-wealthy in elections right 
here in this House. It has been a big issue in the United States and 
has drastically expanded since the 5-4 Supreme Court decision on 
Citizens United, allowing for independent expenditures.
  The Citizens United decision enabled corporations and other outside 
groups to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.
  It opened the door to unlimited donations to super-PACs, which 
function as a surrogate to campaigns despite being banned from 
coordinating directly with them.
  These numbers have skyrocketed. The impacts have been far-reaching 
and continue to get worse every election cycle.
  Billionaires alone provided 15 percent of all Federal midterm 
election financing in 2022, according to a Brennan Center analysis. 
Just 21 of the biggest donor families, 21 families, each spent at least 
$15 million in one election cycle, or a total of $783 million in that 
cycle.
  Do you see the connection between our policy and how people get here 
and stay here?
  The effective deregulation of campaign money and the expansion of 
dark money groups that don't have to disclose their donors are 
destructive to democracy, clearly.
  Citizens United has helped reinforce the view that our government 
primarily serves the interests of the rich, all of our government, all 
three branches all too often, and that there is no need for most 
citizens to participate in democracy.
  Those are the economic and social concerns that I have and what we 
are under. It doesn't sound good.
  Now, there is more and more research on the connection to you as 
individuals in this country, to the people who despair, the so-called 
diseases and deaths of despair that are all too frequent in rural areas 
in the Midwest and the South regionally, but they are all across the 
country, including in the bay area, which I represent.
  Behavioral health, substance abuse, and opioid addictions have been 
well recorded by research and writing. This, to me, is where the 
tragedy of tragedies is far beyond policy. It is the reality of how 
Americans have to live,

[[Page H493]]

that $400, the despair, the anxiety, and the distrust in this 
institution.
  As my friend and colleague Elijah Cummings used to say all the time, 
we are better than this, Republicans and Democrats.
  Let's talk about health consequences of inequality. It is important 
to look at the effect it has on health, physically and mentally, and on 
the fabric of our society. Economic inequality is a cause of poor 
health. As one English researcher said 20 years ago, inequality in a 
society is in lockstep with individual suffering.
  As the gap between the richest and the poorest Americans gets larger, 
the health discrepancies between these groups increase as well, and 
they are getting exponentially worse.

  As health declines, it has adverse effects on quality of life, our 
economy, our workforce productivity, and our healthcare costs.
  Life expectancy in the United States has been declining for decades. 
A lot of this is directly attributable to these diseases of despair.
  It has only worsened since the beginning of the pandemic. I thought 
we would come together, but instead, it has gotten worse.
  There are stark differences in the average life expectancies of 
Americans at the bottom of the income distribution and those at the 
top. The health of the wealthiest Americans has remained relatively 
stagnant, while that of the poorest Americans has fallen significantly.
  In spite of the ACA, we are still spending the most as a percentage 
of GDP on quality healthcare. Unfortunately, if you are wealthy, even 
with the ACA, you are going to get better healthcare in a caste system 
of healthcare, which will cause your own life expectancy to go down.
  This is a regional problem, and there are differences in regional 
problems as exemplified in an extensive study by the Kaiser Foundation.
  There is a strong relationship to the level of income inequality and 
the percentage of population that suffers from mental health issues, so 
it is physical health and mental health. The prevalence of anxiety 
disorders, impulse control disorders, and even severe mental health 
illnesses are correlated to inequality.
  Chronic stress or lack of social support increases the risk of ill 
health, both physical and mental. The CDC has recently highlighted the 
concerning trend--not concerning trend, the outrage of the mental 
health of high school students, our kids, which was worsened by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

                              {time}  2000

  In 2021, more than 4 in 10 students felt persistently sad or hopeless 
and depressed. More than 1 in 5 seriously considered attempting 
suicide, particularly for young women, as the CDC and the Surgeon 
General has pointed out to us.
  This is a crisis, Mr. Speaker. For all of us who are fortunate to 
have kids, we should be extremely sensitive to what we are giving as a 
legacy and the tragedy that we are committing to the future of this 
country and young people, irrespective of where they live or which 
party their families and parents are registered to.
  We should be doing a lot more to support mental health and behavioral 
health in this country, and that includes making mental health care 
more affordable and more accessible.
  Since the ACA imparity, there has been a 300 percent increase in 
people seeking out behavioral health. There has been a similar decrease 
in the number of young people going into the field because of the 
exorbitant cost of getting a degree.
  Talk about supply and demand.
  Social support and social networks are important for psychological 
well-being. Both are individuals in this country, and there is a very 
tied connection.
  These are important determinants of population health, and they 
deteriorate in unequal societies.
  Aggressively targeting income inequality will lead to better health 
outcomes for more Americans.
  The same research by English experts years ago said that, again, 
there was a correlation between both, but they also said the remedy was 
not just more services. The biggest, most effective remedy is dealing 
with the societal tax and regulatory impact of this concentration of 
wealth and continuing to reward it.
  So let's talk about global income inequality, because America, as bad 
as we are, and we have led on this unfortunately, it is an economic 
toll across the country and the developed world.
  The rest of the developed world, as you have heard me say, creates 
more safety nets, but it is still a problem in a global economy.
  The economic toll of the pandemic has been highly unequal. A report 
from March of 2020 to the end of 2020, global billionaire wealth--
global, not the U.S., the previous numbers were in the U.S.--has 
increased by almost $4 trillion.
  By contrast, global workers combined earnings fell by $3.7 trillion.
  Individuals owning more than 100,000 in assets make up 13 percent of 
the global population, but they own 85.2 percent of the global wealth.
  Globalism did not raise all boats, as we were promised. Our rising 
tide, as Jack Kennedy said many years ago, in this economy globally and 
in the United States, turns out has only raised those with the very 
biggest yachts.
  Having said all that, wealth concentration in the U.S. is worse.
  Statistics show the top 1 percent of the United States holds 40 
percent of the national wealth, a far greater share than in other 
developed countries. In other industrialized nations, the richest 1 
percent own 27 percent. Pretty bad, but not as bad as 40 percent.
  U.S. median wealth is lower than in many other countries. The United 
States has more wealth than any other nation. The wealthiest country in 
the history of the world, but the top-heavy distribution of wealth 
leaves typical American adults with far less wealth than their 
counterparts in other individual countries.
  Changes to tax policy that benefit the rich and large corporations 
are the key driver, as Ms. DeLauro said, in rising inequality. Our 
actions here, particularly under the last administration, not only 
increased the deficit dramatically but they increased the lopsidedness 
of fairness in the American economy and politics.
  According to the Institute for Policy Studies analysis by data 
collected by a known, wonderful economist, Emmanuel Saez, a neighbor 
who teaches at the University of California at Stanford, the share of 
U.S. taxes paid by the top 1 percent was just slightly higher in 2018 
than in 1962, despite the more than tripling of their share of the 
Nation's wealth.
  By contrast, the bottom 50 percent saw their share of U.S. wealth 
drop by more than half during this period. The top marginal rate in 
1962 was 91 percent compared to 37 percent in 2018.
  Our policies have made things worse.
  I have always believed that that expression in the Bible, to those 
who are given much, much is expected, that used to be what the Greatest 
Generation and their CEOs believed; great companies like Motorola, 
General Motors, and Ford.
  In those days, as Ford said when they founded the Model T, he wanted 
his workers to be able to afford his car. That was the magic of an 
America that was a free market/mixed-market economy that benefited 
everybody, and the wealthy lived, appropriately, very well, but not 
with obscene concentrations of wealth.
  I often think that you can't take it with you. What are you going to 
take with you? Hopefully, a guilty conscience when you realize that 
when this country needed you, what did you do? You just kept making 
more and more for yourself but not realizing how important it was for 
the rest of the country and what would happen to future generations.
  Mr. Speaker, I will close with a quote by Louis Brandeis. Lincoln 
spoke in 1841, at the beginning of what would become the Civil War. 
Brandeis was a brilliant jurist who said--and similarly when we were 
struggling with disparities of wealth and making sure every American 
felt that they were part of this, they were part of something, even if 
it was a simple thing; a Frank Capra, a simple thing, that you are part 
of something bigger than yourself. That you are a Harry Bailey being 
responsible for the homeowners who came in and borrowed money from your 
savings and loan.

[[Page H494]]

  Louis Brandeis said: ``We can have democracy in this country or we 
can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we 
can't have both.''

  It is our decision, Members of Congress, if at this moment, 
Republicans and Democrats could start looking at this and realizing, as 
I did when I was a small successful restaurant owner in the Bay area, I 
looked every day at those journals for point-of-sale retailers, and I 
realized that the working people who came into my restaurant couldn't 
go out to eat. It is one of the first things people stop when they 
can't afford extras, when they have to worry about paying their 
mortgage, or paying for their car, or getting their kids to childcare, 
if they can afford that.
  Those are the moments that we are confronting.
  Jack Kennedy said at his first inaugural speech out here on the east 
steps in his ``Ask Not'' speech--one of my favorite quotes--he said: 
Few generations get to defend freedom at its ultimate moment of threat. 
He said: I don't despair of this, I don't shrink from this, I embrace 
it.
  He said: The fight we put to this--I am paraphrasing--will bring 
light to the world.
  That is the challenge we have, whether you are a conservative 
Republican who believes in the Chicago School of thought, which I 
believe caused all these problems, trickle down doesn't work. It works 
sometimes but sometimes it doesn't work.
  We have a problem with the American economy. It is affecting our 
physical health, our life expectancy, and our mental health.
  To paraphrase Brandeis, we can have a democracy or we can have 
opportunity; opportunity that is rich for anybody.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

                      REPUBLICANS HAVE WORK TO DO

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Hageman). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Roy) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman 
talking about the state of affairs. We disagree on a number of policies 
but might actually share some sentiment.
  I, too, believe that we have significant issues we need to deal with 
right now with respect to the economy, the state of affairs for 
American families, hardworking Americans who are getting left behind, 
Americans who are not of the belief that they can actually achieve the 
American Dream. We are raising a generation--or now two--who do not 
believe they will be able to live in an America stronger than the one 
they have inherited from their parents.
  That is true. I think the question here is: What is actually the 
culprit?
  I think it is worthy to have debate about tax policy and the 
implications of taxes on corporations and families. Where do you spread 
the burden?
  My Democratic colleagues are too often mesmerized by this attack on 
trickle down and corporate tax rates, and somehow that is blowing a 
hole into the revenue of the United States Government, which is simply 
not true.
  In 2022, the United States Government brought in about 19.6 percent 
of GDP in terms of revenue to the Treasury. That represented the third 
highest mark in American history--or among the three highest marks--at 
a level seen only right after World War II and the end of the dot-com 
boom and the end of the nineties.
  Now, why do I bring that up? Because my Democratic colleagues refuse 
to acknowledge that we are, in fact, bringing in massive amounts of 
revenue.
  Now, where I might agree is maybe that revenue needs to be allocated 
slightly differently in terms of the impact on corporations or the 
wealthy or middle class. We can have those debates, but we are bringing 
in massive amounts of revenue.
  I think the question here really is: What is making it difficult for 
American families to live? I think we all agree it is really difficult 
right now for an American family to live. I know my family feels it. I 
know my friends' families feel it. They are trying to figure out how to 
live, how to afford anything: whether they can send their kids to 
school; whether they can pay for healthcare.
  I would suggest, and my Democratic colleagues would disagree, but I 
think most of my Republican colleagues would agree, the fundamental 
problem is that we have inserted the government into every aspect of 
our life.
  Literally, every stinking thing we do the government has a hand. It 
is regulating us to death, choking out every bit of entrepreneurial 
spirit, every bit of the ability to get through the day without having 
to figure out what regulation or what law, what rule you have to abide 
by.
  I can't even get in my car and figure out how to turn something on 
without figuring out some safety device. I can't fix the windshield 
without having to fix some regulatory thing that is allegedly there to 
make me safer that makes the car twice as expensive.
  We are making ourselves absolutely incapable of achieving the 
American Dream. We are doing it to ourselves. That is what is 
happening. Yet, we just keep doing it over and over again.
  This is, I think, the question of the moment: What are we going to do 
to restore the American Dream for the American people?
  We, the Representatives, here in the House of Representatives, the 
people's House, what are we going to do?
  Today wasn't the best day on the political scoreboard for 
Republicans. I am not going to lie. We spent a day, we came down here, 
we had a vote on impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas. It was a tie. We had to 
pull it down.
  Then we had to vote on Israel, which was a suspension of the rules 
that fell short of the votes necessary to move on, so we are going to 
have to address all these things again.
  But there is a bigger issue at play right now. There is something 
much more important going on. This town has been badly broken. This 
swamp that President Trump ran against has been consuming any ability 
for representation, for a government to actually serve the people.
  What we have instead is effectively a bipartisan uniparty for decades 
now that has been driven almost entirely by spending massive amounts of 
money for government programs and for foreign aid, and for, most 
importantly, the defense complex, the defense world, driven heavily by 
war.
  We have done that, and we have been messing around with tax policy.
  What else? We pass a bill here and there; we do something here and 
there.
  The fact is this whole system has been focused for entirely too long 
on spending other people's money, borrowing money, to try to buy votes 
with programs or to use the threat and the fear of war or supposedly 
our need to stand with some other country. All of that has been used as 
a political weapon every year to spend your money and spend us into 
oblivion and grow government and not do the things we say we will do 
otherwise.

                              {time}  2015

  What do I mean by all of that?
  For the bulk of this entire century, we have been at war in some form 
or fashion. Not a declared war. We have had a couple of authorizations 
of the use of military force. We haven't declared war formally, but we 
have nevertheless been effectively at war for the bulk of the 21st 
century.
  We spent $7 trillion, $8 trillion. We lost almost 10,000 Americans. 
We have had 75,000, 80,000 injuries. That is not talking about post-
traumatic stress. That is not talking about the hundreds of billions of 
dollars we just set aside for burn pits. We have ongoing conflict right 
now.
  We just had the President of the United States engaging in Syria and 
Iraq because we have troops in Syria and Iraq getting fired upon, and 
nobody in America knows why. Shouldn't this body speak to that? 
Shouldn't this body do something about that?
  We are sitting back watching the President of the United States using 
powers under the Constitution to carry out defense of our men and women 
in uniform, which everybody in this Chamber with half a brain and heart 
wants to see us defend our men and women in uniform, but we are doing 
it because they are over there in a constant perpetuation of whatever 
this body did 20 years ago to sign an authorization of the use of 
military force for things that don't even exist now.

[[Page H495]]

  Saddam Hussein is dead. What the hell are we doing? When is this body 
going to actually stand up and decide what we are going to actually do 
and mean it?
  Right now, today, we had to vote on whether or not we are going to 
fund Israel. I am a Christian. Israel is at the epicenter of my faith 
and the epicenter of most people in this world's faith. I have Jewish 
friends who are absolutely devastated about what happened in Israel on 
October 7. Of course we must and should stand alongside Israel, because 
the attack against them isn't just an attack against Israel, not just 
an attack against our ally. It is an attack against our way of life in 
western civilization, nothing less. Of course we should stand by 
Israel.
  I voted to fund Israel in November, $14.3 billion. Today I voted 
``no.'' I did not want to vote ``no'' with respect to a vote about 
standing alongside our brothers and sisters in Israel, but the people I 
represent at home, the American family trying to get by, are sick and 
tired of this town continuing to do the same thing over and over again. 
Pick a conflict, fund it; pick another conflict, fund it. Send our men 
and women in uniform overseas, fund it, with money we don't have.
  We are not passing war bonds. We are not limiting sugar. We are just 
rolling around acting like nothing is actually happening, while we have 
$34.2 trillion of debt, and it is adding up something like $80,000 a 
second. What are we doing?
  We should pay for that. Now it is not $14 billion but $17.6 billion. 
We have loads of slush funds around this town just sitting there, we 
could go grab and pay for it. Our Democratic colleagues refuse to do 
it. Republican colleagues tried to do it. Now we are walking away from 
that. I disagree. I disagree with walking away from that just so we can 
try to send a political message over to the Senate and embarrass 
Schumer and embarrass Biden. I think we should actually mean it when we 
say we should pay for supplemental spending. I don't just mean it for 
Israel. I mean it for Ukraine.
  Senate Democrats, with a handful of Republicans, tried to just jam 
the American people with a $118 billion monstrosity that would fund 
Ukraine $60 billion; fund Taiwan; fund Israel at $17.6 billion; and 
fund, allegedly, border security to the tune of $20 billion. That bill 
is falling apart in the Senate because it doesn't actually secure the 
border.
  Most Americans are sick and damn tired of getting sold a bill of 
goods, a bill that wouldn't secure the border that costs them $120 
billion that is not paid for.
  God bless, I am not afraid to criticize my friends on this side of 
the aisle. Republicans united, at least here, to tell the American 
people the truth about the bill they are trying to jam through in the 
Senate, and it looks like it is dead.
  Going back to my original point, this town operates on autopilot, 
spending money to fund wars, spending money to fund government, to fund 
programs, and if you dare challenge that, the establishment bites back. 
That is what was happening in the Senate. That is what was happening 
with Mitch McConnell. That is what is happening with the cadre of 
people in this town who desperately want that $60 billion funding for 
Ukraine. It is not about the border.
  They head pat people and say: We will give you some crumbs on the 
border; give us our $60 billion for Ukraine. We will go out, thump our 
chest, put a blue and yellow flag pin on our lapel, say we love people, 
and then we are going to go out and keep the war machine going. That is 
the truth.
  Let's be very clear. I love Israel. If you talk to Israelis, they 
will tell you a part of our annual $4 billion that we send to Israel is 
a part of the same operation. That $4 billion, we will spend that 
money, it will come back over here to defense contractors to keep doing 
what they do.
  Are they getting the right planes? Are they getting the right 
supplies? Is it the right cost? Is Israel able to defend itself without 
the United States, or is that $4 billion annual MOU, which I support--
maybe that is counterproductive. Maybe we want Israel to be standalone 
over there. When are we going to do something different? When are we 
going to peel all of this back?
  I would posit, to great credit to my Republican colleagues right now, 
we are wrestling with changing this town. That is why it is messy.
  I am not afraid to criticize colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
including my Republican colleagues, like I said. Right now, I am 
actually proud of a Republican Conference that is struggling to try to 
find a way to stop an out-of-control executive branch led by President 
Biden and my Democratic colleagues, trying to save this country, trying 
to step up and protect American families, trying to secure the border 
of the United States, trying to find a way to limit spending, trying to 
find a way to stand with Israel, but to do it responsibly.

  At every damn turn, my Democratic colleagues are trying to thwart us, 
because they are more interested in political posturing than figuring 
out how to stand up for the hardworking men and women of this country. 
They are more interested in advancing a radical leftist agenda that is 
advancing their crazy climate agenda, advancing wide open borders, 
advancing open streets where criminals are running lawless, judges in 
place that won't prosecute criminals, cops that are getting persecuted, 
walking away from Israel, and undermining Israel's sovereignty.
  That is the face of the Democratic Party: open borders, dangerous 
streets, undermining the American family, forced transgender surgeries, 
girls in boy bathrooms, boys swimming against girls in swim meets. It 
is a radical leftist Democratic Party trying to destroy the America we 
know, western civilization, and our way of life on a daily basis.
  Republicans are trying to stand to thwart that, with a bare minimum 
majority, and it is messy. That part is okay.
  The question here is what are we doing now as Republicans? We cannot 
lose sight of the unity we have as Republicans that there is a way to 
secure border, we know what it is, we are going to stand up for it, and 
we are going to fight for it. We are going to keep fighting for it now. 
We are going to fight for it in this Congress. We are going to fight 
for it through the elections. We are going to fight for it next year 
when, Lord willing, there will be a Republican President.
  No, we are not just going to pass the buck and say that any President 
can walk in and secure the border. I saw former President Trump make an 
allegation earlier today on one of his social media posts that all a 
President has to do is declare the border is closed and it is closed. 
With all due respect, that didn't happen in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. 
There were millions of people who came into the United States during 
those 4 years.
  What did happen was that that administration, led by the President, 
led by people who believe in America, led by strong leaders at DHS, 
worked to secure the border. They worked to get those numbers down, and 
they worked to force Mexico to hold people in place with the migrant 
protection protocols.
  Now, we have got a job here as Republicans. Are we going to stand up 
and pass legislation to force this administration to do its job and to 
set the stage for a future administration to do its job?
  There are loopholes in the law. I have many Republicans colleagues 
who will go out and say it is fine; we will just let the President do 
it. No. We have many things we need to fix in the law: asylum reform, 
parole reform, catch and release.
  Our job is to stand up and fight and not walk away from what we have 
accomplished. This whole debate has been on our side of the field, 
which is border security. We are not talking about amnesty. We are not 
talking about wild-eyed future flowing immigration. We are talking 
about border security. That is precisely where the American people want 
us to be. That is precisely where we ought to be. We just need to 
finish the job.
  You are not going to get solutions in this town with gangs of eight 
coming out of the Senate. All of these backroom deals that get cooked 
up and dropped on a weekend always fail, every time.
  They come through the hard work of doing the process. Let's rewind 
the clock to last year for a second. People criticized the debate over 
the Speaker. We had a fight over the Speaker a little

[[Page H496]]

over a year ago, and then we started working. We started working to 
pass bills through regular order, with single subject, with 72 hours to 
review it, and with amendments in committee.
  Guess what. We passed the best border security bill that has ever 
been passed, and it was focused on border security and it would work. 
We passed the best National Defense Authorization Act, and it undid all 
of the woke nonsense that is destroying the military and refocused it 
on its mission. We passed caps to spending. Not what I wanted. But 
through Limit, Save, Grow, we set the standard, and we ended up working 
out a deal that Democrats signed onto that put caps in place.
  We passed seven appropriations bills off of this floor and sent them 
to the Senate. We passed three other appropriations bills out of 
committee and to the floor. We had two others ready to go. We moved the 
ball forward. We processed 1,100 amendments. We were doing what we 
should do and it created unity.
  That is the process we must go back to. For the last 3 months, we 
have been passing legislation through suspension of the rules, jamming 
through big bills for political points, and that is when you fail. That 
is when things fall apart.
  The eyes of the world and the eyes of the American people are now on 
this place. There is no more hiding. There is no more cooking up 
backroom deals. The deals will be exposed, and the truth will come out. 
The bills that say they secure the border but don't will be exposed, as 
the one in the Senate just was. The big spending bills, the eyes of the 
world will see.
  People are capable of making a decision. They are able to look up and 
say: You know what? I love Israel. I want Israel to wipe Hamas off the 
face of the planet, but I am not comfortable with giving them another 
$17.6 billion unpaid for, borrowed, while our border is wide open, 
exposed to terrorists coming across, while the Democrat administration, 
funded by our own body, is funding UNRWA and the United Nations, giving 
dollars that are going to the Palestinian authority and Hamas. We are 
funding the enemies of our allies, while Secretary Blinken is going to 
Israel and going around the world and undermining Netanyahu, 
undermining the domestic tranquility of Israel, purposefully.

                              {time}  2030

  All of that is going on, and we are going around saying: Oh, we must 
pass this check, we must give them money for munitions. Meanwhile, our 
own administration is slow-walking the munitions getting from America 
to Israel.
  The American people get the joke. They see what is happening, and 
that is what you are seeing unfold on the House floor, Madam Speaker. 
People don't know what to do. The normal machinery in this place was 
designed to move large bills driven heavily by lobbyists, driven mainly 
by defense spending and some negotiation of defense versus nondefense 
in order to get a massive, bloated bill that would buy votes in 
November. That has been the MO of the United States House for as long 
as I can remember.
  The gig is up. The American people are on to it. The American people 
are getting tired of being taken for a ride. They want us to actually 
do what we said we would do. They want us to actually secure the 
border. They want us to actually cut spending. Yes, they want us to 
stand with Israel, but they don't want us to write blank checks. This 
is not that hard.
  Our colleagues in the Senate want to jam us here in the House. 
Democrat colleagues and some Republican colleagues in the Senate want 
to send over now with their border effort--not to secure the border but 
border political effort--very specifically designed as cover for our 
Democratic colleagues to have some reason to be able to run in November 
and say that it is Republicans' fault that the borders are wide open 
and not President Biden's.
  Our Senate colleagues want to send to us now a Ukraine package with 
Israel. So for all of the viewers at home, what is happening is that we 
are responding by saying: Well, we are going to jump in front of that 
by sending a clean Israel bill, so we can separate Ukraine.
  None of this is the regular order that the American people would 
expect. Put a bill on the floor, offer amendments, and let it rise or 
fall. Put Israel on the floor, put an amendment that would pay for it, 
and see what happens. Put an amendment on it that would cut UNRWA 
funding because why are we funding Israel while we are also funding 
their enemies?
  Why don't we just put that on the floor with amendments and see what 
happens?
  How about FISA?
  Do all you Americans out there love being spied on?
  Let's put FISA on the floor, let's put four or five amendments on it, 
and see what happens.
  See if the American people want us to have warrants when people's 
information is being looked at.
  Put the bills on the floor.
  Ukraine, put the bill on the floor. Make a decision: yes or no, up or 
down.
  Are we going to fund it?
  Where are we getting $60 billion?
  Are we just going to print it?
  Do you want to know why your inflation is up, Madam Speaker?
  Put it on the floor. Have a vote.
  Madam Speaker, $60 billion. What is the mission?
  What are we going to get out of it?
  What are the limits?
  Are the oligarchs getting it?
  Are we paying for pensions?
  Is it lethal aid?
  Are we expecting to get Crimea and Donbas back, or are we expecting 
just to have a sovereign nation and Russians to be pushed back out?
  Is that our call?
  Do the American people want to spend their treasure?
  Seriously. This is the question, and yet today we did it with Israel.
  Why?
  It is because we love Israel. Israel holds a special place in our 
heart. They are our friends and our allies, but, importantly, we all 
get the truth, it is our faith. We don't want to see Israel attacked.
  Many of my colleagues have a Biblical belief that they have to stand 
by Israel. I do, too. I think it is important, but if we don't have 
rules, then we lose our own country. There will be no America to stand 
with Israel if we don't have sovereignty and we have open borders and 
terrorists coming in who are undermining our security.
  There will be no America to stand with Israel if we are bankrupt and 
$34 trillion in debt and we are spending money we don't have even if it 
is for Israel. There have to be some rules. There have to be.
  We go home, and we campaign we are going to cut spending, but we 
don't do it. We are going to vote in 3 weeks allegedly on omnibus or 
minibus spending bills. What that means is a big package of bills all 
brought over from the Senate with maybe some policy changes for the 
next 6 months, I doubt much, that spends $30 billion more than Nancy 
Pelosi's bloated spending levels that we all campaigned against.
  How is that changing Washington or cutting spending or draining the 
swamp or fiscal responsibility or balancing the budget?
  It is none of those things. It is none.
  Yet my colleagues will run on passing balanced budget amendments 
which will not happen. We are going to go spend $17 billion and throw 
that out there to go fund Israel because they are our friend. I agree, 
but we are going to do that unpaid for.
  So we just racked up another $17 billion on top of the $13 billion we 
appropriated last November for hurricanes and emergency relief, and now 
they ask for $60 billion for Ukraine.
  When is that madness going to stop?
  Meanwhile, my people in Texas are saying: When is the border going to 
get secure?
  They want to know when the fentanyl is going to stop pouring into 
their communities and when migrants are not going to be walking through 
the streets grabbing people. An MS-13 gang member is grabbing young 
women and dragging them out of bathrooms. They killed a young woman, 
and a mom is saying: Where are you, America?
  Do we not have a duty to defend this country?
  Nevertheless, we are not going to do that.
  We are going to vote to fund the government in 3 weeks that leaves 
this country exposed to criminals, to terrorists, to cartels, and to 
fentanyl. We are going to do it, Madam Speaker, you

[[Page H497]]

watch. A bipartisan, uniparty bill will get voted off of this floor 
that does not a damn thing to fundamentally alter what is happening at 
the border while Texas takes it on the chin.
  Why should Texans pay their Federal taxes? Why?
  Why should Texans give a rip about what we do in this body when it is 
all against them? It is all against us as Texans?
  For that matter, why should anybody pay taxes?
  The rule of law matters if you want people to follow it. If we are 
printing money, destroying the dollar, and destroying the economy and 
bloating the government in hiring and funding bureaucrats to undermine 
your liberty to pass regulations to take away your happiness and 
undermine your ability to prosper, you are printing money and borrowing 
money to do that, what is the point of paying your taxes?
  It hurts to write that check. It hurts to lose that money to go to 
the Federal Government, but if the Federal Government is just going to 
spend money anyway, why do Americans believe that they have a duty to 
go pay their taxes?
  So we pay $2 trillion in taxes but borrow $2 trillion or pay $4 
trillion in taxes but borrow $4 trillion?
  That is crazy. I have got some colleagues who are waiting to come out 
on the floor, so I am going to in a few minutes yield.
  Madam Speaker, here is the thing. This country is not done yet, but 
it is getting damn close. That is where we are. We cannot be a free and 
secure country if we are $34 trillion in debt and bleeding $2 trillion 
a year.
  We cannot be a free, secure, and sovereign nation if our borders are 
wide open, terrorists are coming in, cartels are coming in, and 
fentanyl is pouring in.
  We cannot be a free, secure, and sovereign nation if we are printing 
money to fund foreign conflicts that we don't have an actual vested 
interest in or if we do we are not acting like it, when we never 
declared war and we never really specifically authorized the force and 
we continue to fund it so that the machine in this godforsaken town can 
keep making money.
  Why are the seven wealthiest counties in America right here?
  We are printing money and funding it.
  Three-quarters of the cars I drive by in this town are a hell of a 
lot nicer than any of the cars that I have got or that any of the 
hardworking people whom I represent have because we are printing money 
and funding this place to stick it to the American people every single 
day.
  This is what the American people are on to. They are sick of the same 
game. They are sick of bills that come to this floor and are designed 
for a political purpose rather than to achieve an end that is 
constitutional, that is paid for, and that is responsible.
  I was spending a lot of time in the last month out on the campaign 
trail, and my friend, the Governor of Florida, Governor DeSantis, would 
talk about his time in service in the United States Navy, but, more 
importantly, he would talk about when flying into Ronald Reagan 
National Airport looking out of the left side of the plane and seeing 
the Washington Monument, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln 
Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, and the White House, and all of these 
monuments to our ideals, who we are as a people, the inspiring white 
buildings. Nevertheless, then he would point out that if you look out 
of the right side of the plane, Madam Speaker, when you are coming in 
that northern route down the Potomac River, you see a whole bunch of 
other monuments, evenly distributed, small, and all identical of the 
400,000 men and women who are buried there having fought under that 
flag, the American flag, the 13 stripes and the 50 stars.
  When we come here on this floor, all 400,000 of them, all of the 
hundreds of thousands buried around this country, all of those who have 
given the last full measure of devotion for something bigger than 
themselves, we carry that burden. We have to actually do the hard work 
of representation.
  That does not mean flying here on Monday for a fly-in vote, having a 
dinner with some meaningless votes, getting up on Tuesday and Wednesday 
to do a series of preprogrammed votes for political purposes, and then 
flying out Thursday to go do a damn fundraiser back home.
  That is what we do.
  We have a responsibility to actually finish the work that those 
400,000 started, that George Washington called ``the sacred fire of 
liberty.''
  Liberty depends on us, though, and we are not going to be free if we 
are mortgaging our future.
  We are not going to be free if we come down here and we are forced to 
choose to stand by our friend Israel or print more money.
  That was the choice I was given. That is not a choice. That is not a 
choice we have to make; we choose to make it. We choose to take the 
easy path. We choose to fail to do our job and to actually follow some 
rules that will keep us somewhere close to the straight and narrow of 
caring for the legacy of those who came before us.

                              {time}  2045

  The hardworking American family out there today, right now struggling 
to get by, is looking to us to fix it.
  It is not acceptable for a migrant to come into this country 
illegally, beat a cop in New York, get sent out on no bail, flick off 
the American people. That will destroy our country more than anything 
else.
  That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable, and we have to end it, 
or we won't have a country left.
  We have to stop spending money we don't have. We have to. It is not 
hyperbole. You can't make a good decision here about balancing 
interests if you just write blank checks. You can't do it.
  One of my strong Jewish friends out in conservative radio was 
pointing out we are $34 trillion in debt--hell, $300 trillion in debt 
if you look at the entire Fed's balance sheet and everything that we 
have going on. What is $17 billion? That is exactly right, except I 
have to say it is exactly wrong, or we will never change this place.
  I came here and said I wouldn't vote for unpaid-for supplemental 
spending, and even if my best friend is out there getting hurt, I have 
to find a way to do it the right way, or we are going to lose this 
country. Then, as I said, there will be no America left to stand with 
Israel. There will be no America left for some people to go to, no 
America left for migrants to seek to come to, to live a better life 
because the rule of law will be gone. The fiscal health of our country 
will be gone. The American Dream will be unattainable.
  I think we can choose a different path, and I think Republicans are 
actually in the process of choosing a different path right now by 
challenging the status quo of this town that our Democratic colleagues 
want to continue to exploit to grow government and to regulate and to 
have open borders and to have our streets wide open. Republicans are 
standing athwart that, and right now is the opportunity for Republicans 
to make good on what we have been saying for my entire life. That is 
that the American Dream depends on what we do here to ensure that the 
Federal Government is not meddling in the lives of the American people, 
undermining their ability to prosper, undermining the American economy, 
making us less secure, empowering our enemies, emboldening those who 
want to do us harm, undermining Western civilization.
  We can stop that. We can, in fact, as William Buckley said, stand 
athwart history yelling stop. The progressive movement that is designed 
to undermine our very way of life needs to end right now, and it ends 
by Republicans standing up on the wall and saying no.
  That is our calling. That is what we need to do. If we do that and if 
we unite, then we will actually have the majority that we tend to try 
to buy with single votes on the House floor when, instead, you earn 
them by doing what we are supposed to do under the Constitution.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                        HONORING FRED ZEILBERGER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito) is 
recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the 
majority leader.
  Mr. D'ESPOSITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible 
man

[[Page H498]]

and Fourth District neighbor, Fred Zeilberger.
  Mr. Zeilberger is a Holocaust survivor, Korean war veteran, dedicated 
husband, proud father, and an American whose life is a testament to the 
power of perseverance.
  Born in 1929 in Wurzburg, Germany, Fred faced extreme hardship at the 
hands of Nazi forces, who forced him into a camp in Latvia and later 
the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, where he was eventually 
liberated.
  While Fred survived, the evil Nazi war machine murdered his mother 
and sister. Fred's father also died shortly after being liberated from 
the Buchenwald concentration camp.
  After surviving the horrors of World War II, Fred emigrated to the 
United States of America in 1947 in search of new opportunities. A few 
years later, in 1951, Fred donned the uniform of his adopted country 
after being drafted into the United States Army during the Korean war, 
where he served as a butcher.
  Fred's tenure in the Army was followed by a lengthy career in the 
wholesale meat industry, where he established his own business in 1956. 
This proud businessowner chose to make his home in Cedarhurst, 
alongside his wife, Elaine, and three children, Jenna, Rachel, and 
Zane.
  Fred has long been an important part of the village of Cedarhurst 
community and locales far beyond. His ongoing service as a Holocaust 
educator provides younger generations an important witness to the 
atrocities that occurred during that dark time in human history.
  I am immensely grateful for Fred's life of service, the sacrifices he 
made in defense of this Nation, and his lifelong commitment to never 
forgetting the Shoa.
  In that vein, I was happy to see Fred recognized during this year's 
Holocaust Remembrance Day service in Nassau County by County Executive 
Bruce Blakeman, where attendees were able to learn of his story and 
struggle.
  Fred Zeilberger has culturally enriched the communities that comprise 
New York's Fourth Congressional District, and I am grateful to call him 
a Nassau County neighbor.
  I thank Mr. Zeilberger for his work and his dedication to the truth, 
to his family, to history, and to this country.


                         Honoring Bob Beckwith

  Mr. D'ESPOSITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today on a sad occasion to 
honor the life of a dedicated family man, committed first responder, 
and proud American who passed away this past Sunday, Bob Beckwith, of 
Baldwin, New York, a resident of the Fourth Congressional District.
  Bob Beckwith had a storied career serving the people of New York City 
as an FDNY firefighter. Bob joined the FDNY in 1965 and was assigned to 
Ladder 117 in Astoria, Queens, before transferring to Ladder 164 in 
Douglaston, where he served until his retirement in 1994.
  During Bob's 29-year tenure in the FDNY, he faithfully protected the 
people of the city of New York, but in the aftermath of the September 
11 attacks, Bob became more than just a hero for New York. He became a 
national symbol of American resilience.
  Even though Bob was retired, he made his way to Ground Zero after the 
attacks to help search for survivors. While there, he stood shoulder to 
shoulder with President George Bush when the President delivered his 
famous ``I can hear you'' speech that rallied a Nation in mourning.
  You see, Bob handed over a megaphone so that the people at Ground 
Zero could hear the President, but little did he know that that 
megaphone would allow the people across the world to hear the President 
that day.
  His presence alongside President Bush demonstrated that, even in one 
of this country's darkest hours, there were still brave Americans 
giving it their all to rescue neighbors. The image of Bob standing atop 
the wreckage of Engine 76 will forever be etched into our Nation's 
history.
  The Nation heard President Bush's rousing speech on that day in 2001, 
but everyone watching also witnessed Bob Beckwith's quiet courage.
  While Bob left us last weekend, I know his spirit will live on in the 
lives of his 6 children, 10 grandchildren, 2 great-grandchildren, the 
heroes of the FDNY, and every American who loves this country as much 
as Bob Beckwith did.
  Rest in peace to a Fourth Congressional District neighbor, a dear 
friend, an American hero, Bob Beckwith.
  My thoughts are with his widow, Barbara, and the entire Beckwith 
family during this difficult time.
  Mr. Beckwith, a final tip of the helmet to you.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                         SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
Schweikert) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, last week, I promised we were getting 
close to actually finishing our math in regard to what was the true 
story of what was happening with Social Security. A couple of our Ph.D. 
economists have spent months, and we have put it together.
  However, I first want to talk a little bit about the politics of 
telling the truth around this place. Then I want to talk about the 
reality that the Democrats, our brothers and sisters on the left, 
either willfully or through ignorance, their solution just doesn't get 
you there, and the immorality.
  Let's first walk through something. How many of you have heard over 
and over from me behind this microphone that, in 2033, 2034, a 25 
percent cut, because the Social Security trust fund is emptied? I had a 
debate the other day with a Democratic Member here who is running for 
another office, and she was saying Social Security doesn't contribute 
at all to the debt and deficit.
  She is absolutely right. That is not what we are discussing. What we 
are discussing is, in 8 or 9 years, we are going to double senior 
poverty, the average couple in America. In 2033--I am going to use 2034 
because at least that is more of a consensus number for the exhaustion 
of the trust fund. That average couple in America will take a $17,400 
cut. Articles that we have been collecting on the number of baby 
boomers who are ending up homeless--they are ending up on the street. 
We are looking at numbers that would explode that type of dystopian 
vision. Yet, if you get behind this microphone and tell the truth about 
the math, right now, some troll in a basement is writing something 
saying: Schweikert mentioned Social Security. Let's attack.
  It is the same thing with Medicare. This society is absolutely 
immoral. We have this obligation to modernize, to save, to protect. If 
you step up to try to do it, you will be attacked. There is a reason we 
call it the third rail.
  Well, screw them. We are going to tell the truth here. Part of the 
morality here is: How do you save something? How do you modernize it? 
How do you protect seniors?
  Everyone runs away from the discussion, runs away from the actuarial 
reports, because the moment you start to tell the truth, you are a 
target. Now, most of it is not true. I had someone in my office a 
couple of hours ago bring me something saying: Look, this person is 
writing editorials in your district saying you voted against Social 
Security.

  I am going, okay, let's see. I actually used to chair the 
subcommittee over Social Security, trying to work out the math and 
those things to save it. I don't remember ever having a vote in this 
place to change it.
  We looked it up. There hasn't been, but this is the way politics 
works anymore. Make crap up. Then you wonder why it is toxic. It is so 
much easier around here to pretend, somehow pretend magic is going to 
fall out of the sky and everything is going to be fine.
  Let's actually walk through a couple of things here. One of the 
things, just because this bothers me, my sarcasm that this is a math-
free zone, I listened to a number of people, both Republicans and 
Democrats, get behind these microphones today, and they have no 
understanding of the scale of the problem.
  Therefore, let's actually do a little bit of very simple math off the 
top of our heads so you understand some of the scale. Yesterday, 
interest rates popped up a bit. They came down a bit today, but I 
think, at one point yesterday, they were up 14 basis points. I just

[[Page H499]]

need this to be an example. The math is not going to be perfect. One 
percent on $34.2 trillion would be $342 billion of interest, right?

                              {time}  2100

  And a basis point is 1/100, so 1 basis point would be $3.4 billion, 
right?
  Just agree with me.
  So the 14 basis points movement in interest rates yesterday on 10-
year sovereigns, if that had stuck throughout this year, that is $48 
billion.
  Understand we are here knifing ourselves over fractions and fractions 
of a day's interest. We borrow about $7.5 billion a day. We borrow 
$85,000 a second, but here is the scam: We will knife each other back 
and forth over math--these are real numbers. This is important, but we 
are doing everything we can to avoid explaining the scale when a single 
day's interest rate movement is almost $50 billion.
  Then you hear Members come behind the microphone, it was $6 billion. 
Well, that was less than a day's worth of borrowing interest. I don't 
mean the total borrowing.
  I know I have been exacerbated, but I am frustrated because there is 
this unwillingness to understand the scale of the problem.
  Let's actually start to walk through the charts and try to get this. 
I have a mistake on this chart and I owe everyone an apology. Our math 
right now is, we are heading towards borrowing between about $2.7 to 
over $3 trillion this year.
  Remember, it was only several months ago, CBO and OMB and all those 
were saying, it is only going to be like a $1.6 trillion borrow. 
Something is horribly wrong. We have doubled it, but we have doubled it 
at a time when the economy is actually doing fairly well.
  Understand what these higher interest rates mean. Understand what the 
growth in healthcare costs mean.
  Right now this was our projection. We are going to borrow $1.45 
trillion. That is our Social Security. That is coming out of the trust 
fund and out of the taxes you are paying every single day.
  The next line item is where we had a mistake. We were saying gross 
interest was going to go over $1 trillion, making interest the second 
most expensive thing in this government. We also came back and showed 
that net interest was still the second most expensive.
  The difference between net and gross is gross is the interest we pay 
back to trust funds for borrowing the money. Net is only publicly held. 
The rest of the world doesn't make that distinction. It is just one of 
the things we do in the United States. That is why if you ever see 
something from OECD, they have the United States at like 144 percent of 
debt-to-GDP. It is because they put back in the borrowing from trust 
funds.
  It turns out Treasury a few hours ago did one of their monthly 
updates, and I have to apologize to everyone that gross interest for 
the year wasn't $1.003 trillion. I got it wrong. It turns out it is 
going to be $1.67 trillion, and we think this number is off because we 
had been looking at the Treasury receipts, the growth of spending, 
growth of healthcare, growth of interest. My math now is just interest. 
Just interest this year will be $1.100 trillion. No one knows what 12 
zeros are.
  When I speak about a trillion dollars with my brothers and sisters, 
Members of Congress, our staff, they just sort of stare at you. What 
you need to understand is, this is a disaster. It is an absolute 
disaster. Trillion, thousand, billion, but yet we are going to sit here 
and knife each other for months and months and months over a fraction 
of a fraction of a fraction of this because we don't want to actually 
deal with the actual structural crisis.
  We got old. The fact of the matter is, it is uncomfortable to talk 
about, but unless we do some things revolutionary on the cost of 
healthcare and dramatically change government, it doesn't work.
  Basic math: Every dime of defense is now borrowed. Every dime of 
discretionary now is borrowed and if you start to look at this math, it 
is about $1.4 trillion of Medicare, the stuff we don't even get to vote 
on.
  Every dime a Member of Congress votes on is now borrowed. We are 
clicking off another trillion dollars of borrowing every 140 days. And 
if you think you are going to fix that by a rounding error on this 
little piece of discretionary or this little piece here, it is a game 
of avoidance.
  I have had Members here who will, when I start to talk about a 
deficit commission where we are going to have to do a major redesign, 
they say, oh, David, I can't vote for that. I will, however, fight like 
hell to save a few hundred million here and there. That is real money.
  We are borrowing $85,000 a second, $7.4 billion a day, but it is 
great theater for our voters. It is horrible math, but great theater.
  So understand, even the Treasury statement now confirms my math. We 
are borrowing over a trillion dollars in interest. That is just the 
interest borrowing. And total borrowing looks like it may be coming in 
closer to $2.7 to $3 trillion this year.
  Let's do a quick walk through before we get to the stuff where I soak 
myself in kerosene and light myself on fire.
  What happened between the 2022 fiscal year and 2023 fiscal year? 
Well, first off, if we actually take a look, Social Security spending--
but it comes out of the trust fund, comes out of tax receipts--was up 
11.1 percent in a single year.
  Between fiscal year 2022 and 2023, if you take a look at the spending 
on Medicare, not Medicaid, not Indian Health Services, not veterans, 
just Medicare, spending was up 12.3; interest was up 38.7 percent.
  Anyone see a trend here?
  We are trying to track these same sort of numbers for this fiscal 
year. Maybe no one really cares. I know these numbers are really big. 
It is easier to scream and yell and worry about a shiny object or some 
latest conspiracy theory. You don't need a conspiracy theory. Just look 
at the math.
  Let's actually have an honest conversation of how much trouble Social 
Security is in and why it is absolutely moral that we keep our 
promises. We actually tell the truth about how we are going to 
modernize it, here is how we are going to save it, here is what we have 
to do to fix it. The reality of it is it has to be done with our 
Democratic colleagues.

  They have got to stop using it as a tool to win elections. And what 
is fascinating in the polling, I think FreedomWorks did some polling 
recently, saying if you are under 45, under 50, you understand this 
math.
  If you are over, you don't. You are almost pretending it doesn't 
exist. What happens to you? Think about yourselves. What happens to you 
if it is 8 years, 9 years from now and you get a nice letter from 
Social Security saying we are cutting your check by 25 percent?
  I am going to show a chart here, but remember my words: The average 
will be a $17,400 cut in 2033 or 2034, depending on if you use CBO's 
number or Social Security's actuaries.
  One of our structural problems is, in 1960, we had 5.1 workers. In 
2035, we were saying 2.3. We have been told this number is wrong. It is 
actually less, but we are trying to vet that number.
  Remember, Social Security was designed as a pay-as-you-go system. If 
you pay attention to some of these presentations--I have come here a 
dozen times and shown the average couple gets every dime back they put 
into Social Security plus about 72,000 SPIF.

                              {time}  2110

  It is a horrible rate of return, but you do get your money back plus 
a little bit of a SPIF, but it is a horrible rate of return. I want all 
of you to remember as we talk about this potential misery that 20 years 
ago, when Republicans got up and said, if we could just take a little 
sliver and do some other things with it, when we got to the 2030s, we 
would have a system that is actually more robust and people would have 
a much higher rate of return. It turns out they told the truth.
  When those activists told you, oh, they are trying to steal your 
money, this and that, try to remember this. They lied to you, and we 
now have 20 years of data to prove it.
  However, the big lie around here continues because it is great 
politics. Scare the crap out of people, and then make sure they don't 
actually read an actuary report because that might require math, and 
this is a math-free zone.

[[Page H500]]

  Let's actually walk through this. We are going to use 2034 because 
that is the one date we absolutely can vet, even though CBO says 2033. 
They both agree on a 25, 25.2 percent cut in benefits. In 2034, our 
best math is that very first year, single year number, $616 billion 
shortfall. That just means the trust fund is emptied, and without the 
trust fund to back up, the payroll tax that is coming in and the offset 
to beneficiaries, if there is more beneficiary checks, oh, oh, we have 
got a $616 billion shortfall. That is where you get your 25 percent 
cut.
  You start to understand, for lower-income workers who are receiving 
Social Security, as a couple, that is a $10,600 cut. For the average, 
it is that $17,400 I was talking about. For high-income couples, it is 
over $23,000. Remember, there is actually a formula within Social 
Security where lower-income workers with their 40 quarters get a little 
bit more than higher-income workers. It is part of the formula.
  Here is the math. It is conservative math. We worked like hell--well, 
the Joint Economic economists worked like hell on this. My job was just 
to torment them. In 2034, if you do the Democrats' and the President's 
solution of saying, hey, just take people over $400,000 and make them 
pay the 12.4 percent. Okay. Right now I think this year it is 168 
something is subject to Social Security tax, and you have this, like, 
doughnut hole in this plan. For everyone else in today's world, you hit 
that 168, if you are above that, you are not paying the Social Security 
tax anymore.
  On this math, understand this, this is sort of the Democrats', the 
President's plan, we are just going to tax people who make $400,000 and 
up, make them pay the 12.4 percent, but we are not going to give them 
any benefits for it.
  Okay, fine. It doesn't get you close. This is your new revenue. Our 
best model is you might get about $259 billion of income into Social 
Security doing it that way, but you slow down the economy. That would 
be general tax revenues.
  Over here is your still-remaining shortfall. You still have, what is 
that, $417 billion shortfall in that single year. You have already done 
the Democrat plan, and you still have a $417 billion shortfall. The 
next time you see an AARP attack ad on someone because they were 
willing to try to talk about saving Social Security, I hope they tell 
you the truth and say, our plan, we have supported raising this tax, 
but it looks like it doesn't even cover half. As a matter of fact, it 
only covers like 30, 40 percent of the shortfall.
  Let's actually go to the next level. I did this chart to just 
basically reemphasize what is going on in the math. The shortfall, tax 
receipts, tax receipts with the higher tax, tax receipts without it 
because it also actually has an effect on the general fund. The general 
fund, tax receipts go down.
  Now let's go to the other proposal. Let's not do people $400,000 and 
up. Let's do everyone $250,000 and up. Remember, this is 8, 9 years 
from now, okay? Remember, we should be working--it is not like we are 
doing anything useful here--on the 2025 fiscal year budget. Now we are 
talking about the 2033, 2034 fiscal budgets.
  Well, if you take everyone that makes $250,000 and up, and you 
subject them to the 12.4 percent, okay, fine, you get, our best model, 
about $380 billion of taxes, leaving $237 billion short, and you have 
slowed down tax receipts by $88 billion, so you are going to have a 
$325 billion shortfall.
  Okay. Well, that is not good enough. Let's just get rid of the caps 
all together. If you were making 168 today, it doesn't matter there is 
no 168, everyone pays the 12.4 percent. You still have pretty much the 
exact same shortfall because that gap doesn't produce that much tax 
receipts between no cap and the $250,000 cap.
  Still, the model is almost identical. You slow down tax receipts by 
$88 billion. The shortfall is $234 billion, so you are basically back 
to, what, $324 billion? No, $322 billion.

  The reason I do this is not to end my political career, but to tell 
the truth. Is it moral to be basically--it is right in front of us. It 
is coming. We know it is coming. There are actuary reports from Social 
Security, from CBO, from private groups, those around us, then there is 
the political ones who just lie to you because they want you to send 
them a contribution or they want Democrats to win the next election, 
which I believe those groups are absolutely immoral. I believe what the 
Democrats have been doing is absolutely immoral, but damn it, they care 
about winning the next election a hell of a lot more than they care 
about doubling senior poverty or the number of baby boomers who are 
expected to be homeless in a decade.
  Somehow when they say, oh, we will just take care of the shortfall, 
we will just get rid of the cap on rich people, it doesn't get you 
where you have got to go. Is there any leadership around here other 
than me as an idiot getting behind this microphone and telling people 
the truth?
  I have done presentations on also what is happening on Medicare. 
Guess what? It is multiples of the problem of this one. The difference 
here is we have a specific trust fund, so we can see the date it 
expires.
  I beg of you, if you are a voter out there, don't let some politician 
squirm out of, well, if we just tax rich people more, we would have 
plenty of money. That is not true. Look, I don't have all the answers, 
but I bet you I can make this work. It would be painful, but I bet you 
I can find a way to not let the collapse happen. Demand the morality 
that this government is going to keep its promises.
  This chart here is now 2 years old. The top line here is not $116 
trillion of debt. Now it is assumed to be closer to $130 trillion of 
debt over the next 30 years. Every dime of debt between today and 30 
years--and I don't know if the mics are picking the sound up, but my 19 
month old is in the back in the screaming. Yes, I have a 19 month old. 
That is a different discussion. Does that child deserve to have the 
same life the rest of us have had?
  Here is the math. 100 percent of the borrowing, it is coming. 
Interest. The shortfall of Medicare, because remember the vast majority 
of Medicare spending comes straight out of the general fund, and the 
Medicare trust fund is scheduled to be empty in, what, 7 years, okay? 
Part A trust fund is really primarily just hospital coverage.
  This is if we actually say we are not going to fix the Social 
Security trust fund, we are just going to borrow the money, we are just 
going to borrow the money. If you update what that means, it is about 
$130 trillion of borrowing. The crazy thing is the CBO math is actually 
the rest of government, military, discretionary, which military is 
discretionary, but all nondefense discretionary actually over the 30 
years when adjusted for inflation actually falls. That little portion 
actually has like a $3 trillion positive. The rest of it is about $130 
trillion negative.

                              {time}  2120

  Who is going to tell you that? It is all over. I mean, if anyone 
actually reads the reports, it is there. That is uncomfortable.
  We will spend maybe this next year doing really important stuff with 
failed legislation, failed votes. Every single day, we are going to 
click off another $7 billion, $7\1/2\ billion of borrowing. We will 
give some beautiful speeches about how we are fighting to save this 
little tiny bit of money, but we are not going to tell you it is little 
tiny.
  I have seen fights on the floor that in the time the fight on the 
floor took, the interest clock on U.S. borrowing used up more money 
than the debate was fighting to save.
  In Washington, D.C., it is always about the money. Group after group 
is wandering the hallways this time of year, all with wonderful things 
for us to spend more money on. Many of the things are things you really 
like. They get outraged at you when you start to pull out these charts 
and say, can we talk about what is going on?
  Once again--I will do this as my closing--every dime of defense is 
borrowed, every dime of discretionary is borrowed, and now $1.4 
trillion of mandatory, things we don't even get to vote on, is now 
borrowed.
  We are going to give these beautiful speeches about trying to save 
$16 billion, which is a lot of money, except it is like 2\1/4\ days of 
borrowing.
  We fought over that sort of amount for 7 months, and in that time, we 
clicked off well over another trillion dollars of borrowing because we 
fight over the shiny little objects instead of the willingness to 
actually have an honest conversation about the structural crisis 
because this is politically

[[Page H501]]

easy. You get a nice little spot on Twitter or Facebook or on social 
media, maybe even a hit on cable television, but it is a lie.
  How do you save this place when it won't even put batteries in its 
calculator?
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we sing about the glory of Your Name. May we live lives 
that will tell our Nation and world how glorious You are. Thank You for 
Your promises, for they refresh us each day. We are grateful for Your 
promises to supply all our needs, to guard our hearts with Your peace, 
and to keep us from stumbling or slipping as we strive to walk on the 
road of integrity.
  Bless our Senators. Use them to contribute to the forces for harmony 
and goodness in our Nation and world. Give them the wisdom to make 
decisions that will glorify You. May they seek to serve rather than be 
served, following Your example of humility and sacrifice.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, Iran-backed terrorists 
carried out another deadly attack on a base that houses U.S. personnel 
in Syria. The Iran-backed Houthis continue to threaten U.S. vessels and 
international shipping in the Red Sea.
  Three days after President Biden directed strikes in response to the 
killing of three U.S. soldiers in Jordan, Iran and its proxies are 
demonstrating that their particular calculus has not changed.
  The President said on Friday that our adversaries should know that 
``if you harm an American, we will respond.'' Well, by their actions, 
our adversaries are turning the President's words back around. They are 
essentially saying: We will attack America at times and places of our 
choosing.
  Iran and the expendable terrorists it trades for American blood are 
demonstrably undeterred, and they are hardly the only ones. For 3 
years, America's adversaries have luxuriated in a world that no longer 
takes us at our word. Embarrassing retreat from Afghanistan, fawning 
climate diplomacy with our top strategic competitor, failure to take 
Putin seriously until it was too late, and fears of escalation that 
delayed lethal aid to Ukraine at every turn--for 3 years, America's 
foreign policy has been defined by hesitation, half measures, and self-
deterrence. President Biden has dug our credibility--the value of 
America's word--into a hole.
  Meanwhile, our adversaries are aligning and coordinating to an 
unprecedented degree. As America gives our allies and partners reasons 
to doubt our resolve, Russia and China are engaged in a ``friendship 
without limits.'' The contrast couldn't be starker.
  But it doesn't have to be this way. Take it from practitioners who 
know that better than anyone. For example, just yesterday, former 
National Security Advisor retired Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster had 
this to say:

       The abandonment of Kyiv would be a gift to the Moscow-
     Tehran-Beijing-Pyongyang axis of aggressors. Allies and 
     partners would lose trust in America as those aggressors are 
     emboldened. The result could be cascading

[[Page S402]]

     conflicts even more costly than the interconnected wars in 
     Ukraine and across the Middle East.

  Of course, General McMaster was the National Security Advisor to 
President Trump.
  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in the Trump administration, 
put it this way, after his recent visit to Ukraine:

       It will be far more costly and dangerous if Putin wins.

  Another former National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, also with 
the previous administration, expressed his support for supplemental 
security assistance to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine, saying simply:

       The free world has been attacked, and we're the arsenal of 
     democracy.

  It is in America's direct interest to take growing threats seriously, 
to invest even more urgently in our capabilities to meet them, and to 
support our allies and partners on the frontlines.
  The reality of hard power competition simply does not wait for the 
President or Congress to take it seriously. Either we confront 
challenges we face with clear strategic and firm resolve or we lose. 
Around the world, 21st-century autocrats and medieval theocrats will 
continue to challenge the U.S.-led order that has underpinned global 
peace and prosperity for generations, and their proxies will continue 
to target American personnel and American interests with lethal force.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, the Sun may be shining outside, but 
today is a gloomy day here in the U.S. Senate.
  Last night, Members of the other side of the aisle met to decide 
whether they were going to side with the American people or obey the 
wishes of former President Trump and his friend Vladimir Putin.
  While I was not party to that meeting, the reports that came out of 
it were disturbing, to say the least. After months of good-faith 
negotiations, after months of giving Republicans many of the things 
they asked for, Leader McConnell and the Republican conference are 
ready to kill the national security supplemental package, even with the 
border provisions they so fervently demanded.
  Those reports are disturbing because this is a good bill, a 
bipartisan bill that will address the problems at the border directly, 
expeditiously, seriously.
  And don't take my word for it, just ask the conservative editorial 
page of the Wall Street Journal that called this ``a border bill worth 
passing'' or the president of the National Border Patrol Council--who 
rarely sides with Democrats--who called this bill ``far better than the 
status quo'' or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which called this package 
``a commonsense measure'' and warned that ``Congress cannot afford to 
ignore these problems any longer.''
  So last night's reports coming from the Republican conference meeting 
are alarming because they represent a dramatic transformation in 
Republican thought. In October, Republicans objected to President 
Biden's national security supplemental request, telling the world they 
could not consider it without, in Leader McConnell's words, ``something 
credible on the border.'' He said his conference would give ``this 
supplemental request a serious look and probably recommend some changes 
as well.'' That was October 22, 2023.
  Since then, Senators on both sides of the aisle have conducted 
intense, good-faith negotiations to try and find a way forward on the 
border. We thought we were close in December, but some on the other 
side did not want to be ``jammed'' by the Christmas holiday so we gave 
them more time.
  Senator Graham reasoned that a delay was necessary and thought that 
President Biden ``should get involved in border/immigration 
negotiations.'' Well, President Biden did get involved, and he gave 
Senator Graham more time that he asked for. And yet again yesterday, he 
asked for more time once again.
  In December, Senator Fischer accused Democrats of not wanting to 
address border security, saying that ``my democratic colleagues support 
[border] security for Taiwan, they support [border] security for 
Ukraine, and they support [border] security for Israel. But what they 
won't support is basic border security for the United States of 
America. We are told that our own border security is not related to the 
national security supplemental? That's absurd.''
  That is what she said. ``That's absurd'' not to have border security 
in the bill, in December. Well, yesterday, she said she would refuse to 
even debate a bill that addressed our national security and border 
security--not even a debate.
  The entire process has been quite a roller coaster. And it is not 
just my Senate colleagues who keep moving the goalposts. In November, 
Speaker Johnson said that ``with our appropriations bills for Ukraine 
funding, for example, we're going to marry that with border security. 
These two things are going to be handled together because we believe 
it's a top priority.''
  But when former President Trump said he didn't want Republicans to 
solve the border problem, that he wanted it as a campaign issue, 
Speaker Johnson did a 180-degree about-face and obediently and 
obeisantly changed his tune.
  Now, I understand politics. I understand electoral strategy. But for 
more than a year, Members on the other side of the aisle have been 
wailing that the border was an emergency situation; that the country 
was in urgent crisis.
  As the senior Senator from Wyoming said, ``This crisis requires 
swift, serious, and substantive action,'' or like the senior Senator 
from Texas said, ``This current crisis cries out for a solution'' and 
``nobody believes the status quo is acceptable.''
  How about the words of Speaker Johnson just 1 month ago. Just 1 month 
ago, he said that the time to act on the border is yesterday.

  This morning, Republicans are singing a new tune. Suddenly, this 
crisis is not so urgent. Suddenly, we need to take even more time 
before we address this crisis. One hard-right Republican Member of the 
House even ridiculously suggested that we wait until after November. 
This morning, a member of the Republican leadership who had recently 
called for swift action now says that action must wait until after the 
next election.
  Give me a break.
  Today, this is the new Republican line on the border: It is an 
emergency, but it can wait 12 months or until the end of time.
  What utter bunk.
  A cynic might suggest that this request for more time was a political 
ploy. But maybe we should take the Republicans at their word. Maybe we 
should take them at their word when they say: There is absolutely no 
reason to agree to policies that will further enable Joe Biden. Or when 
they say: Let me tell you, I am not willing to do too damn much right 
now to help a Democrat.
  That is why this is a gloomy day. That is why the Republican Party is 
being thrown into disrepute by many of its own members back in their 
States.
  Some Republicans will claim they have not had enough time to read the 
bill. Some Republicans will claim that they want an amendment process. 
Some will claim that they want guarantees their amendments will be 
accepted. Some Republicans will claim we need more time for debate and 
consideration. My guess is, they will ultimately want 10 to 12 months.
  Finally, some Republicans will claim that we should separate--new 
tune--separate border solutions from funding for Ukraine.
  I would like to address each of those claims right here, right now. 
For those who claim they have not had enough time to read the bill, on 
January 25, 10 Republican Senators wrote me a letter.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:


[[Page S403]]




                                                  U.S. Senate,

                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2024.
       Dear Majority Leader Schumer: On January 18, 2023, you 
     stated on the Senate floor that ``we need to do something to 
     fix the situation at the border.'' We agree. The crisis at 
     our nation's southern border is unprecedented. It's the worst 
     it's ever been in our country's history.
       You also said that ``it is my goal for the Senate to move 
     forward to the national security supplemental as soon as 
     possible.'' We anticipate that legislation to address the 
     crisis at our southern border will be in that supplemental.
       It is crucial that we ensure border legislation is passed 
     correctly, not just quickly. We must fully understand what is 
     in the bill, how the Biden administration will implement the 
     bill, and how it will impact our states and local 
     communities. Therefore, we request the following:
       Seventy-two hours to elapse between the text of the full 
     national security supplemental bill being made public and the 
     first vote on the legislation in the Senate. This will allow 
     Senators to review the legislation fully.
       Cabinet Secretaries and other administration officials 
     charged with the bill's implementation be made available to 
     answer questions in an all-Senators meeting. This will allow 
     all Senators to ask questions and learn how this will impact 
     their state.
       We believe this legislative effort can lead to a secure, 
     safe, and operational border. For that to happen, however, we 
     must have the opportunity to ensure the legislation does just 
     that.
           Sincerely,
     Pete Ricketts,
     Bill Cassidy, M.D.,
     John Barrasso,
     Tom Cotton,
     Joni K. Ernst,
     Markwayne Mullin,
     James E. Risch,
     Lindsey O. Graham,
     Dan Sullivan,
     Roger F. Wicker,
       U.S. Senators.

  Mr. SCHUMER. In that letter Senators Ricketts, Barrasso, Cassidy, 
Cotton, Ernst, Graham, Mullin, Sullivan, Risch, and Wicker asked one 
thing of me before the first vote on legislation. They asked for 72 
hours to read the bill. We met that request. The bill was posted at 
6:45 p.m. Sunday, February 4. If they want until 6:45 tomorrow evening, 
that is fine with me. Actually, I will even offer to delay that vote 
until sometime on Thursday to give even more time for Senators to make 
up their minds.
  But I suspect they won't accept even that offer because they really 
don't want more time. They are just using it as an excuse. In fact, it 
will surprise no one that some of the signers of that letter actually 
did not wait 72 hours before they rejected the bill. Senator Cotton 
declared his opposition after 16 hours and 48 minutes, less than 25 
percent of the requested time. Senator Risch took a little longer--an 
additional 15 minutes--to read the bill before announcing his 
opposition. Clearly, this wasn't about having 72 hours. That is OK. I 
can recognize when Senators grandstand. But this--this--is no time for 
grandstanding. This is a time for serious people to work together to 
solve serious problems.
  Mr. President, Senators are elected to vote, not to be afraid, run 
away, make excuses, when it comes to voting on the tough issues. 
Senators are elected to debate and deliberate, not just to say no when 
a former President instructs them to. We were sent here to make laws, 
not just to make speeches.
  If my colleagues want more time, fine--fine. All they have to do is 
vote yes tomorrow. That will mean the Senate will have up to 30 hours 
of debate before we lay down the motion to proceed. Again, I want to be 
clear. The vote tomorrow is not about the substance of the bill. No one 
is being asked to take a position on the supplemental tomorrow. The 
only thing a ``yes'' vote would allow is for the Senate simply to begin 
to consider, discuss, and debate the vitally important issues before us 
now. And we will have plenty of time to do so because we will stay here 
in session as long as it takes.
  That brings me to the Republican's second claim. They want an 
amendment process. Well, during my time as majority leader, I presided 
over more amendment votes than the Senate held in all 4 years of the 
Trump administration. I would like to remind my colleagues about Senate 
procedure. If you want a chance to amend a bill, it turns out you 
actually need to get on the bill first. Voting no says no amendments. 
Further, once we are on the bill, you still possess the power to kill 
the entire bill if the amendment process is not to your liking. You can 
hold out for your amendments. You can hold out if you want to reread 
the bill again and again. And you can hold out if your amendments fail.
  But our Republican colleagues--we know this--really don't want any of 
those things. And when they won't, they forfeit their ability to 
address the border situation at all. When they vote no, they forfeit 
their ability to address the border situation at all.
  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes on the 
bill so we can discuss amendments, timing, and any other issues. The 
issues in Ukraine, in Israel, humanitarian aid, the South Pacific, and 
the border are urgent. So many of my colleagues have said they are 
urgent. Well, let's vote. It is urgent. We spent months talking and 
debating. It is time to vote. Make no mistake about it. A ``no'' vote 
says: I never want to move forward on the border, not with amendments, 
not without amendments, not now, not later. We must move forward. We 
cannot wait any longer. We have waited long enough.
  Now, for my Republican colleagues who say that we need more time to 
debate and consider the bill and ``I don't want to be jammed,'' I have 
a question. In September, you told us we cannot provide support to the 
people in Ukraine without addressing the border crisis. In December, 
you told us that leaving for Christmas break was more important than 
solving the border crisis. Now, in February, you are telling us you 
need more time. So the question I would like answered and that the 
American people want an answer to is this: What date would work, my 
Republican friends? If you don't want to solve the border crisis and 
fight Putin today or tomorrow, when do you want it? Would Saturday the 
24th of February be a good day for you, the day that marks the second 
anniversary of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, so it can have symbolic 
value? And since that falls on a weekend, maybe we could vote on Monday 
the 26. Just let me know. We can schedule it. We have other options. 
You just have to tell us what day would work.
  We can change the schedule, but we are voting to move to proceed 
Wednesday night or if you want the extra day, Thursday. Would you be 
willing to address those tough issues in March, in April, in June, in 
July?
  Mr. President, I suppose I won't get a response because it seems the 
only date Republicans seem to care about is November 5, election day. 
We all know what is going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the 
chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail instead 
of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather 
let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield instead of being tough on Putin. 
And instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are 
ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote 
down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think is 
their party's political interest above the interest of the country.
  It is my hope, but not my expectation, that my friends across the 
aisle will resist the former President's exhortations and do what is 
right. That is why the Senate will move forward with our vote tomorrow. 
If Senators vote yes, we have options--more time to debate, an 
opportunity to consider amendments. If Senators vote no, those Senators 
should have to explain why they are ready to let the border emergency--
which they so decried--why would they let it continue? We have had 4 
months--4 months--of dithering and delay. Tomorrow, the American people 
will find out whether Senators seek border security and oppose Russian 
expansionism or whether they stand with former President Trump in 
support of the chaos and Vladimir Putin.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for

                                  Iran

  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to comment on Friday's 
strikes against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran's 
proxies in Iraq and Syria.
  Last week, I called on the President to take decisive action in 
response to the more than 165 attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq, 
Syria, Jordan, and in the Red Sea, including the tragic death of three 
soldiers in Jordan. The President's half-measures had failed, with 
deadly consequences, and a forceful response was overdue. The President 
must continue to take the necessary measures to protect our troops 
abroad and to maintain freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
  I specifically would like to commend the men and women of the 28th 
Bomb Wing, which is based in South Dakota at Ellsworth Air Force Base 
but now has a contingent of about 250 airmen operating out of Dyess Air 
Force Base while our airfield is closed.
  The 28th Bomb Wing not only participated in Friday's strike against 
85 targets, but it did so flying what is known as a CONUS-to-CONUS 
mission--that is, taking off from American soil, hitting overseas 
targets, and returning to base in a single, marathon flight.
  This ability to generate combat power that can strike anywhere on the 
map is a testament to the professionalism of the 28th Bomb Wing's 
aircrews and maintainers, and it also underscores the importance of 
preserving this capability now and well into the future so that we can 
deter threats and hold adversaries accountable. Global reach anytime, 
anyplace.
  The B-21 bomber, which was unveiled last year and is set to make 
Ellsworth its first home for Main Operating Base 1 later this decade, 
will begin a new era of American airpower, but until that sixth-
generation bomber is fielded, we need to continue full support for 
programs like the B-1 bomber. I will continue to do everything I can 
here in Congress to support both the B-21 and the B-1 missions and the 
men and women who are behind their success.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  The Senator from Washington.

                            Border Security

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, an early report suggests that the Biden 
administration may have set yet another record at our southern border--
and not the good kind. If this early report is accurate, the number of 
migrant encounters at our southern border in January is the highest 
January number ever recorded. That, of course, would follow December's 
recordbreaking number of migrant encounters, which was a staggering 
309,034. That is not only the highest December number ever recorded but 
the highest number for any month ever recorded. Before that, of course, 
there was September's recordbreaking number, and the list goes on.
  The Biden administration has presided over a truly unprecedented 
crisis at our Nation's border. We have had 3 years of recordbreaking 
illegal immigration under the Biden administration. Fiscal year 2021 
saw a recordbreaking 1,734,686 migrant encounters at our southern 
border. Then fiscal year 2022 broke that record, and then fiscal year 
2023 broke that record. They didn't break that 2021 record by a small 
margin, either. Fiscal year 2023 exceeded fiscal year 2021 by a 
staggering 740,000-plus encounters. If the current trajectory 
continues, it is likely that fiscal year 2024 will break the record yet 
again.
  All told, since President Biden took office, there have been more 
than 7 million--million--migrant encounters at our southwest border, 
and that is just counting the individuals who were stopped by Customs 
and Border Protection. Since January 2021, when President Biden took 
office, there have been more than 1.7 million known ``got-aways,'' and 
those are individuals the Border Patrol saw but was unable to 
apprehend. We have no idea how many unknown--unknown--``got-aways'' 
there have been over the same period.
  I could keep throwing out numbers all day, but needless to say, my 
point is this: The situation at our southern border is a disaster, it 
is unprecedented, and it is untenable. We have to get this crisis under 
control.
  I am thankful for Senator Lankford's efforts to address the chaos at 
our southern border. Senator Lankford has spent months now working to 
develop serious border security reform, and his work has further 
highlighted the ways the Biden administration has invited illegal 
immigration and undermined security at our Nation's border.
  The worst border crisis on record will be a defining feature of 
President Biden's legacy, in addition to the high cost of inflation 
imposed on American families and the weakening of America's standing on 
the world's stage.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we recently released the text of the 
supplemental. This bill is about our national security, it is about our 
national credibility, and it is about our future. That is why Democrats 
have been glued to the table, negotiating in good faith every step of 
the way, because the stakes could not be higher.
  On Sunday, we rolled out a bipartisan, compromise package with $60 
billion in aid for Ukraine, $14.1 billion in security assistance for 
Israel, $4.8 billion to support our allies in the Indo-Pacific, $10 
billion for humanitarian assistance, $20 billion for operational needs 
at the border, and more.
  Now, I want to be clear, this is not the bill I would have written on 
my own. It is compromise legislation that came out of negotiations 
between Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. As I have said before, 
I never believed that we should condition emergency aid for our allies 
on unrelated partisan priorities, but Republicans demanded that. They 
insisted we needed not just Executive action at the border or new 
resources but policy changes. So my colleagues--the junior Senator from 
Connecticut and the senior Senator from Arizona--worked around the 
clock, and now we have a bipartisan set of proposals, just as our 
Republican colleagues demanded.
  Now, before I say anything else, this will not be the last word on 
immigration reform. I will keep fighting--and I know many of us will--
day in and day out until we deliver on comprehensive immigration reform 
that creates a pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million 
undocumented immigrants living in America and makes our system work 
better and more fairly. I know we need to finally pass the Dream Act. 
We need an immigration system that creates new pathways for legal 
status, eliminates dysfunction and backlogs, and recognizes that 
immigrants do make America great.
  Immigrants are not just crucial to our economy--although they 
absolutely are--they enrich our communities and strengthen the fabric 
of our country in countless ways. And we should, of course, be inviting 
the world's brightest minds and hardest workers to make America home. 
That will always remain a North Star for me as we push to make our 
system work better and meet new needs as more folks come to our 
country, fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
  We also have to address the root causes of migration in a way that 
promotes stability and mutual economic prosperity for everyone.
  The bipartisan compromise before us does not accomplish all of that. 
Border policy and immigration reform is a very tough issue, and in a 
divided government, compromise is required. So what we have in front of 
us is a tailored package aimed at addressing some of the challenges 
before us and one that can win passage in both Chambers.
  I am not thrilled with several of the provisions, but there are some 
important steps forward in it, like a quarter of a million new family 
and work visas over the next 5 years and pathways to citizenship for 
the brave Afghans who worked alongside our servicemembers during the 
war in Afghanistan.
  The bill would help speed up the processing of asylum claims, ensure 
for the very first time that everyone gets a written explanation of 
their asylum decision, and provide an important downpayment on new 
resources to clear the backlog.
  It would provide immediate work permits for folks who pass through 
the

[[Page S405]]

asylum screenings so they can provide for their families and build a 
life in our country.
  The bill enshrines for the first time a legal right to representation 
for all asylum seekers in expedited removal, and, especially important 
to me, it provides legal counsel for the youngest kids who arrive at 
our borders without a parent, seeking relief in the United States.
  It protects the President's parole authority--another means of 
preventing chaos at our borders.
  It helps ensure that documented Dreamers, the children of H-1B visa 
holders, are not deported.
  It provides critical new resources--a 75-percent boost--for our 
cities and our States and organizations around the country to provide 
lifesaving support to migrants who are already here.
  It also includes funding to help resettle refugees fleeing Putin's 
war and other horrific conflicts across the globe.
  It has significant new investments to not just detect and stop 
fentanyl at our borders but to stop the chemicals used to create it way 
up the supply chain.
  So this bill does leave a lot to be desired, but it is a compromise 
bill. It takes really important steps to get urgently needed aid to our 
allies and innocent civilians, and it was crafted to win bipartisan 
support.
  I will be voting for this package because American leadership is on 
the line here and because aid to our allies, including in Ukraine, and 
humanitarian aid to Gaza cannot wait a moment longer.
  I have tremendous appreciation for the tireless effort my Democratic 
colleagues put into negotiating away some of the worst and most 
partisan proposals. I am not new to brokering deals here in the Senate, 
and I understand that in negotiations, you don't always get what you 
want. In fact, you never do. But I also know that after a bill passes, 
you don't stop pushing for the progress you want to see, and that will 
be the case here. But when it comes to the bill before us, there is no 
reason--none whatsoever--for further drama or delay or partisanship.
  Funding for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific all have 
overwhelming bipartisan support, and Senate and House Republicans alike 
were some of the loudest voices calling for changes to border policy in 
the first place. So despite the flurry of statements from Republicans 
we have seen in the past 24 hours, rushing to judgment, I hope they 
will join us in moving the very steps that they demanded.

  After all, if Republicans kill this deal without even voting, 
throwing out border policies that they demanded--that they demanded--
throwing their Senate colleagues under the bus, and throwing in the 
towel to dictators like Putin, how are they going to have any sort of 
credibility on addressing the border?
  They won't. The American people will rightly see it for the kind of 
naked partisan politics people cannot stand.
  We have a bill here that is serious. It is bipartisan, and it is 
urgently needed by our allies, especially Ukraine. If we do not fully 
meet this moment and soon, we are going to leave families living in a 
more dangerous world--a world where dictators like Putin trample 
democracies without consequences; a world where civilians who are 
caught in crossfire have less hope of getting basic aid, food, water, 
medical care; and a world where allies don't trust our promises and 
adversaries don't heed our warnings.
  That is unacceptable to me, and I urge our colleagues to join me in 
passing this bill through the Senate and in pressing the House to vote 
on this bill without any further delay.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

                      Nomination of Kurt Campbell

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in 
support of the nomination of Kurt Campbell to be Deputy Secretary of 
State.
  The Deputy Secretary of State is one of the most critical roles at 
the Department of State. The Deputy Secretary serves as a key adviser 
to the Secretary, advancing top national security priorities, and 
serves as one of our top diplomats around the world.
  To that end, Mr. Campbell's distinguished career provides him with 
the experience to excel in this position. It includes service in the 
Navy, in the State Department, the Defense Department, and the private 
sector. Mr. Campbell brings more than two decades of service in various 
leaderships, including as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian 
and Pacific Affairs and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian 
and Pacific Affairs.
  He has the expertise to help navigate the Department and our Nation 
through complex global challenges. Having a confirmed Deputy Secretary 
of State is paramount as we work to support our allies and build 
resilient partnerships, and respond to crises and deescalate tensions 
and conflict around the world--from Europe, where maintaining unity and 
support for Ukraine is more critical than ever; to addressing 
challenges in the Indo-Pacific, with the dynamic reaction between 
Beijing and Taipei; to the Middle East, where we must prevent further 
escalation and work toward the release of hostages and avoid the 
humanitarian crisis.
  These require the full diplomatic force of our Nation. At this 
critical moment, the State Department's role in leadership is more 
important than ever. I don't have to remind my colleagues of all the 
challenges we have around the world. We need a full diplomatic corps 
there to represent the United States' interests, and it is critically 
important that we have Mr. Campbell confirmed as Deputy Secretary of 
State.
  I want to take a moment to acknowledge the exceptional leadership of 
Ambassador Victoria Nuland, who has been serving in an acting capacity 
since last year. She is among our Nation's finest diplomats, and we 
have been lucky to have someone of her experience step into this role 
in the interim.

  I must state that I have had many dealings with Ambassador Nuland. 
She has always been very direct with us. She has always been an 
incredibly talented diplomat representing our Nation, and we thank her 
for being willing to take on this extraordinary position during this 
critical time.
  But it is in our national interest to have a Senate-confirmed 
official serving in our Nation's top national security post. Mr. 
Campbell is among the most experienced and most capable officials to be 
nominated to this position.
  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support cloture of Mr. 
Campbell's nomination and to confirm him without delay.
  I yield the floor.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, this is unbelievable. Like, I can't 
believe this is happening. We were all here. This wasn't a dream. This 
really happened.
  Republicans all stood up and said that they wanted a bipartisan bill 
to fix the border. The border is a priority. The border is a crisis.
  We delivered a bipartisan bill to fix the border with the Republican 
Senator appointed by the Republican caucus to cut the deal. And within 
24 hours, before the ink was even dry, Republican Senators decided they 
don't want a bipartisan bill to fix the border. They want to pretend 
they never asked for a bipartisan border bill because what they 
actually want is chaos because that is what Donald Trump says he wants. 
What the hell just happened?
  Here is what happened--because the facts are just the facts. In 
October, Republicans refused to support funding for Ukraine. They voted 
against stopping Putin from making Kyiv a Russian city, not because 
they opposed Ukraine funding, they said, no, because they demanded that 
Ukraine funding be paired with bipartisan border reforms.
  Democrats took them at their word. America took Republicans at their 
word that these two things had to be combined. Republicans appointed a 
lead negotiator--one of their most conservative Members, a serious 
legislator--Senator Lankford, an unquestioned border hawk.
  I represented the Democratic caucus in those negotiations. Now, I 
will be honest with you, a lot of my friends told me that I was crazy. 
They told me that I was hopelessly naive, that Republicans are never 
going to agree to a bipartisan bill to fix the border. This is just a 
setup. You shouldn't go into the negotiating room. It is a trap. But I 
did because, you know what, I am an optimist, maybe a hopeless 
optimist.
  I still believe that when people say things in this body, they mean 
what they say. And I do believe that the border is a mess. It is too 
chaotic. We can't handle 10,000 people crossing on some days.
  And I believe the asylum system is broken, and my constituents, 
whether they be right or left, believe the asylum system is broken. It 
shouldn't take 10 years to process an asylum claim, especially when the 
majority of those asylum claims are ultimately rejected.
  And so I went into the room skeptical that we could get a deal but 
sincere because my party actually wants to fix the problem at the 
border, and we are willing to reach out across the aisle and find a 
compromise in order to do it.
  And so we met for months every day. We took Thanksgiving off. We took 
Christmas off. But that was it because Republicans told us that they 
wanted a bipartisan border deal. We met every Saturday, every Sunday. 
We worked straight through the holidays because we saw an opportunity 
to cut through the politics, to get a bipartisan agreement done, to 
finally start fixing the border.
  We saw that opportunity because Republican Senators told the country 
that if we could find an agreement with their appointed negotiator on 
border policy, that they would support it, and they would support 
funding for Ukraine.
  And against the odds, we made the deal. We actually achieved the 
compromise. And here is just a snapshot of what it does: It allows the 
President to close portions of the border on those days when 10,000 
people are crossing, to funnel people who are applying for asylum in a 
much more orderly manner, to make sure that you don't have those 
chaotic scenes that we have watched on the news.
  It reforms the asylum system, a comprehensive reform, so that it 
doesn't take 10 years to get your asylum claim adjudicated; it will 
take months. And it screens individuals so that no longer are we going 
to let people into the country who don't have a likely positive claim 
of asylum.
  It allows more people to come into the country legally. We expand 
visas so that folks can find nonasylum pathways to come to the country 
or reunite with family or to work. It speaks to our values by making 
sure that the most vulnerable people who come to the country, like 
young, unaccompanied kids have an advocate standing next to them when 
they are making their case for an asylum claim.
  It honors the commitment we made to our Afghan partners by allowing 
those individuals who are in the country today to have a pathway to 
citizenship. And it speaks to the nightmare in many cities where you 
have immigrants who can't work on the streets and in homeless shelters. 
It makes sure that we get more immediate work permits to individuals 
who do have legitimate claims for asylum.
  This bill is not comprehensive immigration reform, but it would fix 
the crisis at the border. It would immediately give the President tools 
to start better managing the border.
  We released the text of the bill on Sunday night at 7 p.m., the first 
serious bipartisan compromise on border policy in a decade, a 
breakthrough, a real chance for this Nation to come together on an 
issue--immigration--that too often divides us. And within 24 hours, by 
7 p.m. Monday night, almost every single Senate Republican, including 
the Senate Republicans who set us on the mission 4 months ago, declared 
that they wouldn't support it. For some of them, it didn't even take 
that long.
  When the text of the bill came out, Senator Lee tweeted that ``it's 
370 pages long. Time to start reading.'' Three minutes later, he 
tweeted again that ``no self-respecting Senator should vote for this 
bill.'' That is either record time for reading a 370-page bill or, more 
likely, Senator Lee didn't even open the PDF.

  What happened? How did Senate Republicans tell us they wanted a 
bipartisan bill only to end up opposing the very bill that they asked 
for?
  Well, here is the simple truth, and there is no way around this: 
Republicans don't want to fix the border. They want the border to 
remain chaotic. They want the asylum system to remain broken because 
Republicans in this country don't view the border as a problem to fix 
anymore. They view it as a problem that needs to be exploited.
  Senate Republicans have been pretty unapologetic about just wanting 
to keep this issue open as an election issue. Less than 24 hours after 
the text came out, one Senator launched killtheborderbill.com, a 
website to fundraise for his campaign. Senator Barrasso said today that 
he can't support the bill; that Americans should just go to the 
upcoming election to solve the border crisis.

[[Page S407]]

  Maybe I am a sucker. Maybe I should be mad at myself, but, yes, I 
believed that there were enough Senate Republicans of good faith who 
would actually support Senator Lankford's sincere efforts to work to 
achieve a bipartisan fix, but I was wrong.
  Senator Lankford doesn't matter. What his colleagues have put him 
through is unforgiveable. Senator McConnell doesn't matter. The 
migrants and regular Americans who are getting screwed by a broken 
immigration system and a broken border don't matter. There is only one 
person who matters to Republicans, and his name is Donald Trump.
  Donald Trump made it clear last month. He told Republicans they 
should oppose any bipartisan bill to fix the border, and he meant it. 
To Trump it didn't matter at all what the policy, what the substance 
was. His only advice was kill any bipartisan bill. Why? Because 
President Trump wants to win an election, and if the border is fixed by 
a bipartisan bill, then that hurts his reelection chances.
  Trump wants chaos at the border because it helps him personally. He 
asked Republicans to back him, and nearly every single Senator did 
exactly that less than 48 hours after introduction of this bill.
  This country should be outraged. Regular people out there don't think 
this is a game. They don't think that the only thing that matters is 
Donald Trump's election odds. They do think the border is broken.
  They have spent the last 40 years hearing about how the border is a 
problem, but they don't see any action from Congress. They are sick of 
this, and they want the two parties to come together to fix the 
problem. And they are going to be furious to find out that when 
Republicans here had the chance to support a bipartisan bill that they 
requested, that they asked for, almost every single Senate Republican 
opposed that bill because Donald Trump wants to keep the chaos.
  There used to be a difference between House Republicans and Senate 
Republicans. I used to explain this fact to my constituents all the 
time. I defended my Senate Republican colleagues. I explained how Trump 
doesn't control the Senate Republican caucus like he controls the 
House, but I don't think that is true any longer.
  I think this conference is just as big a mess as the conference in 
the House. And that is terrible for the border, which will remain a 
wreck because Republicans have just chosen to keep it that way. That is 
terrible for Ukraine, which will soon be overrun by Russia because 
Republicans have chosen to leave it undefended.
  And that is terrible for America because the one group of Republicans 
who used to be able to exercise original thought and independent 
judgment now just seems to be another subsidiary of the Trump campaign.
  I yield the floor.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Sunday night of this last weekend, 
three of our colleagues released the much anticipated text of what has 
come to be known as a bipartisan border deal. In fact, this was 
negotiated by three main principal Senators here in the Senate: Senator 
James Lankford from Oklahoma, Senator Sinema from Arizona, Senator 
Chris Murphy from Connecticut, along with the Biden administration.
  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Lankford, for our part, for 
the time and effort he has invested in this process. I know of no one 
who has worked harder in good faith to try to come up with a solution 
to our broken border.
  I know, like all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle, he is 
outraged by the Biden administration's failure to secure the border, 
and he is eager to find a way to change the policies which will provide 
that security.
  And I think our Democratic colleagues finally realize that the status 
quo on the border is a huge political liability. Well, what Senator 
Lankford hoped to deliver through this process, unfortunately, has 
become increasingly clear that it has not been attainable. 
Notwithstanding his best efforts, this proposal is not what the country 
needs, wants, or deserves, and I would be happy to explain why.
  Given the fact we are operating in divided government, any successful 
reform requires bipartisan support. As I said, Senator Lankford worked 
in good faith with Senator Murphy and Senator Sinema, who also worked 
in good faith, as well as the White House to craft this agreement.
  But I am disappointed that the White House has refused to budge on 
policy changes that would lead to significant improvements; by that I 
mean reduction in the flow of migrants across the southern border.
  For example, this proposal doesn't place significant limits on parole 
authority. Now, just by way of a footnote here, parole authority means 
that the Biden administration has been releasing people who come to the 
border even if they don't claim asylum; and it is, frankly, just a 
population management tool. They are released into the interior of the 
country, given a 2-year permit and a work permit.
  So no matter what we do on the front end in terms of asylum reform or 
the process to deal with this exploitation of the gaps in our asylum 
system, the Biden administration could still parole as many people as 
they wanted to under this proposal.
  As a matter of fact, no changes were made at all to the fact that the 
Biden administration is releasing up to 30,000 migrants from four 
countries each month, presuming or assuming that they actually should 
be released into the country without any claim of asylum or anything 
else. Just letting them come and stay and work.
  This is a huge magnet--a huge magnet--to people coming from those 
four countries, and that is 360,000 migrants a year. And that is just 
the tip of the iceberg. This bill also does not end what has come to be 
known euphemistically as catch-and-release, and it actually creates a 
new system under which migrants who might express an intent to apply 
for asylum must be released from custody even before an initial 
screening interview is completed.
  Just to take a look back, I think it was in 2005 when then-Secretary 
Michael Chertoff came and testified in front of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, and he noticed an uptick in the number of Brazilians that 
were coming across the border. What he testified to under oath is they 
realized that the only way you would provide the deterrence that would 
prevent people from coming illegally into the country is to detain 
them.
  In other words, don't catch-and-release them; catch-and-detain them. 
Determine whether they have a legitimate claim, and if they did not, 
then return them to their country of origin. That actually provided the 
kind of deterrence that addressed that problem at that time, and that 
kind of deterrence is missing in this proposal.
  And as I said, it actually creates a new system that can be exploited 
by the people who continue to get rich smuggling migrants to the United 
States from around the world, the same criminal organizations that are 
also involved in smuggling drugs into the United States.
  And the only way you avoid catch-and-release and you provide catch-
and-detain is, you need more detention space. And this proposal does 
not provide adequate detention space and assures that migrants will 
continue to be released into the interior of the country. Again, a huge 
magnet, or in the terminology that the Border Patrol has taught me, he 
calls this a pull factor. The push factors are the reasons the people 
want to leave their home country: violence, poverty, desire for a 
better life. We all understand that. But what the pull factor is, is 
the perception that there are no consequences to coming illegally.

  Legal immigration has been one of the biggest blessings for this 
country that we have ever received because almost a million people a 
year are naturalized. They go through the system the right way. They 
take the citizenship test. They go through the background check, and 
then they become American citizens like you and I. That is an 
unmitigated blessing, in my opinion. Illegal immigration--or 
outsourcing our immigration policy to drug and criminal cartels--is a 
disaster.
  Well, this proposal also does not make a meaningful investment in 
enforcement resources to actually remove people who don't have the 
legal authorization to stay in the United States. That is a job 
ordinarily performed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. So 
if people can come to the country, can be released either on parole or 
released while they are awaiting the decision on their asylum claims, 
and there is no mechanism to make sure that they are repatriated to 
their home country if they don't qualify to stay, then they are going 
to continue to come, which is the reason why we have seen roughly 7 
million migrants come to the United States and stay over the last 3 
years.
  In other words, this proposal does not fix the single biggest policy 
failures that have contributed to this crisis. I believe this is the 
responsibility, again, of the Biden administration, which has done 
everything they can to handcuff their negotiators and to fail to meet 
the requirements of what a proposal would look like that would actually 
make things better or would actually work.
  I have said from the beginning that I would only support an agreement 
or proposal that would make significant policy changes and change--by 
that, I mean reduce--the influx of humanity coming across the border, 
and this proposal does not meet that requirement.
  But this is, while disappointing, it is not entirely surprising. 
After all, President Biden is the leader of an open-borders 
administration that has ushered in the largest border crisis our 
country has ever seen. The only reason I think President Biden all of a 
sudden took an interest in the border is because he saw the approaching 
election and his plummeting poll numbers.
  Since President Biden took office 3 years ago, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection has encountered more than 7 million migrants--I 
mentioned that a moment ago--7 million in 3 years. And that doesn't 
even count the 1.7 million ``got-aways.'' ``Got-aways'' are people who 
are seen, although not detained, on cameras and other sensors and who 
are intentionally evading law enforcement. You can only imagine what 
they are up to, and I assure you, it is no good.
  But we have seen, under President Biden, nearly double the number of 
illegal crossings that we saw during the entire 8 years President Obama 
was in office.
  Now, to be clear, Congress has not dramatically changed immigration 
laws in the interim that caused this dramatic increase in migration 
under President Biden. Under President Trump, the laws were essentially 
the same, and there was no crisis of such epic proportions. This fiasco 
is a direct result of the policies and the actions of the Biden 
administration. The President created what, in effect, is a high-

[[Page S409]]

powered magnet for illegal immigration.
  The problem isn't just that more migrants than ever are crossing into 
the United States, it is also that more migrants than ever are being 
released into the United States.
  The Biden administration has gone to great lengths to ensure that 
people who cross the border illegally can stay here. It is really, if 
you think about it, an insult to the people who follow the law and 
immigrate legally. They wait patiently in line. They play by the rules. 
And in the meantime, the Biden administration is waving through 
millions of migrants who are violating those rules and who are not 
waiting in line. Instead of detain and deport, this administration has 
focused all of its energy on catch-and-release.
  Last month, Secretary Mayorkas told Border Patrol Agents that more 
than 85 percent of migrants who were caught crossing the border were 
being released. Now, this is from a man whose responsibility it is to 
enforce our immigration laws, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and 
he admitted to Border Patrol Agents that 85 percent who were caught 
crossing the border illegally were simply released.
  Again, this is not a major shift in immigration policy. The Congress 
hasn't tied President Biden's hands or restricted his ability to detain 
and deport illegal immigrants. President Biden was dealt the exact same 
hand as his recent predecessors when it comes to enforcement 
authorities, but he has simply refused to use them, which is what gets 
to the root of the problem here: The White House really doesn't want a 
solution; it wants political cover.

  President's Biden mishandling of the border has landed him in red ink 
in the polls. He is looking at the upcoming election, and he needs to 
change his posture and the appearance that he looks like he is actually 
taking this seriously for the first time in 3 years, but I have no 
expectation that this will lead to any sort of meaningful shift in 
enforcement.
  Congress can pass all the laws that we want, but it is the executive 
branch, the President of the United States, that enforces those laws. 
And when they are not enforced, under our system, unfortunately, there 
is not much recourse. After all, if Joe Biden really wanted to fix the 
border breakdown, he could have done so at any point in the last 3 
years. He could have used existing authorities to hold lawbreakers 
accountable and provide deterrence, which would have mitigated the flow 
of humanity across our border.
  Instead, he created new incentives, new pull factors, from parole to 
the CBP One app. Now, President Biden has finally realized that this is 
such a liability that 9 months before the next election, he has decided 
he wants to change his position--at least publicly. But I can tell you, 
we are not interested in being complicit in a PR stunt. We are 
interested in actually securing the border and deterring illegal 
immigration.
  So, on Wednesday, when we vote on whether to proceed to the proposal, 
along with aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, I will vote no 
on the motion to proceed.
  To be clear, this is not no; this is not now. In other words, when 
cloture ``fails,'' which is the technical procedural term, it means we 
need to continue to discuss this and to work it out and come up with a 
better solution.
  But fixing this bill really requires us to go back to the drawing 
board and for the administration to accept some of the border 
enforcement proposals that we have called for, like ending catch-and-
release.
  Voting for this proposal, some 300 pages of technical immigration law 
changes, 3 days after it was released is really a bad joke. There is 
just no way, given the complexity of the subject matter, that Senators 
can do their due diligence and really understand what the impact of 
this proposal will be.
  Now, I have spent most of my career in the Senate on the Immigration 
Subcommittee. And obviously coming from a border state, we are at 
ground zero when it comes to this crisis. But many of our colleagues 
have not steeped themselves in the complexities of immigration law, and 
we need time--all of us need time--in order to do our due diligence to 
understand both the intended and the potential unintended consequences.
  In the 3 years since President Biden took office, the security 
situation at the southern border has dramatically deteriorated. I think 
at last count there were about 170 individuals on the Terrorist 
Watchlist that were detained at the border. We have no idea--and the 
Biden administration can't tell you--how many more individuals on the 
Terrorist Watchlist were among those 1.7 million ``got-aways.''
  In the years I have been representing Texas in the Senate, there have 
been many ups and downs in migration levels at the border. There have 
been surges, some caused by events beyond our borders, others triggered 
by policies from the occupant of the White House. There have also been 
drops in migration levels, some caused by events like the pandemic, 
others a result of stricter policies that have actually deterred 
illegal immigration.
  In the countless conversations I have had with folks along the Texas-
Mexico border, everyone has shared the same sentiment: They have never 
ever seen it as bad as it is now. Law enforcement, local elected 
officials, NGOs--nongovernmental organizations--and private property 
owners agree: This is unprecedented and unsustainable. We need a major 
policy shift, not a figleaf. We need a major policy shift to address 
the Biden administration's many failures, and we need a change of 
behavior, not just in the policy but in actually enforcing the laws 
that Congress has passed.
  Because our colleagues have--and the Biden administration in 
particular has--refused to budge on policy changes that would actually 
force his administration to apply the law to deter illegal immigration, 
I cannot support it as written.
  But now, as I said, the majority leader, the Senator from New York, 
has teed up a process that would force us to vote on this massive bill 
totaling, I think the last count, $112 billion, including this border 
provision, just 3 days after the full text has been released. At this 
point, Senator Schumer has given our colleagues a binary choice: Take 
it or leave it. For me, the choice is obvious. I will not vote just no; 
I will vote not now.
  We need to continue this process. We need to see a change in 
behavior. We need to see a change in real policies that will prevent 
and deter this fast humanitarian and public safety crisis occurring at 
our border under President Biden's open border policies.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with me today are two of my colleagues

both for their good work.
  Energy suicide, that is what I want to talk about: energy suicide. 
President Biden is committing energy suicide for America. Regrettably--
and I mean that--regrettably, too many times in the past 3 years and on 
too many issues we have seen President Biden act as a sock puppet for a 
faction of neosocialist Americans who don't like our country, who think 
our country was wicked when it was founded and that it is even more 
wicked today. And this faction, which President Biden has supported far 
too often, thinks our country must be torn down and rebuilt, and, of 
course, they want to be the ones to rebuild it.

  Now this faction has turned its sights, with the help of President 
Biden, on America's hard-fought energy independence. President Biden 
just aided this faction in destroying America's energy independence and 
committing energy suicide by declaring a moratorium on new liquefied 
natural gas terminals in America. Apparently, President Biden's new 
policy is to give up our own oil and gas and buy the energy we need 
from countries that hate us. So those countries that hate us will have 
more money to buy weapons to try to kill us. Stupidity. Stupidity 
should hurt more. Now, I realize you can't fix stupid, but you can vote 
it out.
  America's ability to be energy independent is one of our greatest 
strengths. We are a big country. We are a big, wide, open, diverse, 
sometimes dysfunctional, imperfect, but essentially good country. This 
is a country that is filled with oil and natural gas and coal and 
uranium and plutonium. It is filled with rare Earth minerals. It

[[Page S410]]

is filled with roaring rivers and just about everything else you need 
to power this economy, to help families live the American dream, and we 
even have a little bit leftover to help our friends. American ingenuity 
did that. Now, Louisiana is a big part of the equation, and we are 
very, very proud to be a leader in energy production.
  Not every country is as blessed as America. Our friends in Europe, 
for example, were relying on Russian oil and gas for their energy when 
Putin invaded Ukraine and then cut off their supply. This paralyzed 
many European leaders. They didn't know how they were going to run 
their businesses. They didn't know how they were going to heat their 
homes. They were totally dependent on Vladimir Putin and Russia. 
Fortunately, they had a friend. They had a friend in the United States 
of America, and we helped them out, and we kept their businesses 
running, and we kept their homes heated. And do you know how we did it? 
Do you know what we did it with? American liquefied natural gas. 
American liquefied natural gas.
  Energy independence. One way to look at it: Energy independence is 
America's jackpot lottery ticket. Now, we have worked hard for it, but 
it is our jackpot lottery ticket. But for some reason, President Biden 
wants to light our winning numbers on fire. He is committing energy 
suicide. Did I mention that?
  At every turn--at every turn--the Biden administration has taken 
steps to make it more difficult, more expensive, and sometimes flatout 
impossible to produce, transport, and sell the energy products we need 
to power this great country. These foolish policies--the latest of 
which is a moratorium on LNG--these foolish policies are killing 
American jobs. They are killing American jobs. They are driving up 
energy prices. They are jeopardizing our national security. And it 
needs to stop.
  Natural gas is the latest victim. President Biden's Department of 
Energy recently announced that it was issuing a ``pause''--a ``pause''; 
that is Washington-speak--a ``pause'' on all new and pending permits 
for liquefied natural gas export projects. Can you believe that?
  Liquefied natural gas--it is not complicated. America helped invent 
it. You just take natural gas in its gaseous form and you cool it, turn 
it into a liquid, put it on a ship, and you can send it all over the 
world. That is how we kept Europe open after Putin cut off Europe's oil 
and natural gas. It was a lifeline for our allies in Europe. It was a 
lifeline for many of our friends in West Asia.
  President Biden, before this moratorium, promised our allies in 
Europe that they could count on us for their LNG needs, and now 
President Biden has chosen to stab America's LNG producers and our 
allies in the back--not in the front, in the back--by prohibiting the 
development of new LNG export permits.
  This decision is going to kill dozens--dozens--of multibillion-dollar 
new terminal projects, including a project in Louisiana that we call 
Calcasieu Pass 2--$20 billion down the drain. Calcasieu Pass 2--a 
private project, a private sector project--cost $20 billion. It was set 
to be the largest LNG export terminal in the United States. It would 
have brought thousands of good jobs to Louisiana and to America. It 
would have produced energy to keep this country safe, to keep this 
country warm, and to help our friends. But President Biden has put all 
those jobs and the terminal itself in jeopardy. Why? Politics. To 
appease that neosocialist faction that I talked about who doesn't even 
like our country. Why?
  But, you know, the ironic thing about this--the whack jobs who talked 
the President into this said: Well, we want you to help the 
environment.
  Attacking the natural gas industry actually hurts the environment. 
You don't have to be an astrophysicist to figure that out. Natural gas 
is cleaner than coal. Natural gas is cleaner than cow chips. Natural 
gas is cleaner than wood. That is what millions--billions of our 
world's citizens are going to use if they don't have access to natural 
gas.
  As a result of natural gas--natural gas drove a 32-percent reduction 
in American carbon emissions. We reduced our carbon emissions by 32 
percent from 2005 to 2019, and we did it with natural gas. Also, at the 
same time, we helped families pay half as much to heat their homes. We 
cut the price of the energy needs of the average American, and we 
created 1.4 million new jobs. The whole world wins, not loses. The 
whole world wins--including the economy--when Americans produce natural 
gas. But President Biden is going to pause all that success because 
some meathead activist on TikTok doesn't like natural gas. Give me a 
break.
  The President's LNG ruling is foolish. It demonstrates world-beating 
vacuity and deep, profound stupidity. It is also the most recent of 
many actions--I say regrettably, and I mean it--it is also the most 
recent of many actions that President Biden has taken to undermine 
America's energy security.

  Before he even took office--remember the campaign?--before he even 
took office, President Biden said--this is what he told the American 
people: ``I guarantee you. I guarantee you. We're going to end fossil 
fuel.''
  ``I guarantee you. . . . We're going to end fossil fuel.''
  Since his very first day in office, he has tried to do that, no 
matter how much it hurts Louisianians, no matter how much it hurts our 
allies and our friends, no matter how much it hurts the American 
people. Let me just give you a few examples.
  On his first day, the first day he was President, President Biden 
blocked the Keystone XL Pipeline. It would have made transporting crude 
oil from our friends in Canada safer and cleaner. It would have been 
good for the environment. President Biden's Department of Energy 
reported that canceling--his own Department said this, for God's sake--
President Biden's Department of Energy said, after he made this 
decision, that canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline cost 59,000 American 
jobs, resulted in an economic loss of $1.3 billion.
  Stupidity should hurt more.
  Next, the Biden administration blocked all oil and natural gas 
drilling on Federal lands. He cut off 25 percent of America's drilling 
rights.
  Then he placed restrictive emission caps on American coal and natural 
gas power plants that would force them to invest in costly new 
equipment or switch to hydrogen.
  Then, just recently, he canceled seven oil and gas drilling leases, 
ending future drilling on 10 million acres--not 10,000 acres but 10 
million acres--of land in northern Alaska.
  Then he approved just three offshore drilling leases--the fewest 
number of offshore drilling sites approved by any President since 
leasing began in America.
  Now, he is not just killing fossil fuels. He told us he was going to 
do it, and, by God, he is doing it. But he is not just killing fossil 
fuel projects; he is killing projects that are essential for wind and 
for solar too.
  Wind and solar energy and the electric cars that President Biden 
wants Americans to drive all rely on batteries. Duh--that is why they 
call them electric. Those batteries require rare Earth minerals: 
cobalt, silver, copper, nickel. You can't just go to the Piggly Wiggly 
and buy those things; you have to mine them. We can mine those minerals 
in the United States, but once again, the Biden administration wants 
Louisianans and Americans to rely on countries that hate us for these 
minerals instead of mining for them at home.
  For example, President Biden recently announced a ban on all copper 
and nickel mining in Minnesota's boundary waters--all of them. The 
Biden administration's EPA also proposed a rule that would allow 
Governors, blue State Governors--I am looking at you, California; I am 
looking at you, Illinois; I am looking at you, New York--that would 
allow blue State Governors to block rare Earth mining permits in their 
States. In fact, America's only cobalt mine closed on President Biden's 
watch.
  Foolish political energy policies make life harder for Louisiana and 
American families. Electric prices are already up 23 percent nationwide 
since President Biden took office, and that is just a fact. Look it up. 
Go to Google. Let me say that again. Electricity prices are up 23 
percent on average nationwide since President Biden took office. Gas 
prices are up 32 percent. They come down some, thank God, but they are 
still up 32 percent.

[[Page S411]]

  While Louisianans struggle under President Biden's energy- and job-
killing policies, our adversaries can't stop winning.
  Let's take Iran. Iran's oil imports are at a 5-year high. The 
Ayatollah in Iran--this guy made enough money to resume funding 
terrorist attacks on American bases. He is doing it all over the world. 
Do you know why? Because President Biden lets him. We have sanctions on 
Iran; the President will not enforce them.
  Venezuela. Let's take Venezuela, another enemy of our 
country. Venezuela's oil imports increased 12 percent in 2023. Do you 
know why? President Biden took the sanctions off of them.

  China is probably the biggest winner of them all. Even when President 
Biden tries to help the American people afford his surging energy 
costs, China wins. China wins.
  I will give you an example. The Biden administration allowed a 
Chinese-owned company to buy up fuel from our strategic natural 
petroleum reserve. We have a strategic natural petroleum reserve. We 
buy up oil, millions of barrels. We store that oil underground in case 
we need it, in case we can't get oil from anywhere else. It is our 
energy savings account. Well, President Biden decided to sell some. He 
decided to sell it. Do you know whom he sold it to? China. China.
  It was a move so foolish that the House and the Senate, which usually 
can't agree on the fact that the sky is blue, both passed bills to 
prevent China from ever tapping into our petroleum reserve again. You 
can't make this stuff up, folks.
  Energy independence keeps America safe; it keeps America strong; it 
keeps America prosperous.
  Louisianans--I don't know about other States, but I suspect other 
Americans believe like Louisianans. Louisianans do not want to rely 
upon the whims of our adversaries to keep our country running.
  We cannot let President Biden commit energy suicide--we can't--to 
appease the radical left, the ``loonwing,'' of his party.
  So I ask my colleagues to join me in pushing back against President 
Biden's anti-energy agenda and his moratorium on liquefied natural gas. 
Why? Because stupidity should hurt more.
  I yield the floor to my good friend from Kansas.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.

                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 543

  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate adopt our resolution expressing the sense of the Senate 
that the Governors of the individual States have a constitutional right 
to repel the dangerous and ongoing invasion across the U.S. southern 
border.
  Joe Biden has the power to secure our borders. Instead, he has chosen 
to break the law, resulting in the worst border crisis in American 
history.
  Frankly, I don't know how the President sleeps at night knowing that 
300 young Americans will die today from fentanyl poisoning: 300 
yesterday, 300 tomorrow. Three hundred thousand people have died from 
fentanyl poisoning since he took office.
  Along with that, there are terrorists, Chinese communist nationals, 
cartels. And worse, they are all living in the interior of our country.
  Since our Commander in Chief won't stop this historic crisis, an 
invasion declaration, as defined by the U.S. Constitution, allows 
Congress to recognize each State's right to secure their own borders. 
Where Joe Biden fails to put Americans' safety first, our resolution 
acknowledges each State's right to secure their borders themselves, as 
leaders like Texas Governor Greg Abbott have. The cartels and the CCP 
should not have more operational control of our borders than we do.
  We have reviewed the big picture here. Let's take a closer look. I 
think the first question we all ask is, Is this an invasion? Well, to 
have an invasion, you have to have invaders. And as we try to 
understand what the Constitution means, it is good to go back to some 
of those Founding Fathers when they defined what they thought were 
``invaders.''
  It is interesting that James Madison called pirates and barbarians 
invaders. And just like the barbarians of Madison's time, today's 
cartels and terrorists are those invaders acting like pirates of the 
day.
  So then let's talk about is this an invasion? Do we have an invasion 
on our southern border? You know, I tried to think what analogies I 
could give of what it was like when I visited the southern border. But 
we are here in DC, so I will kind of paint a picture of what I think it 
would look like if this invasion were occurring right here in DC.
  If you could imagine with me what it would look like if there were 
10,000 ships coming up the Potomac River over the last 3 years--10,000 
ships, each with 1,000 people from over 180 different nations; 10,000 
ships, 1,000 people from 180 different nations. Let's pretend they come 
up the Potomac River and they lay anchor right out here at the Wharf 
and those people slowly get off one at a time. The way I would envision 
this is one of those ships is full of known terrorists and Chinese 
nationals. There would be 80 ships with aliens of interest--people from 
countries that wish harm to America. There would be 200 ships anchored 
out here where people would hop off the ship and just disappear into 
the night--200 ships with 1,000 people on it disappearing into the 
night, and we have no idea who they are or where they are. There would 
be another 200 ships--200 ships with 1,000 people--that President Biden 
would give parole to, just say: You are fine. We don't care what reason 
you are here for, here is your parole slip. And then sprinkled in 
amongst these ships are criminals, murderers, rapists, thugs, drug 
traffickers, human traffickers, and thieves. Does that sound like an 
invasion to you?
  Next, why do we need to declare this an invasion? Well, what our 
resolution does is give State Governors more powers to defend 
themselves. If the Federal Government is not doing their job, then it 
would make sense that the Governors would have the right to defend 
themselves, to defend the people of their States.
  Let me explain a little bit further. I am a physician; I am not an 
attorney, definitely not a constitutional lawyer. But fortunately for 
all of us, the Constitution was written, for the most part, by common 
people just like us so that common people like us could read it and 
understand it.
  So what does the Constitution say about an invasion? Remember, 
everybody up here swore an oath to defend that Constitution. Members of 
Congress, the White House, the President, we have all sworn an oath to 
uphold the Constitution.
  This is what the Constitution says in article IV, section 4: It 
promises that the Federal Government ``shall protect each [State] 
against Invasion.'' This is a constitutional law that the Federal 
Government shall protect each State against invasion.
  Now, we have already established that the Federal Government has not 
done its job with this invasion of 10 million people that has already 
occurred. I don't think anyone can argue that point out there.
  But, fortunately, our forefathers anticipated such an incidence that 
someday we would have a President who didn't love this country, didn't 
recognize that we have a sovereign border, and would indeed allow some 
10 million people illegally across our border, so they have in the 
Constitution from article I, section 10, clause 3: The States have 
sovereign interest in protecting their borders.
  So if the Federal Government doesn't do its job, the States have the 
ability--the constitutional right--to protect their borders.
  This is the last point I will make from the Constitution, and maybe 
this is a little tricky, but the Constitution goes on to say in clause 
3 of section 10 of article I:

       No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress . . . 
     engage in War, unless actually invaded.

  Let me say that again:

       No State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . . 
     engage in War, unless actually invaded.

  That is why we are here today. The Senate needs to declare that our 
southern border has actually been invaded to empower the Governor of 
Texas to protect his people.
  Look, this invasion has occurred. We have established that. To say 
otherwise, to say this is not an invasion, I think, would be a false 
statement for anybody.
  The President has not done his constitutional duty. We have 
established

[[Page S412]]

that. Thus, we must invoke and concur with the Governor of Texas that 
an actual invasion has occurred. And the Governor of Texas, Governor 
Abbott, has not just a moral responsibility but the constitutional 
right to invoke his power and authority to do everything in his 
capability to protect the good people of Texas.
  I commend and compliment Operation Lone Star. They have come up with 
more than 35,000 felony charges. They have seized over 450 million 
lethal doses of fentanyl. Again, 450 million lethal doses of fentanyl--
that is enough to kill every man, woman, and child in America more than 
once.
  That is why I am here today, to lend my support and my hope that the 
entire unanimous consent and support of the Senate would be with the 
Governor of Texas and the good people of Texas.
  Mr. President, as in legislative session, and notwithstanding rule 
XXII, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of S. Res. 543, which is at the desk. I further ask the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from California.
  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, these past 
2 weeks have given the American people a clear window into the 
Republican mind when it comes to immigration. They can't decide if 
immigration reform is the responsibility of Congress or if it is the 
responsibility of the President. They can't decide if the border is in 
crisis or if they would rather wait until after the election to talk 
about it or try to do something about it.
  Today, in this resolution, they are doubling down on declaring an 
``invasion'' and vilifying immigrants, while preventing the Federal 
Government from keeping order on the border.
  My first message to my Republican colleagues here today is this: Make 
up your mind. Do you want to get serious about immigration reform or 
not?
  They can't do it, and these past few weeks we saw why. Republicans 
believe that fear of our border translates into turnout at the ballot 
box. And because they believe that a narrative of chaos and fear would 
help Donald Trump in November, they are saying the quiet part out loud. 
They are saying it. They are repeating it. They are amplifying it on 
social media.
  It is the same reason that they can greet Secretary Mayorkas at the 
negotiation table during these supplemental negotiations with one hand, 
while with their other hand they file baseless impeachment articles 
against him.
  Today's resolution is just as unserious as it was the last time that 
they brought it up.
  Let's put aside, for a moment, the obvious constitutional concerns, 
put aside, for a moment, and discuss what giving immigration powers to 
Governors would look like.
  Colleagues, the fact is, you don't even have to imagine. Let's look 
at what is happening in Texas. Governor Abbott has shown us the cruelty 
and lawlessness of what it would lead to: unconstitutional legislation 
to terrorize immigrants in Texas, putting them at risk of racial 
profiling and civil rights violations; razor-lined buoys that have 
pushed asylum seekers and their families, including small children--
nursing babies, colleagues, nursing babies--into dangerous waters with 
deadly consequences--you want to know why we talk about humanity; this 
is happening--and razor wire along the border that prevents Federal 
officials from doing their job of securing the border; State 
governments preventing Federal officials from doing their job.
  Is that what you want? For the self-proclaimed party of law and 
order, Republicans are acting like anything but.
  Now, let's not lose sight of the very real danger of this kind of 
action and this kind of rhetoric. The idea that immigrants are invading 
has radicalized people in our country to perpetuate terrible violence 
in the not so distant past, including the 2019 shooting in an El Paso 
Walmart, where a White nationalist murdered 23 people, Hispanic 
families who were back-to-school shopping.
  My colleague from Kansas asked something about being able to sleep at 
night. Since that day, I have not been able to sleep as well at night 
for fear of the same happening in my community, to my family.
  Now, I agree that the asylum system is outdated and in need of 
modernization. We must have a border that is more secure and more 
orderly and humane. But there is absolutely not an invasion happening, 
as our Republican colleagues have tried to portray. People arriving at 
our borders are seeking protection for themselves and their families, 
seeking refuge from violence and political persecution from oppressive 
regimes, exercising their legal right to seek asylum--a legal right to 
seek asylum that we established back in World War II.
  Today's resolution would represent a fundamental disregard for the 
Constitution and the rule of law, and it would undoubtedly lead to more 
cruelty at the border and throughout the country, for that matter, not 
just at the border. It is for that reason that I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Alabama.
  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I am proud today to join my colleague 
Dr. Marshall on the floor to support the State of Texas in their 
efforts to secure the disaster at the southern border.
  I have been there many times. I would challenge my Democratic 
colleagues: How many times have you been to the southern border in 
Texas to see this disaster?
  Right now, the Biden administration is actively trying to stop the 
State of Texas from protecting their and our border. Meanwhile, 
Democrats are telling the press that they want to fix the border crisis 
that President Biden has created. It has taken 3 years. But they say 
that the Republicans won't let them. That is not true.
  The Biden administration is suing Texas and destroying barriers at 
the border actively, every day. The taxpayers have already paid for the 
wall--the extension of the wall that was stopped after President Trump 
stepped down a few years ago. President Biden refuses to build a wall.
  He is pushing a bill on us that actually sets aside money it already 
appropriated for the wall and allows him to postpone new construction 
indefinitely. There is no plan. This is what they call a border bill. I 
call it a border giveaway.
  Joe Biden is selling off the border for pennies on the dollar that 
the taxpayers have already paid for. It is online. You can go online 
and buy, in an auction, the wall and razor wire that is sitting on the 
ground mostly in Arizona, and you can buy it for 10 cents on the 
dollar.
  He is actively destroying our southern border. This is something from 
the worst nightmares of our Founding Fathers: a President who is more 
concerned about other people's borders and not ours.
  Now, about half of the American southern border is also the southern 
border of Texas. There is an old saying that the Constitution is not a 
suicide pact. The Federal Government cannot--I repeat, cannot--force 
Texas to let itself be invaded and destroyed.
  Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution promises that the Federal 
Government shall protect every State from invasion. In fact, the 
Declaration of Independence accused King George of exposing the 
colonies ``to all the Dangers of Invasion.''
  Article I, section 10 of the Constitution explicitly says that a 
State may engage in war without the consent of Congress if ``actually 
invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.''
  Now, let's look at the facts. At least 10,000 people a day, on 
several months, have been coming across our border, averaging 7,500 a 
day. The Biden administration admits to releasing 85 percent of that 
7,500 a day into our country--85 percent are released into the country. 
This is in addition to the 2 million illegal immigrants that we have 
lost track of in the past 3 years.
  More than 100,000 Americans are dying every year because of drugs, 
which a lot have come across our southern border--and getting worse. 
That is more than we lost in the Vietnam war, and that was a very long 
war.

[[Page S413]]

  Drugs, gangs, and even terrorists are flooding--are flooding--our 
border. We don't know who they are. Can there be any doubt that the 
Founding Fathers would consider this an invasion?
  The population of our country at the founding was about 4 million 
people, at the beginning, 248 years ago. The population has grown, 
obviously. We have had more than 8 million illegal crossings since Joe 
Biden took office--8 million. The sheer scale of this is unlike 
anything that any of us have ever seen.
  So it should be clear. The facts and the Constitution are both on the 
State of Texas's side, and Texas has every right to protect the people 
in its State and our country.
  I am confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the Constitution on 
this ruling, but the real solution is not relying on a court ruling. 
The real solution is for President Joe Biden to stop destroying the 
border and put a stop to what is happening.
  Stop cutting the wire. Stop suing our border States. Stop selling off 
the wall. Stop pretending to want a border bill that we know won't 
work. Stop encouraging. Stop encouraging the invasion. He is personally 
doing that from the White House. Stop encouraging the invasion of our 
country, which is costing American lives every single day.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1199

  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, last week, the executives of some of the 
largest tech companies in the United States came before the U.S. 
Senate. And the world got to see, with all too vivid detail, just what 
these companies and these executives are doing to our children. And I 
say ``children'' advisedly. I am talking about 12- and 13- and 14- and 
15-year-old kids on these platforms--on Facebook, on Instagram, on 
SNAP--who are exposed to the most outrageous, unbelievable, grotesque, 
and vivid child sex abuse material known to mankind: images of 
exploitation, solicitations by pedophiles.
  It is unbelievable, indescribable material. And these platforms are 
absolutely awash with it. And we saw it last week. We heard the 
testimony. It was so bad that Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of 
Meta, actually felt forced to apologize to the parents there in the 
room and the parents across this country who have lost their children 
to suicide, whose children have suffered extraordinary harm because of 
the sex abuse material, the exploitative content that is all over Meta, 
that is all over these platforms.
  And oh, by the way, they are making an astounding profit. These 
companies are the most profitable companies in the world. They are the 
biggest companies in the history of the world. Facebook's share prices 
actually went up the day after Zuckerberg's testimony. It is 
unbelievable. Here they are making money hand over fist on destroying 
America's children.
  The numbers tell the tale. Think of this: In 2014, there were 1.1 
million reports of child sex abuse material online that year. That in 
itself is an incredible number--a million reports--but look at this: By 
2022, that number had risen to 32 million reports of child sex abuse 
material--child porn, child exploitation, solicitations. In just in 1 
year, there were 32 million reports. That is just the images that are 
actually being reported. Those are just the ones we know about. We know 
from the testimony of the tech executives, we know from the reporting 
of news agencies, we know from the investigations that have been done, 
we know from the parents, that these platforms are absolutely littered 
with, awash with, overrun with this material, and because of that, 
children are literally dying.
  Is it any coincidence that since the introduction of the smartphone 
and the ubiquity of these platforms in the hands of young people, that 
suicide rates and mental health crises have skyrocketed in this 
country?
  Oh, the platforms know, by the way. They absolutely know. A 
whistleblower testified before the U.S. Senate committee earlier this 
past year. He worked as a senior executive at Meta--that is Facebook. 
He knows Mark Zuckerberg personally. He was hired by Zuckerberg 
personally. He reported in part to Zuckerberg. Here is the thing, 
though: He had a teenage daughter. Yes, he had a teenage daughter who 
created an Instagram account, went online, and then told her father, 
this executive: Dad, you won't believe what I am seeing online. You 
won't believe what is happening to me online.
  So he looked into it, as any father would, and then he began to 
compile the data that he could find based on Instagram's own internal 
metrics, based on their user data and information. Here is a piece, 
just a piece, of what he found: that 37 percent of Instagram users 
between the ages of 13 and 15--let me say that again--37 percent of 
Instagram users between the ages of 13 and 15 had experienced unwanted 
nudity on the platform in the past 7 days.
  Let me just spell this out for you. It is largely, overwhelmingly 
young, teenage girls, young women, who are bombarded with--bombarded 
with--the most unbelievable pictures, content, conduct as soon as they 
get onto these platforms.
  Twenty-four percent of Instagram users between the ages of 13 and 15 
had received unwanted sexual advances in just the last 7 days, had been 
propositioned in 7 days.
  Seventeen percent of Instagram users in that same age range--young 
teenagers--had encountered self-harm content--how to commit suicide--
within the last 7 days.
  These are Instagram's own numbers. These were given to us by the 
whistleblower who, as an executive at Instagram, told Mark Zuckerberg 
about it. What did Mr. Zuckerberg do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
  Consider another case. Here is a picture of a young girl, 13 years 
old, named Issa. Issa doesn't actually exist. The New Mexico attorney 
general has launched an investigation into Meta--that is Facebook and 
Instagram--and their investigators created this profile.
  As you can see from the picture, she looks incredibly young. The 
profile picture information lists her as 13 years old. What happens as 
soon as she gets on the Meta platforms? As soon as she gets on the Meta 
platforms--this is all in court documents, by the way. Read it for 
yourself. It is horrifying. What happened was she was instantly added 
to a chat room with known pedophiles. What happened was her account was 
instantly bombarded with sexual material from older men. What happened 
was she was instantly sent multiple images of child sex abuse material 
over and over and over and over.
  Oh, and the tech executives--they know all about it, and they are not 
doing a thing about it. Why? Because they are not accountable.
  Here is the bottom line: This is the only industry in the country 
that can make a product that will literally kill you, and if it does, 
you can't do anything about it. If it kills your child, you can't do 
anything about it. If it harms you, you can't do anything about it. 
Think about this for a second. In this country, if a Coca-Cola 
manufacturer makes a bottle that explodes in your hands, you can sue 
them. If the drug company makes drugs that are full of adulterated 
products that cause harms that are not disclosed that kill people, you 
can sue them. If an automobile company makes cars that explode, you can 
sue them. Not these companies. No, not these companies. These companies 
have a special immunity from suit. How do they get that? Why, it was 
given to them. By whom? By this body. This body, almost 30 years ago, 
gave these powerful corporations total blanket immunity. They cannot be 
held responsible. They make products that kill; they cannot be held 
responsible.
  That is why we are here today. The Senate Judiciary Committee has 
heard testimony over and over again. We have written bills. We marked 
them up.
  The bill that I want the Senate to address today is one that has 
passed the Senate Judiciary Committee--get this--unanimously. 
Unanimously. Every Democrat. Every Republican. What does it do? Simple: 
It allows victims to have their day in court. It

[[Page S414]]

gives victims of these tech platforms the same right that victims of 
some car company or drug manufacturer or other product maker would 
have: the right to get into court; the basic American right to be 
heard; the right to hold accountable the most powerful corporations in 
the history of this Nation. That is what this bill does. I am proud to 
cosponsor it. I am proud that it received unanimous support in the 
committee.

  Mr. President, I will just say this: We have had hearings and 
hearings and hearings. We have had talks until there is no more talk to 
be done. It is time for Congress to act.
  Mr. Zuckerberg's apology is nice, but that is not going to help the 
victims of child sex abuse. What will help the victims of child sex 
abuse is the right to hold these companies accountable.
  It is time for Congress to act because, let's be honest, Congress 
helped create the problem. Do you want to know why there is sex abuse 
content overwhelming the internet? Because Congress enabled it. 
Congress did. Congress did. And the refusal now to allow victims to 
have their basic rights in court is allowing that child sex 
exploitation to continue and continue and continue. It is time to break 
the cycle.
  After Zuckerberg and the others came before the committee, after they 
apologized, I said now it is time for Congress to act. Let's take the 
work we have done, and let's put it on the floor. Let's act. Let's see 
where we are. Let's do something for victims. Let's right the wrongs 
that this body has helped create, and let's give victims the right to 
be heard.
  Mr. President, as if in legislative session and notwithstanding rule 
XXII, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 69, S. 1199; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I very much share the stated goals of the 
STOP CSAM Act. Child sexual abuse material is a toxic plague on the 
internet. There are real victims who need real support and criminals 
who must be hunted down and locked up.
  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to helping kids and 
punishing predators. However, this bill would weaken the single 
strongest technology that now protects children and families--that's 
strong encryption. It will make it easier to punish sites that use 
encryption to secure private conversations and personal devices. While 
STOP CSAM's sponsors have argued that the bill does not target 
encryption, the bill explicitly allows courts to punish companies that 
offer strong encryption. It also would encourage scanning of content on 
user's phones or computers before information is sent over the 
internet, which has the same consequences as breaking encryption.
  Weakening encryption is probably the single biggest gift that you can 
give to the predators and the monsters who want to stalk and spy on 
kids. Sexual predators will have a far easier time stealing and 
extorting photographs of children, tracking their phones, and spying on 
their private messages once encryption is breached.
  Doing so threatens the privacy and security of every single law-
abiding American.
  I also think it is surprising that the Senator is asking to pass this 
bill at the very same time its sponsor is reportedly circulating an 
updated version of the bill with a number of changes. Although that new 
version of the legislation has not been made public, it certainly would 
be a mistake to pass legislation that apparently is still in the 
process of being revised.
  Mr. President, what this is all about is talking about doing 
something effective or actually taking effective action. I have 
proposed doing just that. We ought to focus on giving law enforcement 
officials the tools they need to find and prosecute criminals 
responsible for exploiting kids and spreading these vile materials 
online. That way, we can help keep kids from becoming victims in the 
first place.
  Let me also say that we can do this if Members support my bipartisan 
Invest in Child Safety Act. The bill directs $5 billion in mandatory 
funding to do three things which would ensure that we have an effective 
response for families and parents: one, give law enforcement agencies 
the tools and personnel they need to catch the predators who are 
creating and spreading CSAM; two, fund community-based programs to 
prevent at-risk kids from becoming victims in the first place; three, 
invest in programs to support survivors of abuse.
  Any legislation that doesn't include these pieces is missing the 
point; therefore, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Missouri.
  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, there you have it. There are the Big Tech 
talking points. The problem is that they are entirely false. I have the 
bill text in front of me--the bill text that, again, passed unanimously 
out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--that explicitly exempts 
encryption technology: page 184, lines 15 and following; page 185, 
lines 1 through 18. You can read it for yourself--explicitly exempts. 
That is not true at all. It is flatly false.
  I have been on this floor over and over and over again on this issue, 
and every time, we are told: Not today. Not this. A little more of 
that. Maybe if it were more bipartisan.
  This has unanimous support from the Judiciary Committee. Unanimous. 
Every Republican. Every Democrat.
  And we all know the truth here: that until victims can get into court 
and have the rights and dignity of every other American challenging any 
other company, this will not change.
  Congress created this problem. Congress created it by giving the most 
powerful companies in the world a sweetheart deal that they still have 
to this day.
  It is an easy choice: Are you with the corporations or are you with 
the American people? Are you with the big companies or are you with the 
child victims? That is the choice.
  I would just say to those who continue to support 230 with no 
exceptions, no exemptions, no reform, no recognition of the incredible 
danger it has unleashed for children, that they are on an island.
  This state of affairs cannot continue. It cannot continue to be that 
if Big Tech sells products that kill kids, they cannot be held 
responsible.
  It cannot continue to be that only these companies, the most powerful 
companies in the world, get a pass that nobody else gets, because 
nobody should get it.
  I am committed to coming to this floor and forcing votes as long as 
it takes--as long as it takes--until we get justice for victims, until 
they are heard, and until these companies are finally held accountable.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to briefly 
respond to what my colleague has just repeated.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. WYDEN. And then I would ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to 
speak in favor of a very talented jurist in Oregon, who will be voted 
on shortly.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, with respect to my response to our 
colleague from Missouri, let me be clear on a point that technologists 
are clear on. This bill would weaken the strongest technology that 
protects children and families online: strong encryption. And this bill 
explicitly allows courts to punish companies that offer strong 
encryption. That is right at the center of my objection.

                      Nomination of Amy M. Baggio

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm Amy 
M. Baggio to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.
  Judge Baggio received her B.A., cum laude, from Wake Forest 
University and her J.D. from Lewis & Clark Law School. After law 
school, she became a public defender in Portland, where she represented 
clients in State court.

[[Page S415]]

From 2002 to 2012, she served in the Office of the Federal Public 
Defender for the District of Oregon in Portland. She handled both 
trials and appeals in that role, representing her clients in Federal 
district court and before the Ninth Circuit. In 2012, Judge Baggio 
opened a solo practice in Portland, where she worked until 2019. During 
her time as a litigator, she tried 12 cases to verdict, including 8 
jury trials.
  In 2019, Judge Baggio was appointed to the Oregon State Circuit Court 
in Multnomah County by then-Governor Kate Brown. Judge Baggio was 
subsequently elected to the position in 2020. Over the past 5 years, 
she has handled civil, criminal, and family law matters, and she has 
presided over more than 40 trials.
  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Baggio ``well 
qualified'' to serve on the District of Oregon. She has deep ties to 
Oregon and enjoys the strong support of both of her home State 
Senators, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley. Her extensive litigation 
background and experience as a State court judge will serve her well on 
the Federal bench.
  When Senator Wyden introduced Judge Baggio at her confirmation 
hearing, he noted that she has never had a party before her file a 
request for a different judge, a testament to her fairness. I strongly 
support this nominee, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
her nomination.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to move now to my brief remarks 
with respect to our judge from Oregon. I come to the floor today to 
reiterate my strong support for Judge Amy Baggio's nomination to serve 
on the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.
  Judge Baggio has a proven track record as both a jurist and a 
litigator. She spent a decade as a public defender; and in her career 
on the bench, she has presided over hundreds of civil and criminal 
matters and handled 42 trials, half of which were jury trials.
  And I note, because Members have been asking with respect to her 
values in terms of prosecuting and dealing with cases and her attitude 
towards criminals, in one case the judge sentenced a man to many more 
years for first-degree sexual abuse than anyone had thought was even 
being discussed, certainly longer than was sought by defense counsel. 
So it is a testament to Judge Baggio's fairness and professionalism 
that during her career as a judge, she has never once had a party file 
a request for a different judge.
  In addition to being fair, she has consistently demonstrated an 
ability to make thoughtful decisions that protect communities and their 
values.
  I urge my colleagues--and I gather that we will be going to the vote 
now--to support a very dedicated public servant--and I emphasize that--
a public servant who has got a real track record as a public defender 
and in her career on the bench.
  I urge my colleagues to support Judge Amy Baggio.

                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in December, President Zelenskyy came 
here to Congress. He came to us because he is fighting for his 
country's future and for his citizens' lives. This supplemental 
spending bill, the portion for Ukraine, will fulfill our commitments to 
our allies, defend democracy, and save innocent lives.
  Let's be absolutely clear about that. Ukrainian civilians will live 
or die based on what we decide to do here in the Senate, in this 
Chamber. Are we going to ignore the requests, the pleas, the cries for 
help from our fellow champions of democracy in Ukraine?
  President Zelenskyy has told us that Ukrainians will continue to 
fight with or without us. By that, he did not mean that they don't need 
us. No, they need us more than ever. With our help, they have pushed 
back against the Russian invaders. Without our help, they will run out 
of ammunition to hold back the Russians.
  Our White House has conveyed this message:

       We are out of money--and nearly out of time.

  That is our government speaking. Our White House has warned us that 
``while our allies around the world have stepped up to do more, U.S. 
support is critical and cannot be replicated by others.''
  Putin himself told us the deadly stakes. He said:

       [Ukraine] will only have a week to live when the ammunition 
     runs out.

  And Ukrainians are running out of ammunition.
  Now, the United States could choose to stop funding, but the 
Ukrainians can't choose to stop fighting--nor would any of us if war 
came to our hometowns. If you had to defend your home, if you had to 
defend your family knowing that, if you stopped fighting, that death 
would fall from the sky as bombs and rockets obliterated your 
communities; that as Russian soldiers marched down your quiet street, 
your neighbors would be tortured, raped, your children stolen, your 
family executed, would you stop fighting even if you ran out of 
ammunition?
  And those actions are what Russia has already done in the cities and 
towns they ran over in Ukraine. We know it will continue to happen if 
they run over other cities.
  So the Ukrainian people really are fighting for their lives, and we 
are here debating whether we are going to abandon them. This is a 
conversation I can't believe we are having. I can't believe, with all 
of the foreign engagements we have been involved in, that when a fellow 
Republic which has repeatedly pushed hard to be out from under Russia's 
thumb, which had the Orange Revolution, which threw a President out of 
their country who wanted to betray them, who are now fighting in the 
streets against this Russian invasion--I can't believe we are having 
this conversation here in the Senate with so many colleagues ready to 
abandon Ukraine.
  But this is certainly a critical debate. Ukraine is not some regional 
conflict on a faraway map. Putin himself put it this way in October. He 
said:

       This is not a territorial conflict or even the 
     establishment of a regional geopolitical balance.

  He continued, and he said:

       The question is much broader and more fundamental: We are 
     talking about the principles on which the new world order 
     will be based.


[[Page S416]]


  That is Putin. And what are the principles that Putin champions in 
that new world order? Well, we know what they are: the end of freedom 
of speech; the end of freedom of assembly; the end of freedom of 
religion; the end of citizens, through the integrity of democratic 
elections, choosing their own leaders and their own futures.
  And there is another principle that is very much embedded with Putin, 
and that is the continuation of vile crimes against humanity--of rape, 
torture, and execution.
  And Putin is not the only authoritarian in the world with this set of 
principles. We have got the Ayatollah in Iran to Xi Jinping in China 
who share his vision, who have closed ranks behind him in this fight, 
this fight in which they evade sanctions, legitimize tyranny, undermine 
the precious values of human rights, freedom, and democracy.
  They are watching the United States very closely. They are watching 
to see if Senators in this Chamber are going to vote to abandon 
Ukraine. They are going to see if Senators in this Chamber are going to 
abandon our partnership and alliance with NATO in support of the people 
and the republic in Ukraine. They are watching to see if they can 
outlast our fickle political attention span. They are watching to see 
if they can invade their neighboring countries, execute the citizens in 
that country, and take over those adjacent nations, all for more power 
and more profit.
  It is so important that democracy stand shoulder to shoulder in this 
fight. We know that is what we need to do. That is how we won the Cold 
War. And before that, it is how we won World War II when we defeated 
another axis of authoritarians bent on repression and conquest.

  It was in 1940. Germany and Italy signed a pact to support each 
other. Back then, many Americans believed that we could stay out of war 
in Eastern Europe by hiding behind the slogan of ``America First.'' And 
then the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor.
  The war in Europe then, like the war in Europe today, isn't some 
regional conflict that we can ignore, not some regional conflict that 
doesn't affect us. It is a universal struggle about whether people in 
Ukraine and here in the United States have the right to live in freedom 
and peace or whether repressive authoritarians can conquer democracies.
  And the authoritarians in Europe and Asia then, like the 
authoritarians in Europe and Asia today, were dictators who viewed 
democracy as a threat--a threat to their power, a threat that must be 
destroyed. Dictators do not stop. Dictators must be stopped.
  Putin has ruled Russia for a quarter of a century, and he wants even 
more time to continue his establishment of those principles against 
freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, the 
principles of crushing dissent. Putin has ruled with total and 
merciless control and power, and he wants even more power. What makes 
us think that ceding some of Ukraine will be enough to placate him?
  We have seen this story before. The last time the world naively tried 
to placate a murderous madman was when British Prime Minister Neville 
Chamberlain went to Munich in 1938. In Munich, Chamberlain told Hitler, 
like some colleagues in this Chamber today want to say to Putin, that 
he could have a slice of an adjacent country--in that case, 
Czechoslovakia--and England would look the other way and declare 
``peace in our time.'' But that appeasement of Hitler didn't produce 
``peace in our time.'' Instead, that appeasement encouraged his 
appetite, made him stronger, set the stage for the unimaginable horrors 
of World War II.
  Appeasing Putin today is as wrong strategically and morally as 
appeasing Hitler was 86 years ago. Think of the lives we could have 
saved and the incalculable destruction we could have prevented had we 
stopped Hitler in 1938.
  Well, we have that same question before us right now. Every student 
of history, every student of politics, if they could go back in time, 
would tell Chamberlain: Do not appease Hitler. That will not work.
  For the same reason, every student of history and politics today is 
telling us: Don't appease Putin.
  Appeasing Putin would be a mistake of the same magnitude, one that 
future historians will condemn as the mega-mistake of the 21st century.
  We must say here in this Chamber--we must say no to another Munich 
moment. We must say no to appeasement. We must say no to the Neville 
Chamberlains of our time.
  Some of my colleagues asked the question: Can we afford to defend 
democracy?
  Munich and Pearl Harbor teach us we cannot afford not to defend 
democracy. A threat to democracy anywhere is a threat to democracy 
everywhere.
  Experts estimate that Putin is spending some 30 percent, and possibly 
quite more, of his government budget to fight this war. We here in the 
United States, we are spending 1.5 percent of our government budget to 
support Ukraine. That is pennies on the dollar. A penny and a half of 
our Federal budget, that is all we are asking.
  The Ukrainians are fighting and giving with their lives and their 
injuries to save their democracy. All they are asking of us: 1.5 
percent of our Federal budget.
  We are not putting Americans in harm's way in the process. We are 
just being asked for 1.5 percent of our government budget. But that 1.5 
percent, that is so important. It is that 1.5 percent combined with the 
European partnership that is supporting the people in Ukraine. It is 
those pennies, that 1.5 percent, that is ensuring that Ukrainian 
soldiers don't run out of artillery shells. It is those pennies, that 
1.5 percent, so that Ukrainian soldiers won't run out of air defenses. 
It is those pennies that will ensure Ukrainian soldiers will not run 
out of ammunition.
  If Putin conquers Ukraine like Hitler conquered Czechoslovakia, if he 
sees the United States will not stand with this democratic ally, where 
will his attention turn next? Where will his attention turn to his next 
project? He is a frustrated KGB agent who saw the dissolution of the 
USSR, the Soviet Union, as the biggest calamity of his life, and he 
wants to do everything in his power to take back as much as he possibly 
can in his lifetime. That is his mission.
  So anyone who thinks you can appease Putin the way Chamberlain tried 
to appease Hitler, you are just wrong. Imagine the costs when Russian 
tanks roll up to the border of Poland or Estonia or Latvia or Finland. 
All NATO members are sworn by a treaty to defend each other, and that 
includes not just our money but our soldiers.
  It makes so much sense to stand with Ukraine today and stop Putin in 
Ukraine rather than to hand over Ukraine and then defend the rest of 
Europe from his aggression that will surely follow.
  And think about the message that we are sending to China regarding 
Taiwan. China is watching this very closely. China says: If Putin can 
outlast the United States and Europe in Ukraine, well, we can certainly 
outlast them when we attack Taiwan.
  So standing with Ukraine today is the right stance if you want to 
deter China from attacking Taiwan tomorrow. We could have stopped 
Hitler in 1938, just like we can stop Putin today.
  This is a war between democracy and authoritarianism, and this Senate 
floor, the battlefield, is right here, right now, this week. The 
decisions that we make this week about funding Ukraine may be the most 
consequential of our careers. The United States, in this fight, is the 
only truly indispensable nation.
  If we are leaders of the free world, if we are the last best hope for 
democracy, then we have to actually be that hope for democracy. We have 
to heed the lessons of history. We have to stop dictators like Putin in 
their tracks, and we need to do it now.
  When President Zelenskyy was here before Congress in 2022, he said:

       This struggle will define in what world our children and 
     grandchildren will live, and then their children and 
     grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy 
     of Ukrainians and for Americans--for all.
  He continued:

       This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be 
     ignored.

  My friends, defending Ukraine is not some charitable operation where 
we can decide to give a little more or a little less and feel good 
about it. Defending Ukraine is global and national security.

[[Page S417]]

  Putin and his authoritarian allies want to show the world that 
democracies don't work. We here in the U.S. Senate, need to show the 
world that democracies do work. The Senate should debate the 
supplemental security spending for Ukraine this week in this Chamber; 
the Senate should vote on this supplemental security for Ukraine this 
week in this Chamber; and this Senate should pass this emergency 
funding supplemental for Ukraine here in this Chamber this week for 
Ukraine's democracy and for our own.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kelly). The Senator from Oregon.

                       REMEMBERING JEAN CARNAHAN

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn last week of the 
passing of a trailblazing former member of our Senate family. Senator 
Jean Carnahan was the first woman ever to represent Missouri in the 
U.S. Senate.
  She was appointed to the Senate in December 2000, after her husband, 
then-Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, lost his life in an airplane crash 
in the closing weeks of his Senate campaign. The Carnahans' eldest son 
Randy and Chris Sifford, a longtime political aide to the Governor, 
also perished in the plane crash.
  It was too late to remove Governor Carnahan's name from the ballot so 
1 week before the election, Missouri's acting Governor announced that 
he would appoint Jean Carnahan to serve in her late husband's place 
should the people of Missouri elect Governor Carnahan posthumously.
  In her first remarks in the Senate, Senator Carnahan told her new 
colleagues, ``I know I did not come to the U.S. Senate in the same way 
you did. I did not have a long-term, personal commitment to a campaign. 
My name has never been on a ballot. On election night there was no 
victory celebration. You are here because of your win; I am here 
because of my loss. But we are all here to do the work of this great 
nation.''
  The first Senator to greet her after she took her oath of office was 
someone who also knew the searing pain of losing a spouse and child. As 
Senator Carnahan later recalled, then-Senator Joe Biden assured 
Missouri's new Senator that she could endure her crushing loss. He also 
shared with her the same advice that had been given to him when he was 
elected to the Senate shortly after his wife Neilia and baby daughter 
Naomi were killed in a car crash.
  His advice was, ``Lose yourself in the work.'' In fact, as President 
Biden remarked last week after Senator Carnahan died, ``she found 
herself'' serving the people of her State in this Senate.
  She was elected as a Member of the first 50/50, evenly divided 
Senate. The 2 years she served were some of the most tragic and 
turbulent in our Nation's history. They included the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks on America, the start of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and 
the anthrax attack on the Senate.
  In a time of growing political division and acrimony, Senator 
Carnahan was a quiet but determined consensus seeker and a practical 
politician. She joined the Centrist Coalition, a bipartisan group of 
Senators. She focused on national security, conditions for members of 
the military, and military families. And she was part of the first 
congressional delegation to Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks.
  While she had never held public office before, Jean Carnahan was not 
new to politics and public service; she had been serving the people of 
Missouri her entire adult life. She was born Jean Carpenter and grew up 
in a working-class section of Washington, DC. Her father was a plumber, 
and her mother was a hairdresser. She met her future husband, the son 
of a Missouri Congressman, when they were both 15 years old. They met 
first at church and a few days later at Anacostia High School, where 
they were seated next to each other.
  On their second date, he told her that he was going to marry her, and 
he was going to move back to Missouri to run for Congress. They married 
5 years later. The following year, Jean Carnahan graduated from George 
Washington University with a degree in business and public 
administration, the first member of her family to graduate from high 
school or college.
  True to his word, Mel Carnahan returned to Missouri and was elected 
to Congress, representing the Bootheel area of southeastern Missouri. 
He would go on to serve two terms as a popular Missouri Governor.
  In their early campaigns, Jean Carnahan was her husband's 
speechwriter and press secretary, and she was always his best and 
closest political confidante. She made the position of first lady of 
Missouri a full-time job and developed her own slate of child- and 
family-centered causes. She advocated successfully for establishing 
daycare centers at workplaces. Her focus on childhood immunizations 
helped boost Missouri's childhood immunization rate from 49th in the 
Nation to tenth. She also led a successful effort to renovate 
Missouri's Governor's mansion. She also was a gifted writer, author of 
seven books.
  Weeks before the end of her time in the Senate, in another cruel 
twist of fate, a different plane crash claimed the lives of another 
beloved member of this Senate, Senator Paul Wellstone, along with his 
wife Sheila, their daughter Marcia, three campaign staffers, and the 
plane's two pilots. In the dark days that followed, no one was a 
greater support to the devastated Wellstone staff than Senator Carnahan 
and her staff.
  In 2002, Senator Carnahan ran in a special election to serve the 
remainder of what would have been her husband's 6-year term. She lost 
in a razor-thin vote.
  In her final remarks on this floor, she thanked the people of 
Missouri for allowing three generations of Carnahans to serve their 
State. She also had some wise words of advice to the Senators that 
served with her and those who would follow her. I think her parting 
words are even more important today.
  Senator Carnahan implored us ``[W]hen my colleagues think on the role 
of government, seek a balance. Seek a balance between one that does 
everything and one that does nothing. And where there is talk of war, 
let there be the free and open debate that becomes our great Nation. 
And when there are judges to be appointed, let them be selected for 
their temperament and jurisprudence and not for political ideology that 
satisfies a special interest group.''
  She continued ``When we lay out our energy and environment policy, 
let it not be for short-term gain but for the well-being of our 
grandchildren and the survival of our planet. And when my colleagues 
speak of leaving no child behind, let that not be a mantra but a

[[Page S418]]

mission, fervent and funded. When health care is thought about, the 
health care needs of children, family, and seniors--and I hope that 
will be often--I urge my colleagues to lay aside partisanship and heed 
the plight of the hurting and the helpless in our society.''
  We would all do well to heed her thoughtful counsel.
  Loretta and I offer our sincere condolences to all those who are 
mourning her passing and especially to her family: her daughter Robin, 
Missouri's former secretary of state and the current head of the 
Federal General Services Administration, her sons Tom and Russ, a 
former Missouri Congressman, and her five grandchildren.
  Senator Jean Carnahan was an immensely strong and brave woman who 
made history and made this Senate, our Nation, and her beloved State of 
Missouri better. She will be missed.

                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

                   The Netherlands--Hellfire Missiles

       The Government of the Netherlands has requested to buy up 
     to three hundred eighty-six (386) Hellfire Air-to-Ground 
     Missiles, AGM-114R2. Also included is U.S. Army Aviation and 
     Missile Command (AMCOM) Security Assistance Management 
     Directorate (SAMD) technical assistance; Tactical Aviation 
     and Ground Munitions (TAGM) Project Office technical 
     assistance; non-standard books, publications, and other 
     Hellfire publications; integration support; and other related 
     elements of logistics and program support. The estimated 
     total cost is $150 million.
       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals 
     and national security objectives of the United States by 
     improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for 
     political stability and economic progress in Europe.
       The proposed sale will improve the Netherlands' capability 
     to strengthen its homeland defense and deter regional 
     threats. This will contribute to its military goals of 
     updating capability while further enhancing interoperability 
     with the United States and other allies. The Netherlands will 
     have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed 
     forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin 
     Corporation in Orlando, FL. The purchaser typically requests 
     offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations 
     between the purchaser and the contractor(s).
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S. 
     Government or contractor representatives to travel to the 
     Netherlands for program management reviews to support the 
     program.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AGM-114R2 Hellfire Missile is used against heavy and 
     light armored targets, thin skinned vehicles, urban 
     structures, bunkers, caves, and personnel. The missile is 
     Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based, with a variable delay 
     fuse, and improved safety and reliability.
       2. The highest level of classification of defense articles, 
     components, and services included in this potential sale is 
     SECRET.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures that

                          policy justification

 The Netherlands--Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles with Extended 
                                 Range

       The Government of the Netherlands has requested to buy one 
     hundred twenty (120) AGM-158B/B-2 Joint Air-to-Surface 
     Standoff Missiles with Extended Range (JASSM-ER) All-Up-
     Rounds; fifteen (15) AGM-158 Inert JASSMs with Test 
     Instrumentation Kits; two (2) AGM-158 JASSM Separation Test 
     Vehicles; one (1) AGM-158 Instrumented Test Vehicle; and two 
     (2) JASSM Jettison Test Vehicles. Also included are AGM-158 
     JASSM Dummy Air Training Missiles (DATM) and containers; KGV-
     135A encryption devices; test and integration equipment and 
     support; spare parts, consumables, accessories, and repair 
     and return support; munitions support and support equipment; 
     classified and unclassified publications and technical 
     documentation; Contractor Logistics Support (CLS); 
     transportation support; personnel training and training 
     equipment; studies and surveys; U.S. Government and 
     contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support 
     services; and other related elements of logistics and program 
     support. The estimated total cost is $908 million.
       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals 
     and national security objectives of the United States by 
     improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for 
     political stability and economic progress in Europe.
       The proposed sale will improve the Netherlands' capability 
     to meet current and future threats by increasing its 
     airborne, long-range, precision-strike combat capability. The 
     Netherlands will use these systems to defend NATO Allies and 
     deter aggression. The Netherlands will have no difficulty 
     absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Missiles 
     and Fire Control, Orlando, FL. The purchaser typically 
     requests offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in 
     negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to the Netherlands.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile with 
     Extended Range (JASSM-ER) All-Up-Round is a low-observable, 
     highly-survivable, subsonic cruise missile designed to 
     penetrate next-generation air defense systems enroute to 
     target. The JASSM-ER is designed to kill hard, medium-
     hardened, soft, and area type targets. The extended range 
     over the baseline was obtained by going from a turbo jet to a 
     turbo-fan engine and by reconfiguring the fuel tanks for 
     added capacity.
       The AGM-158B-2 system capabilities include all the 
     capabilities of the AGM-158B. The AGM-158B-2 configuration 
     will have different internal components to address multiple 
     obsolescence issues as well as subcomponent updates to 
     position for M-Code and other potential upgrades.
       2. The KGV-135A is a high-speed, general purpose encryptor/
     decryptor module used for wide-band data encryption.
       3. The highest level of classification of defense articles, 
     components, and services included in this potential sale is

                         TRIBUTE TO RICK FUSON

  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rick Fuson, who 
is retiring after 40 years of devoted work for the Indiana Pacers.
  Rick Fuson is a lifelong Hoosier. He was born in Indianapolis and 
attended Indiana University, where he played football and earned his 
degree in political science. Rick began working for the Pacers 
organization in 1984 as director of special events, and he rose 
steadily through the ranks. He was promoted to executive senior vice 
president of Pacers Sports and Entertainment in 2001, chief operating 
officer in 2008, and president and CEO in 2014.
  During his 40 years with the Pacers, Rick has played a vital role not 
just in reshaping the Pacers organization, but in revitalizing downtown 
Indianapolis. He helped oversee the construction of a new arena, now 
known as Gainbridge Fieldhouse. And he promoted it not only as the home 
of the Indiana Pacers, but as a multipurpose venue that could bring 
considerable economic opportunities to the Hoosier State.
  His roles as a longtime executive board member of the Indianapolis 
Chamber of Commerce, Visit Indy, the Downtown Indy, Inc., and many 
other organizations have put him at the center of the capital city's 
evolution into a global center for live sports and entertainment, arts 
and culture, and business.
  In retirement, Rick and his wife Karen hope to spend more time with 
their children and grandchildren. It is my honor to thank Mr. Fuson for 
his tireless devotion to the Indiana Pacers and the city of 
Indianapolis.

                       REMEMBERING RAYMOND JACOBY

  Mr. WELCH. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the recent 
passing, and honor the life of an extraordinary Vermonter, Raymond 
``Ray'' Bradley Jacoby. Ray touched the lives of many in our State, and 
his presence in his community will be deeply missed.
  Ray dedicated much of his professional career to volunteerism and 
nonprofit service. Ray was the executive director of the Chittenden 
County United Way in Burlington, VT, for 10 years in the 1970s and 80s. 
In this role, he worked to make financial stability, healthcare, and 
affordable education accessible to everyone, coordinating with 
community partners to provide crucial assistance to Chittenden County 
residents.
  Throughout his life, Ray was also a devoted attendee, employee, and 
supporter of YMCA summer camps. As a young boy, he attended YMCA camps 
across New England. Later in his life, he served in nearly every camp 
position, from counselor-in-training to camp director. After his 
retirement from the United Way, he worked with YMCA Camp Abnaki in 
North Hero, VT, for years. He helped the camp to raise funds and 
provide support to the staff to ensure campers had the best experience 
possible every summer.
  Ray will be remembered by many for his contributions to his 
community, commitment to his work, and devotion to his family. It is 
with both great sadness and honor that I celebrate the life of Raymond 
Jacoby and extend my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. 
His impact on Vermonters will never be forgotten.

              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY

<bullet> Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize 
Northeastern University, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary.
  Northeastern University began as the Boston YMCA Evening Institute 
for Young Men in 1898, established to meet the industry's emergent need 
for skilled workers in the vocational trades. Today, Northeastern is a 
global research university and a recognized leader in experiential 
lifelong learning that integrates real-world experience with education, 
research, and innovation. Launched over a century ago, Northeastern's 
signature cooperative education--co-op--model now spans every continent 
and more than 3,500 employer partners where students work, study, and 
research.
  With an R1 Carnegie classification, the university's research 
enterprise, focused broadly on the domains of health, security, and 
sustainability, as well as cutting-edge fields like artificial 
intelligence and robotics, wireless technology, and the life sciences, 
has quintupled during the past 15 years and pushed the bounds of 
scientific discovery. Since 2011, Northeastern has embarked on an 
ambitious expansion across the United States, Canada, and the United 
Kingdom. Today, Northeastern's global university system comprises 13 
sites, making it the only U.S. research university with comprehensive 
campuses on both coasts and a leader in preparing graduates with global 
experience.
  The university's success extends beyond learning and discovery to 
intercollegiate athletics, as reflected, most recently, by the Huskies' 
sweep of the 2023 men's and women's Beanpot ice hockey tournaments for 
a record sixth time.
  Northeastern counts a long and proud tradition of partnership with 
the Nation's armed forces that includes a U.S. Army Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps--ROTC--unit, extensive collaboration in defense and 
homeland security research, and a nationally recognized student 
veterans organization dedicated to helping returning veterans 
transition to higher education and achieve professional career success.
  On the 125th anniversary of its founding, the university's 
investments in entrepreneurship, women's empowerment, civic engagement, 
public art, and sustainability have made an extraordinary contribution 
to the economic and social fabric of the city of Boston, the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the United States, and the world. They 
are a credit to the nearly 300,000 Northeastern alums living, working, 
and making a difference in communities around the globe.
  On the occasion of this milestone, I am proud to recognize 
Northeastern University.<bullet>

           RECOGNIZING THE NEW BERN AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

<bullet> Mr. BUDD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the New 
Bern Area Chamber of Commerce on its 125th anniversary.
  Since its founding in 1899, the New Bern Area Chamber of Commerce has 
played a vital role in promoting small businesses, tourism, and all 
that New Bern has to offer.
  New Bern has a rich history as North Carolina's second oldest town. 
It once served as the first capital of our great state. New Bern is 
also widely known as the birthplace of Pepsi-Cola. The community boasts 
a thriving downtown with vibrant restaurants and small businesses. It 
is a true gem in Eastern North Carolina thanks to the continual efforts 
of organizations like the New Bern Area Chamber of Commerce.
  As a small business owner and member of the United States Senate 
Committee on Small Business, I know that chambers of commerce are one 
of the greatest assets to smaller towns and rural communities. I 
appreciate the efforts that President & CEO Kevin Roberts and his 
entire team make daily to help ensure New Bern continues to thrive.
  Mr. President, please join me in congratulating the New Bern Area 
Chamber on their 125th anniversary. I can say with certainty that this 
organization will remain a pillar in the community for decades to 
come.<bullet>

                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 543--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF STATE GOVERNORS TO REPEL THE DANGEROUS ONGOING 
           INVASION ACROSS THE UNITED STATES SOUTHERN BORDER

  Mr. MARSHALL submitted the following resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 543

       Whereas during a 2019 Democratic presidential primary 
     debate, President Biden called for ``all those people seeking 
     asylum'' to ``immediately surge to the border'';
       Whereas during a 2019 Democratic presidential primary 
     debate, President Biden raised his hand when candidates were 
     asked if their health plans will provide coverage for illegal 
     immigrants;
       Whereas during a 2020 Democratic presidential primary 
     debate, President Biden pledged support for ``sanctuary 
     cities'' when he stated that illegal immigrants arrested by 
     local police should not be turned over to Federal immigration 
     authorities;
       Whereas on January 20, 2021, one of President Biden's first 
     actions as President was sending proposed legislation, the 
     U.S. Citizenship Act, to Congress, which would provide a path 
     to citizenship for an estimated 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 
     illegal immigrants who are currently residing in the United 
     States;
       Whereas, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued a 
     ``Proclamation on the Termination Of Emergency With Respect 
     To The Southern Border Of The United States And Redirection 
     Of Funds Diverted To Border Wall Construction'', which halted 
     construction of physical barriers along the international 
     border between the United States and Mexico;
       Whereas President Biden later terminated existing border 
     wall construction contracts and failed to obligate more than 
     $1,000,000,000 that Congress had lawfully appropriated for 
     border wall construction;
       Whereas on January 20, 2021, President Biden halted 
     enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols policy, which 
     is commonly known as the ``Remain in Mexico'' program;
       Whereas on February 6, 2021, Secretary of State Antony 
     Blinken suspended and terminated the asylum cooperative 
     agreements with the Governments of El Salvador, of Guatemala, 
     and of Honduras;
       Whereas in March 2022, the Department of Homeland Security 
     began implementing the interim final rule titled ``Procedures 
     for Credible Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, 
     Withholding of Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum 
     Officers'' which authorizes U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
     Services to consider the asylum applications of individuals 
     subject to expedited removal and violates the law enacted by 
     Congress that requires asylum seekers to offer evidence to 
     persuade a judge in an immigration court;
       Whereas in August 2022, the Department of Homeland Security 
     terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols (commonly known 
     as the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy), which required aliens 
     with pending asylum claims to wait in Mexico;
       Whereas, during fiscal year 2023, U.S. Immigration and 
     Customs Enforcement executed 142,580 removals, which is 
     significantly lower than the 226,000 to 410,000 removals that 
     occurred every fiscal year between fiscal years 2008 through 
     2020;
       Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Immigration and 
     Customs Enforcement--
       (1) arrested 48 percent fewer convicted criminals than had 
     been arrested during the prior fiscal year;
       (2) deported 63 percent fewer criminals than had been 
     deported in the prior fiscal year; and
       (3) issued 56 percent fewer ``detainer requests'' to local 
     authorities than had been issued in the prior fiscal year;
       Whereas, during fiscal year 2023, U.S. Immigration and 
     Customs Enforcement arrested 74,000 aliens with pending 
     charges or convictions, which is fewer than the more than 
     138,000 arrests of such aliens during fiscal year 2018;
       Whereas, during fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border 
     Protection made more than 2,400,000 apprehensions of illegal 
     immigrants along the international border between the United 
     States and Mexico, which is the highest level ever recorded;
       Whereas, on April 1, 2022, President Biden announced the 
     termination of a public health policy used to expel 
     potentially infected illegal immigrants during the COVID-19 
     pandemic (commonly known as the ``title 42 policy'');
       Whereas, on September 30, 2021, the Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, issued a memorandum titled 
     ``Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law'', 
     which stated that an alien's illegal status in the United 
     States should not be the sole basis of an enforcement action 
     and prioritized for apprehension and removal aliens who are a 
     threat to national security, public safety, or border 
     security;
       Whereas, on October 12, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued a 
     memorandum titled ``Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to 
     Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the 
     American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual'', which 
     included Department-wide guidance to cease mass worksite 
     operations, among other instructions;
       Whereas, on October 27, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued a 
     memorandum titled ``Guidelines for Enforcement Actions in or 
     Near Protected Areas'', which listed numerous protected areas 
     where the enforcement of Federal immigration law should not 
     occur;
       Whereas, in December 2023, U.S. Customs and Border 
     Protection encountered 302,034 illegal immigrants along the 
     international border between the United States and Mexico, 
     which is the highest number of such encounters ever recorded 
     in a single month;
       Whereas President Biden's fiscal year 2023 budget request 
     aims to shift the Department of Homeland Security's border 
     management away from enforcement and toward ``effectively 
     managing irregular migration along the Southwest border'';
       Whereas in November 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott--
       (1) declared a state of invasion at the southern border; 
     and
       (2) increased security at the border to protect the state 
     of Texas by invoking--
          (A) section 10 of Article I of the Constitution of the 
     United States; and
          (B) the invasion clauses in the Texas Constitution;
       Whereas in March 2023, at a hearing of the Committee on 
     Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, U.S. 
     Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz told lawmakers that the 
     Department of Homeland Security did not have operational 
     control of the border;
       Whereas in March 2023, at a hearing of the Committee on the 
     Judiciary of the Senate, Secretary of Homeland Security 
     Alejandro Mayorkas stated that he does not use the statutory 
     definition of operational control under section 2(b) of the 
     Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367; 8 U.S.C. 1701 
     note) when asked if the Department of Homeland Security had 
     operational control of the border;
       Whereas on January 6, 2023, the Biden Administration abused 
     its parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the 
     Immigration Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) to create a 
     new parole program for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, 
     and Venezuela;
       Whereas on April 27, 2023, the Biden Administration further 
     abused its parole authority by creating a new family 
     reunification parole process, which grants parole to entire 
     categories of aliens rather than granting parole on a case-
     by-case basis, as required under such section 212(d)(5);
       Whereas the Biden Administration created a parole with 
     conditions policy authorizing U.S. Border Patrol agents to 
     release aliens through parole before they are given a Notice 
     to Appear or entered into removal proceedings;
       Whereas the Biden Administration has expanded the use of 
     the CBP One app, allowing tens of thousands of aliens to 
     enter the United States unlawfully to hide the mass 
     immigration surge following the termination of the order of 
     suspension issued by the Director of the Centers for Disease 
     Control and Prevention under section 362 of the Public Health 
     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265) as a result of the public health 
     emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (commonly known 
     as the ``title 42 order'');
       Whereas drug cartels are receiving an estimated 
     $13,000,000,000 each year from their human smuggling 
     operations across the southern border of the United States, 
     which represents an enormous increase from the estimated 
     $500,000,000 the drug cartels received in 2018 from such 
     operations;
       Whereas during fiscal year 2023, according to the non-
     detained docket, an estimated 6,200,000 illegal aliens were 
     at large in the United States, including more than 400,000 
     known criminal aliens;

[[Page S425]]

       Whereas the estimated fiscal burden of illegal immigration 
     on taxpayers in fiscal year 2023 is estimated to be 
     $150,700,000,000, which is a massive increase from the 
     estimated fiscal burden of $116,000,000,000 during fiscal 
     year 2017.
       Whereas tax payments from illegal aliens are equal to 
     approximately \1/6\ of the costs incurred by government 
     entities in the United States on their behalf;
       Whereas during fiscal year 2022, total Federal justice 
     enforcement expenditures as a result of illegal immigration 
     were $25,100,000,000 and total Federal welfare program 
     expenditures for illegal aliens were $11,600,000,000;
       Whereas in April 2023, the Biden Administration proposed a 
     plan to expand healthcare access for aliens granted deferred 
     action pursuant to the final rule submitted by the Department 
     of Homeland Security titled ``Deferred Action for Childhood 
     Arrivals'' (87 Fed. Reg. 53152 (August 30, 2022)), further 
     encouraging illegal aliens to enter the United States;
       Whereas on May 3 2023, the Office of the Inspector General 
     of the Department of Homeland Security issued a report titled 
     ``Intensifying Conditions at the Southwest Border Are 
     Negatively Impacting CBP and ICE Employees' Health and 
     Morale'';
       Whereas in June 2023, the Committee on Homeland Security of 
     the House of Representatives opened an investigation into 
     Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas for dereliction of 
     duty;
       Whereas in June 2023, an estimated 16,800,000 illegal 
     aliens resided in the United States, which represents an 
     increase of an estimated 16 percent during the first 2 years 
     of the Biden presidency;
       Whereas on June 30, 2023, U.S. Customs and Border 
     Protection announced the expansion of available CBP One 
     appointments to 1,450 per day;
       Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended 
     illegal immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, 
     Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti, Brazil, other Central and Latin 
     American nations, Turkey, India, Russia, and other nations 
     outside of the Western Hemisphere;
       Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended 
     169 people during fiscal year 2023 along the international 
     border between the United States and Mexico who are listed on 
     the Federal Bureau of Investigations' terrorist screening 
     database;
       Whereas, U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested more 
     than 15,627 illegal aliens during fiscal year 2023 who have 
     been convicted of 1 or more crimes in the United States or 
     abroad, including--
       (1) 284 convicted sexual criminals;
       (2) 29 who were convicted of homicide or manslaughter;
       (3) 307 who were convicted of illegal weapons possession, 
     transport, or trafficking;
       (4) 864 who were convicted of burglary, robbery, larceny, 
     theft, or fraud; and
       (5) 1,254 who were convicted of assault, battery, or 
     domestic violence;
       Whereas, during fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border 
     Protection seized--
       (1) 27,000 pounds of fentanyl;
       (2) 1,500 pounds of heroin;
       (3) 1,000 pounds of methamphetamine;
       (4) 81,100 pounds of cocaine; and
       (5) 7,800 pounds of ketamine;
       Whereas, provisional data from the National Center for 
     Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention estimates that there were 107,622 drug overdose 
     deaths in the United States during 2021, an increase of 
     nearly 15 percent from the estimated 93,655 deaths in 2020, 
     with overdose deaths involving opioids increasing from an 
     estimated 70,029 in 2020 to an estimated 80,816 in 2021, and 
     overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl), 
     psychostimulants (such as methamphetamine), and cocaine also 
     increasing during 2021.
       Whereas clause 1 of section 10 of article I of the United 
     States Constitution states, in part, ``No State shall, 
     without the Consent of Congress . . . engage in War, unless 
     actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not 
     admit of delay.'';
       Whereas section 4 of article IV of the United States 
     Constitution states, in part, ``The United States shall 
     guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of 
     Government, and shall protect each of them against 
     Invasion'';
       Whereas, in the context of known security concerns due to a 
     lack of proper vetting processes and systems, and in 
     conjunction with how the mass unlawful movement of people 
     across the border of the United States directly empowers and 
     enriches cartels and transnational gangs, the totality of 
     such activity constitutes an invasion;
       Whereas, on October 26, 2021, Arizona State Representative 
     Jake Hoffman sent a letter to Arizona Attorney General Mark 
     Brnovich requesting a formal legal opinion determining 
     whether President Biden has violated his obligations to 
     protect Arizona from invasion under section 4 of article IV 
     of the United States Constitution; and
       Whereas, on February 7, 2022, Arizona Attorney General Mark 
     Brnovich issued a formal legal opinion, which states, in 
     part--
       (1) ``The on-the-ground violence and lawlessness at 
     Arizona's border caused by cartels and gangs is extensive, 
     well-documented, and persistent. It can satisfy the 
     definition of `actually invaded' and `invasion' under the 
     U.S. Constitution.''; and
       (2) ``Arizona retains the independent authority under the 
     State Self-Defense Clause to defend itself when actually 
     invaded.'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate finds that--
       (1) President Biden's dereliction of duty and failure to 
     take care that the laws be faithfully executed at our 
     southern border has directly put the citizens of all 50 
     States in danger and has resulted in loss of life;
       (2) the violent activity and smuggling of drugs, humans, 
     guns, and other illicit goods carried out by drug cartels and 
     transnational criminal organizations, and the crossing of the 
     international border between legal ports of entry by 
     significant numbers of individuals contrary to the laws of 
     the United States, meet the definitions of--
       (A) ``actually invaded'' under clause 3 of section 10 of 
     article I of the United States Constitution; and
       (B) ``invasion'' under section 4 of article IV of the 
     United States Constitution; and
       (3) Governors of all 50 States possess the authority and 
     power as Commander-in-Chief of their respective States to 
     repel the invasion described in paragraph (2).

       Whereas there are 34 Tribal Colleges and Universities 
     operating on more than 90 campuses in 15 States;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are tribally 
     chartered or federally chartered institutions of higher

       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities serve students

       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities offer students 
     access to knowledge and skills grounded in cultural

       (2) enriches the United States as a nation;
       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities provide access to 
     high-quality postsecondary educational opportunities for--

                             HONORING HANNA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Hanna, 
as they celebrate their 75th anniversary.
  Since its founding in 1945, Hanna has helped over 4,000 young people 
in need. Initially created to address the troubling rise in juvenile 
delinquency in boys after the end of World War II, Hanna has gone to 
great lengths to transform the lives of young people in Sonoma County.
  The two main parts of Hanna consist of the Hanna Academy and the 
Hanna Center, which each do important work to benefit the lives of the 
young people they serve. Hanna Academy, for example, is dedicated to 
working with students that require trauma-informed empowerment, 
education, and training, and ensuring that they will meaningfully 
benefit from the organization's educational expertise. The Hanna 
Center, which is separate from Hanna Academy, works to provide mental 
health treatment and support for low-income children and teenagers, who 
are otherwise underserved in our community. The work that Hanna is 
doing to benefit the most vulnerable in our community is commendable.
  And they are endeavoring to expand their services. The Hanna Center 
recently opened a Community Mental Health Hub, which offers mental 
health services to all people, regardless of age. They also started 
their Transitional Housing Program, which works with young adults to 
work towards independent living, while living in a safe, supportive 
environment. These two programs, along with the advent of their new 
Vocational Training Program, will ensure that the most vulnerable 
members of our community are being adequately served and given the 
resources they need to thrive. Hanna's dedication to uplifting and 
empowering our Sonoma County children is admirable, which is why they 
are deserving of this recognition.
  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health support and 
trauma counseling for children is more desperately needed than ever. 
Hanna has committed to filling this need and ensuring that every child 
and young adult who leaves their programs is equipped with the tools 
they need to succeed and live happy lives.
  I am excited to honor all of Hanna's work at their 75th anniversary 
gala and fundraiser. This event is crucial to ensuring that all their 
important programs can continue with full funding. Hanna's critical 
role in our community is why I am thrilled to honor them here today.
  Mr. Speaker, Hanna is deeply appreciated for their tireless work on 
behalf of our community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
honor Hanna on its 75th anniversary.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Isabel Orozco 
for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
  Isabel has overcome many challenges along her journey to success, 
demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make 
the most of their education, like Isabel, develop crucial skills and a 
work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award 
is a testament to Isabel's hard work, determination, and perseverance 
at Jefferson Jr./Sr. High School and is clearly just the beginning of a 
bright and promising future.
  It is my honor to congratulate Isabel Orozco on achieving the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

                        HONORING DR. OS GUINNESS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE JOHNSON

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. 
Os Guinness for his distinguished career and his service to the 
American people and to Christians around the globe.
  Dr. Guinness has dedicated his life to thinking, writing, and 
speaking about the turbulent times in which we live. In the context of 
a Judeo-Christian worldview, he has provided thoughtful insights and 
wise counsel within the U.S. Capitol and to leaders and laypersons 
worldwide.
  I have been personally impacted by Os, which he prefers to be called, 
through his challenge to live for our ``Audience of One,'' a term he 
used in his book The Call to refer to our Heavenly Father. He has 
reminded me, and so many others, that we ought to dedicate our lives to 
that cause, to love our enemies, to promote justice, and to seek the 
good of the city in which we live.
  Os is beloved by so many on Capitol Hill. For more than 30 years, he 
has been involved with Faith and Law, an organization that helps 
hundreds of Christian staff members on the Hill think about their 
vocations in government through a biblical worldview. He draws the 
largest audiences of any speaker at their gatherings and has been 
meeting for breakfast with Members of Congress for several years. His 
listeners always leave with a better understanding of the times in 
which we live, and our calling to live out our national motto: In God 
We Trust.
  In recent days, Os has been challenging us to consider the 250th 
anniversary of the birth of our great Nation, which we will celebrate 
in 2026. He's referring to the anniversary as a ``civilizational 
moment,'' and is asking if 2026 will be America's expiration date or a 
challenge to renew the great experiment in freedom.
  I'm optimistic that we are up for the task.
  Os was born in China, during World War II, to medical missionaries, 
and witnessed the climax of the Chinese revolution in 1949.
  He was educated in England, where he completed his undergraduate 
degree at the University of London and his Doctor of Philosophy in the 
social sciences from Oxford University. Os has written or edited more 
than 30 books, including The Call, Unspeakable, A Free People's 
Suicide. The Global Public Square, and The Magna Carta of Humanity.
  Os has also been a Guest Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center for 
International Studies, a Guest Scholar and Visiting Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution, and Senior Fellow at the Trinity Forum.
  More importantly, he is the proud husband of Jenny and father of C.J. 
I have had the honor of meeting with both Os and Jenny on many 
occasions and have greatly appreciated their commitment to fasting and 
praying weekly for America's leaders.
  The impact of the life and work of Dr. Os Guinness will be felt in 
the Halls of Congress and around the globe long past the time that we 
are here. I know that I, and many more around the world, are trying to 
live by the words he wrote in his book, The Call: ``We are not 
primarily called to do something or go somewhere; we are called to 
Someone. We are not called first to the special work but to God. The 
key to answering the call is to be devoted to no one and to nothing 
above God himself.''
  On behalf of the United States Congress--and countless colleagues who 
have been impacted by this great man--it is my honor to recognize Dr. 
Os Guinness for his distinguished career and impact on our Nation.

     HONORING THE EXCEPTIONAL LIFE AND SERVICE OF JOSHUA E. GUSHLAW

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and service 
of Joshua Edward Gushlaw.
  Joshua was born and raised in Plattsburgh, New York, in 1990. After 
graduating from Plattsburgh High in 2008, he bravely decided to serve 
his nation by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps. Joshua 
served with the utmost distinction throughout his four years of 
service, earning two campaign medals, the Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense Ribbon, 
and the Combat Action Ribbon, Josh was also recognized for his 
dedication and received the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.

[[Page E444]]

  Following his Honorable Discharge in 2012, Joshua returned to his 
hometown where he attended and graduated from Plattsburgh State 
University. Later, after graduating from the New York State Police 
Academy, Joshua joined the ranks of New York's finest with the New York 
State Police. He was posted in Plattsburgh, the community he loved so 
dearly and served dutifully every day of his life.
  While he kept the North Country safe, Joshua was also building a 
family at home. In 2018, he married his wife Katie and soon after they 
were blessed with two boys: Maverick and Jaxx. Joshua was a caring 
husband and a wonderful father to his sons, spending time with whom he 
treasured most. Perhaps most impressive of all is that Joshua, despite 
the demanding nature of each of his roles, still found time to give 
back to his community through his involvement in the American Legion. 
His commitment to his community was truly boundless.
  The North Country lost one of its best when Joshua passed on February 
20th, 2022. I continue to pray for his family and share in their grief 
from this terrible loss; we all stand to learn plenty from the selfless 
example Joshua set.
  On behalf of New York's 21st District, we thank Joshua, for his 
lifetime of service and the legacy that he left us.

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Arthur Bourgeois 
of Exeter, New Hampshire on his 100th birthday. A World War II Navy 
Veteran, active community member, and loving family man, Arthur has 
shown what it means to devote his life to his loved ones, community, 
and country.
  On this special day, I commend Arthur on his distinguished lifetime 
that exemplifies service and dedication. During World War II, 
individuals like Arthur sacrificed their lives to defend our freedom 
and democracy. His contributions have left a mark on our nation's 
history and the world. His bravery and selflessness during one of the 
most tiresome times in American history has not gone unnoticed. The 
sacrifices made and the challenges overcome speak volumes about 
Arthur's character and will serve as an inspiration for generations to 
come.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional 
District, I want to thank Arthur Bourgeois for his service and wish him 
a happy 100th birthday. While we can never fully repay our debt of 
gratitude, we recognize and applaud his decades of service. I look 
forward to seeing what his next chapter holds, and I wish him all the 
best in his future endeavors.

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Assistant 
Commissioner Field Aniceto Ortiz upon his retirement from the Ceres 
Police Department.
  On December 16, 2023, Assistant Commissioner Field Aniceto Ortiz 
retired from the California Highway Patrol (CHP), after serving for 30 
years. Aniceto was responsible for CHP field operations in the State of 
California and was responsible for nearly nine thousand employees.
  Aniceto served in various assignments across the state, such as Chief 
of Central Division in Fresno, a Special Response Team Commander, and 
was an inaugural member of the Department's Office of Inspector 
General.
  Aniceto engaged with the communities he served to provide the highest 
level of Safety, Service and Security to the people of the state of 
California. Throughout his career, Aniceto held firm to the CHP's 
organizational values to serve and safeguard communities with 
compassion and understanding.
  Aniceto is a first generation American and was the first in his 
family to serve in law enforcement. He is a graduate of the FBI 
National Academy, FBI California Law Enforcement Executive Development 
Seminar, and the Naval Postgraduate School Executive Leaders Program.
  Aniceto continues to serve his community by volunteering for several 
community organizations, including the Visually Impaired Persons 
Support group, Children's Crisis Center, Rotary Club, and as an 
honorary board member for Without Permission, Inc. And upon his 
retirement, I want to extend my best wishes to Assistant Commissioner 
Ortiz on his new journey.

               HONORING THE HISTORICAL SOCEITY OF WINTERS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Historical Society of Winters, who are doing crucial work to preserve 
and commemorate the history of Winters' Japanese community.
  The Historical Society of Winters began in 2004 as the Winters 
History Committee, initially created by the Winters City Council. In 
2018, it became a nonprofit, and opened the Winters Museum that same 
Year. Their express intention was to be a `museum without walls,' and 
to commemorate all the history of Winters, especially the history that 
had been forgotten.
  One of the most important forgotten histories that the Historical 
Society has unearthed and commemorated is that of the pre-World War II 
Japanese community in Winters. In 1888, the first Japanese immigrants 
arrived in Winters, looking to create better lives for themselves and 
their families. Over the years, as more immigrants arrived, they 
created a thriving Japantown on the edge of the city. At its peak, the 
Japanese population of Winters numbered approximately 300 people.
  Sadly, as World War II began, and President Roosevelt ordered the 
internment of all Japanese Americans on the West Coast, the community 
was torn apart. The thriving Japantown was abandoned, and all the 
families were sent to internment camps either in

[[Page E445]]

Arizona or Colorado. But that was not the end of the story of this 
community. When the war finally ended on V-J Day in 1945. Japantown 
burned down in a suspicious fire. Due to this hostility, less than 15 
percent of the pre-war Japanese residents returned to Winters.
  This legacy of hostility and distrust of these people led to the 
stories of this integral Winters community being largely lost to 
history. But the Historical Society of Winters, along with the work of 
Japanese community members, has worked tirelessly to restore these 
memories and commemorate this essential part of our community's 
history.
  To do this, the Historical Society took their advocacy to the local 
level. In the summer of 2023, they urged the Winters City Council to 
approve a monument which would commemorate the existence and history of 
the pre-war Japanese community and Japantown. In a unanimous vote, the 
city council approved the placement of the monument in Rotary Park, 
where the community once existed.
  Without the dedicated and tireless advocacy by the Historical 
Society, as well as members of Winters' Japanese community, our 
community would likely have never learned about the existence and 
history of the pre-war community that shaped so much of this town.
  Mr. Speaker, the Historical Society of Winters is deeply appreciated 
for their work to preserve and commemorate the pre-war Japanese 
community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor them here 
today.

                      HONORING PFC JOSEPH F. MOORE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor United States World 
War II Army veteran Joseph F. Moore.
  Joseph Moore was born in Benton Harbor, Michigan on March 4, 1910. He 
was raised in Benton Harbor until 1922 when his family moved to 
Prospect Heights in North Greenbush, New York. Joseph enlisted in the 
U.S. Army on April 7, 1944, where he served as a Rifleman in the 71st 
Infantry Regiment. He spent 11 months overseas in Northern France, the 
Rhineland, and Central Europe, participating in three major European 
campaigns.
  Moore remained in the Army until his honorable discharge on October 
26, 1945, at the rank of Private First Class. For his brave service. he 
was awarded the European-African-Middle Eastern Medal with three bronze 
service stars, the Combat Infantry Badge, and the Good Conduct Medal. 
The 71st Infantry Regiment's Second Battalion is cited for its 
outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy in Eastern 
France in December 1944 and January 1945.
  After his honorable discharge, Joseph returned to New York to pursue 
a career and start a family. He obtained a job as manager at B.F. 
Goodrich Store in Albany, New York. Joseph married his beloved wife, 
Ethel McGeough-Moore and together they had four children, Elizabeth, 
Lela, Francis, and Ethel. He retired from B.F. Goodrich Store in 1972 
after 42 years of employment.
  When he was not working, Joseph maintained a fulfilling personal life 
and enjoyed hobbies such as traveling and smoking cigars. He was an 
active communicant of St. Mary's Church in Clinton Heights, New York, 
and a dedicated member of the Melvin Roads American Legion Post 1231, a 
veteran organization devoted to their community.
  Joseph's dedication and service to the United States is truly 
remarkable. On behalf of New York's 21st District, I am honored to 
recognize his extraordinary life.

 RECOGNIZING AARON DONTEZ YATES, TECH N9NE, FOR HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 
                           THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 
extraordinary actions and success of an accomplished individual in 
Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, Aaron Dontez Yates, better 
known as his stage name Tech N9ne. Today, we join in recognition of the 
milestones he has achieved throughout his career in the music industry.
  Born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, Tech N9ne embarked on a 
journey looking for ways in which he could express himself. From an 
early age, he began to rap, first using it as a method to learn and 
remember how to spell his name and later to release his inner thoughts 
and emotions. Before taking a leap of faith in seeking success on his 
own, he was part of the groups Black Mafia, 57th Street Rogue Dog 
Villains, and the Regime, where he began to get acquainted with the 
industry and would lead him to move forward in opening his own record 
label. Strange Music, with his business partner Travis O-Guin.
  With releases such as ``Anghellic'' and ``Everready (The Religion),'' 
his discography stands as a testament to his unparalleled talent and 
unwavering dedication to his craft. His talent and ability to create 
new rhythms and rhymes have not been overlooked and have instead 
garnered the attention of other acclaimed artists as well as solidified 
his status as a true pioneer in the world of hip-hop and rap. His 
success and unique approach have led to collaborations with artists 
Machine Gun Kelly, Lil Wayne, and Eminem among others. His love for his 
hometown is apparent through a now football season classic. ``Red 
Kingdom'', a love song to the Kansas City Chiefs

[[Page E446]]

as he remains an avid supporter of his local sports teams.
  Moreover, Tech N9ne's endeavors go beyond the music industry as he 
uses his platform to give back and better the lives of those who 
surround him. Through his work in philanthropy, Tech N9ne has provided 
support to organizations Habitat for Humanity, Harvesters Community 
Food Network as well as other organizations focusing on mental health 
awareness. His desire to improve and further help build his community 
in Kansas City, Missouri, is truly admirable and selfless.
  As we come together to celebrate the legacy that Tech N9ne has built 
and continues to build upon, it is important to emphasize that his 
influence is clearly visible among our community as he holds a 
compassion and commitment to address issues outside the music arena. He 
is not only leaving his mark in the music industry but also providing 
others, especially those in the Fifth District, with the inspiration, 
motivation, and model to pursue their passions while remaining engaged 
in helping improve the quality of life of others. Furthermore, Tech 
N9ne has become a symbol of our city and an example of the many 
talented and bright individuals that make our city our home.
  Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Tech 
N9ne for his tremendous accomplishments, contributions, and inspiration 
to others. On behalf of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I wish 
Tech N9ne congratulations on his well-deserved success and a continued 
journey filled with continued accomplishments, and fulfillment.

residents from across Central Florida will gather at the Cocoa Beach 
Pier in Cocoa Beach, Florida, to take part in the Thirteenth Annual 
``Footprints in the Sand'' Cocoa Beach Kidney Walk. Katie and I have 
joined others in our community in participating since the first walk 
was organized in 2012 by Rich Salick, Bill Hahn and volunteers with the 
Florida Affiliate of the National Kidney Foundation.
  The ``Footprints in the Sand'' Kidney Walk brings our community 
together to show our love and concern. So many of us have family, 
friends and loved ones that are afflicted by kidney disease, and they 
need our strength and support. The road ahead is not easy for them, but 
as the kidney walk demonstrates, they do not have to travel that path 
alone.
  The National Kidney Foundation of Florida, its supporters and 
activists have made a significant difference in people's lives. They 
not only raise awareness about this disease, but they have helped push 
for much needed changes in our laws and new innovations to give 
patients more treatment options and a better quality of life. This year 
organizers of the kidney walk will recognize organ donors and their 
families for giving the precious gift of life so that others could 
receive a second chance and continue with their lives.
  Those recognized include:
  Dawn Futch honoring Michael-Gene Futch, Paola Solis honoring 
Amishadai Solis, Nancy Velazquez honoring Pedro Batista, Monica 
Beyrooti honoring Seth Anthony Beyrooti, Giselle Rivera honoring Sean 
Bridges Rivera, Pat Brown honoring Michael Brown, Mary Carpenter

 STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON INTRODUCTION OF THE 
            WASHINGTON CHANNEL PUBLIC ACCESS ACT MAY 6, 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I introduce the Washington Channel Public 
Access Act. This bill would prohibit the Secretary of the Army from 
finalizing, implementing or enforcing any rule that would restrict 
access to the Washington Channel (Channel) in the District of Columbia.
  In 2019, the Secretary of the Army proposed a rule to establish a 
permanent restricted area in the Channel adjacent to Fort McNair, which 
would have restricted access to the navigable portion of the Channel by 
narrowing the waterway where recreational and commercial vessels could 
traverse and prohibited anchoring and mooring altogether. The U.S. Army 
Military District of Washington cited security needs at Fort McNair to 
justify the rule.
  The proposed rule was arbitrary and capricious and would have 
unnecessarily restricted recreational and commercial access to the 
Channel without providing any security benefits.
  Neighborhoods like The Yards and The Wharf have reinvigorated 
community engagement on the waterfront, and the Channel is increasingly 
used for regional transportation and recreation. The stretch of the 
Channel past Fort McNair is the only connection to the Potomac River. 
The rule would have likely forced kayaks, paddleboards and recreational 
boats into the same space as water taxis and river cruise ships, 
creating a potentially dangerous situation.

[[Page E447]]

  I hosted a public meeting in which community members expressed 
overwhelming opposition to the proposed rule, but military officials 
did not address the question of whether less restrictive measures could 
provide the same security. I then wrote asking Secretary of Defense 
Lloyd Austin to direct the U.S. Army Military District of Washington 
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the proposed rule and 
to prohibit these agencies from proposing a similar rule. In 2021, the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed a version of this 
bill. In 2022, the U.S. Army withdrew the proposed rule. Nevertheless, 
this bill is necessary to ensure that the Secretary of the Army does 
not finalize, implement or enforce a rule that would restrict public 
access to the Channel.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the 
celebration of the 25th annual Bronx Bankers Breakfast. The Breakfast 
is an opportunity for members of the Bronx finance community to come 
together to speak on the state of our community's economy, to honor 
members for their monumental work in the Bronx, and to share ideas on 
how we can continue improving the Bronx. A special thanks to the hosts 
of the event for all their hard work setting up this event. The 
Business Initiative Corporation of New York (BICNY). The Bronx Economic 
Development Corporation (BXEDC), and our esteemed Borough President 
Vanessa Gibson all play integral roles in our community and this event.
  BICNY is a community-based lending institution that helps Businesses 
in the Bronx access the U.S. Small Business Administration 504 loans. 
BICNY provides lower interest rate loans and long-term capital for a 
business community that has historically been ignored by investors. As 
of April of this year BICNY has facilitated over $365,000 in loans to 
small businesses in the Bronx community, with $330,000 in loans already 
closed. BICNY's work has also been impactful for small business 
workers. BICNY's assistance helped to retain 454 jobs and helped to 
create more than 1,600 jobs in Bronx small businesses as of April 1st.
  Since 1981, The Bronx Economic Development Corporation (BXEDC) has 
been supporting economic prosperity in the Bronx by providing access to 
funds for Bronx small businesses that have historically had trouble 
acquiring capital. BXEDC has over 820 million specifically allocated 
for the South Bronx. BXEDC has transformed the outlook for small 
businesses in the Bronx through their programs like the Bronx Business 
Continuity Loan (BBCL) program, with the average loan licensed being 
$72,000. BXEDC has also invested in creating a green future through 
working with local colleges and universities, awarding $1 million to 
Bronx Community College to create greener technology on campus, along 
with reviving downtown by allotting $1 million to the twelve Bronx 
Business Improvement Districts (BIDs).
  I am truly grateful to the members of these organizations that help 
the Bronx flourish economically. I look forward to seeing the growth 
and success of small businesses in the Bronx.

Dr. Ryan returned to the CIA in 1982 to join the faculty.
  Over the next 42 years, Dr. Ryan drove extraordinary growth and 
global impact at the CIA. He served as a director, vice president, and 
executive vice president before ultimately being named president in 
2001, making him the College's first alum to hold the position. As CIA 
President, he acquired and added branch campuses such as CIA at Copia, 
in Napa Valley, CIA San Antonio, Texas, Singapore, and the growth of 
the Hyde Park, New York campus. These locations have become centers of 
food, wine, spirits, beverage, and culinary education, where the next 
generation of chefs, sommeliers, and food and hospitality leaders are 
developed.
  Throughout Dr. Ryan's career, he has positively impacted the food and 
beverage industry through his platform as CIA president and numerous 
other leadership positions. He was elected President of the American 
Culinary Federation, the Nation's largest organization of chefs, and 
was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant 
Association. In 2023, Dr. Ryan was appointed to the U.S. Department of 
State Diplomatic Culinary Partnership. The ``Kitchen Cabinet'' was 
charged to find innovative ways of embracing food, hospitality, and 
community as diplomatic tools to engage world leaders, further 
crosscultural dialogue, and strengthen our bilateral relationships.
  Dr. Ryan was named ``One of the 50 Most Powerful People in Food'' by 
Nation's Restaurant News and has received awards from countless food 
industry organizations. Dr. Ryan is one of five Americans to ever 
receive the Presidential Medal from the World Association of Chefs 
Societies, and he was inducted into the James Beard Foundation's who's 
who of Food and Beverage in America.
  Mr. Speaker, no modern culinary educator or culinarian has had as 
much influence on American Food dining or the culinary profession as 
Dr. Tim Ryan. His efforts have not only cultivated and shaped the next 
generation of culinarians, but also has left a legacy of what it means 
to be an exquisite person. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor him here today.

                  HONORING THE SERVICE OF RYAN PROPIS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARK E. GREEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ryan 
J. Propis for his distinguished service to the House Committee on 
Homeland Security and the United States Congress.
  Ryan is a proud alumnus of the University of Florida and the 
University of Miami School of Law. Armed with a profound commitment to 
public service, Ryan embarked on his professional career as a legal 
fellow with the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2013 before working 
as a legislative staffer to then-Congressman Ted Yoho. Subsequently, in 
2015, he joined the House Committee on Homeland Security for his first 
tour, where he served as Counsel and Senior Counsel under the 
leadership of then-Chairman Michael McCaul. In a testament to his hard 
work and leadership, he was asked to join the Executive Branch, where 
he became an invaluable aide to the Administrator of the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) in 2018. Again, Ryan's dedication to our 
Nation's security earned him a promotion to become TSA's Chief of Staff 
in 2019. There, he capably led a workforce dedicated to protecting the 
nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for 
people and commerce.

[[Page E448]]

  At the end of the Trump Administration, Ryan returned to the Homeland 
Security Committee as General Counsel under the leadership of then-
Ranking Member John Katko. Later in 2021, Ryan took on an additional 
role as Deputy Staff Director. He has served with distinction in both 
roles since. Having worked with Ryan since the beginning of the 118th 
Congress, I have seen firsthand how Ryan exemplifies what it means to 
be a public servant. He possesses a wealth of knowledge in homeland 
security policy and the challenges facing our Nation every day. He has 
served the Homeland Security Committee faithfully under the leadership 
of three different chairmen or ranking member. Ryan's invaluable 
contributions have significantly benefitted the Committee's approach to 
our nation's greatest challenges, from the crisis at our Southwest 
border to the increasing threat of cyberattacks.
  Ryan's steady leadership and wise counsel have helped ensure a 
seamless transition during a period of significant change, as 
Republicans took the House Majority in 2023 and the Committee on 
Homeland Security gained a new Chairman. He has been a key part of our 
historic successes this Congress--from the passage of H.R. 2 to the 
accountability of the Department of Homeland Security we have delivered 
for the American people.
  I am deeply grateful for Ryan's invaluable service to the Committee 
and our Nation. Ryan is a true patriot, and I am confident he will 
continue to distinguish himself as he decamps for the private sector. 
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the House 
Committee on Homeland Security, I commend Ryan for his diligent service 
and wish him well in all his future endeavors.

          RECOGNIZING 2024 HMONG-AMERICAN DAY IN MERCED COUNTY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN S. DUARTE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May 14, 2024 as 
Hmong-American Day, honoring the legacy of the Hmong people who served, 
were wounded, or lost their lives in battle. Their sacrifice, to ensure 
America remains the land of the free, knowing we forever owe a debt of 
gratitude for their sacrifice. We recognize the important cultural, 
social, political, and economic contributions of Hmong Americans that 
provide generational enrichment and enhancement to this county across 
many sectors, including CBOs, business, healthcare, education, public 
safety, and government.
  From 1961 to 1975, more than 40,000 Hmong individuals were recruited 
by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to fight alongside American 
soldiers in the Secret War, a vital part of the Vietnam War, in Laos. 
But in 1975, the Fall of Long Chen forced thousands of Hmong to flee 
Laos to seek refuge from persecution, where many refugees and their 
families immigrated to other countries, including the United States, 
and to California--where today Merced is home to more than 8,000 Hmong 
residents.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in celebrating Hmong-American Day and 
formally recognizing and celebrating the rich history, culture, and 
contributions of Hmong Americans in Merced County and other communities 
throughout California.

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional 
career and the dedicated service of Timothy Joseph Walker.
  Timothy began his career in 1987, initially serving as a United 
States Air Force Explosives and Narcotics Detection K9 Officer with the 
Department of Defense. Transitioning to the United States Department of 
Agriculture in 1991, he continued his service as a K9 Officer at Newark

Team member in Ray Brook, New York.
  In 1996, Timothy began his career with United States Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP), starting as a U.S. Customs Officer with the 
Department of Treasury at the Port of Alexandria Bay, New York. In 
2003, he began his time with the Department of Homeland Security as a 
CBP officer and remained in Alexandria Bay until being promoted to 
Supervisory Customs and Border Protection Officer and moved to 
Ogdensburg, New York. During this time, he was responsible for front 
line management of daily operations. Continuing to display his 
leadership acumen, Timothy was promoted to Assistant Area Port Director 
Trade stationed in Alexandria Bay. In 2010, Timothy assumed the pivotal 
role of Port Director in Ogdensburg, serving an admirable three years 
before returning to Alexandria Bay and becoming Area Port Director, a

management of 226 Customs Border Protection employees.
  Timothy's 36 years of employment with the United States is a 
testament to his unwavering commitment to our Nation. On behalf of New 
York's 21st Congressional District, I am deeply honored to acknowledge 
Timothy Walker's extraordinary career, tireless efforts, and steadfast 
devotion to the United States.

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Connie Plum who 
spent 41 years as a phenomenal educator for King William High School 
and to congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement.
  As a teacher, Connie dedicated her career to ensuring her students 
were civically engaged by organizing field trips to Washington D.C. to 
tour the Capitol. It is clear from the many honors she received just 
how impactful and loved as a teacher she truly was. Connie was voted 
King William High School Teacher of the Year three times, honored for 
Hardy County (WV) Teacher of the Year, and semi-finalist for WV Teacher 
of the Year. Despite all these awards, Connie will tell you that her 
single most important accomplishment was helping ``her kids'' become 
better citizens.
  Connie has set the bar high for teachers everywhere and for that, I 
thank her. For the positive impact she had on her students, Connie will 
be dearly missed in the King William County Public School district.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in celebrating the outstanding 
career of Connie Plum and congratulating her on retirement. May God 
bless her as she steps into this new chapter of her life.

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor Karen 
Urbano, whom I have named the 2024 Woman of the Year for Yolo County

          BERRYESSA SNOW MOUNTAIN NATIONAL MONUMENT EXPANSION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to thank President Joseph R. 
Biden, Jr. for his proclamation pursuant to the Antiquities Act of 1906 
expanding the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. I also thank 
Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-
CA), Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA04), and the Yocha Dehe Wintun 
Nation for their support in conserving this special place forever.
  President Biden's proclamation expands the Berryessa Snow Mountain 
National Monument to include approximately 13,696 additional acres of 
federally owned public land in Lake and Colusa Counties, California, 
encompassing the entirety of the Molok Luyuk region within the 
Monument. Second, it directs the federal Bureau of Land Management and 
the U.S. Forest Service to improve tribal co-management of the 
Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. Third, it renames the former 
Walker Ridge tract to ``Molok Luyuk,'' meaning Condor Ridge in the 
Patwin language of the Yocha Dehe and other Native American tribes 
indigenous to the area.
  I am thrilled that President Biden issued this presidential 
proclamation to preserve the tribal wisdom, heritage, and cultural 
traditions that Molok Luyuk has been home to for over 11,000 years. 
This expansion follows years of advocacy by me, Congressman Thompson, 
Senator Padilla; federal, tribal, and local officials representing 
Northern California; and nongovernmental organizations, including 
environmental conservation, public access, outdoor recreation, and off-
highway vehicle groups.
  In July 2015, President Obama issued Presidential Proclamation 9298, 
establishing the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. This set 
the boundary as federal land surrounding the Lake Berryessa reservoir 
but omitted Molok Luyuk in Lake and Colusa Counties. My legislation 
(H.R.761/S.393) in the 114th Congress with then-U.S. Senator Barbara 
Boxer (D-CA) and Congressman Thompson to establish the National 
Monument would have included Molok Luyuk within the boundary.
  In the 117th Congress, at the behest of Woodland, California-based 
Tuleyome, a nonprofit conservation advocacy organization co-founded by 
my former constituent Bob Schneider in 2002, I introduced the 
``Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act'' (H.R.6366/
S.4080) with Senator Padilla and Congressman Thompson. I and other 
members of California's Congressional delegation then called on 
President Biden to use his authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 
to expand the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument and provide 
opportunities for federally recognized tribes like the Yocha Dehe to 
engage in voluntary co-management with the relevant federal land 
management agencies. We also called on Secretary Deb Haaland to order 
the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to officially rename Walker Ridge to 
Molok Luyuk. On May 2, 2024, I joined the President in the Oval Office 
with Secretary Haaland for a signing ceremony granting our requests.
  Conserving California's special places has been a lifelong passion 
throughout my tenure in the state legislature, as Deputy Secretary of 
the Interior during the Clinton Administration, and now as a Member of 
Congress. Molok Luyuk is one of those special places. It was a 
privilege to represent Lake and Colusa Counties as the U.S. 
Representative for California's Third Congressional District from 2013 
to 2023, and I am honored to have played a leading role in expanding 
the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument to preserve Molok Luyuk's 
ecological diversity and tribal heritage for future generations.
  Lastly, I want to thank my former Legislative Assistant, Mr. Tigran 
Agdaian, and my former Knauss Fellows, Mr. Sean Mullin and Mr. Jeffrey 
Beauvais, for their important role in developing this legislation while 
on my staff.
  President Biden's expansion of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument honors the Patwin Tribes who walked this land long before our 
country was founded. On behalf of California's Congressional 
delegation, I thank the President.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mayor Oscar

sense of community, and financial stability, Mayor Trevino has 
prioritized safety, security, and economic development for North 
Richland Hills. Mayor Trevino believes it is important to collaborate 
and work with other communities to improve regional problems.
  His leadership style is inclusive and consensus-based as shown by his

Midwest Texas Section presented him with the Planning Advocate Award in

  Mayor Oscar Trevino's awards and memberships not only reflect his 
outstanding work ethic but also his dedication to our community. It is 
my pleasure to honor Mayor Oscar Trevino on his career with North 
Richland Hills and celebrate his commitment to our community. I 
congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement.

  Rabbi Zoberman is the founder and spiritual leader of Temple

Arts in Political Science from Chicago's Roosevelt University in 1970. 
He has a Master of Art in Political Science from the University of

          COMMEMORATING THE KALAMAZOO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL HUIZENGA

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Kalamazoo 
County Sheriff's Office for its recognition as an accredited agency by 
the Michigan Law Enforcement Accreditation Commission. This achievement 
acknowledges the commitment to professionalism and excellence in law 
enforcement that has been demonstrated by the Kalamazoo County 
Sheriff's Office.
  The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office was founded in 1830 and 
provides services to over 250,000 residents in the area. Under the 
leadership of Sheriff Richard Fuller, who has been serving Kalamazoo 
County as sheriff for more than 15 years, the Sheriff's Office has been 
recognized as the ``gold standard'' for law enforcement agencies.
  In February of 2024, the Sheriff's Office underwent a lengthy board 
review to approve their eligibility for formal accreditation following 
a process that took two years to complete. Through this process, the 
Michigan Law Enforcement Accreditation Commission board confirmed that 
the Sheriff's Office met over 500 standards, covering an array of 
protocols from the hiring process to policing standards to the 
conduction of investigations.
  I would like to thank the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office for their 
continued dedication to protecting and serving the residents of 
Kalamazoo County. As only the second Michigan's sheriff's office to 
achieve this accreditation, this accomplishment is commendable.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Kalamazoo County 
Sheriff's Office on their accreditation.

        HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF REVEREND CECIL WILLIAMS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. NANCY PELOSI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life, 
leadership and service of

[[Page E451]]

Reverend Cecil Williams: a spiritual giant who devoted his life to 
empowering those marginalized, forgotten and in need.
  Reverend Williams embodied the Gospel of Matthew: `for I was hungry 
and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a 
stranger and you welcomed me. I was naked and you clothed me. I was 
sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you visited me.' Through 
his many good works, he transformed countless lives--in the Bay Area 
and beyond.
  Reverend Williams stood on the forefront of the American struggle for 
civil rights and social justice: whether fighting against racism, 
protesting the Vietnam War, confronting the crack cocaine epidemic or 
bringing compassion to those with HIV/AIDS, to name just a few of his 
many good works. In a moment when the LGBTQ+ community faced intense 
discrimination and stigma, Reverend Williams began presiding over the 
weddings of same-sex couples in San Francisco--nearly five decades 
before marriage equality became the law of the land.
  Alongside his beloved wife Janice Mirikitani, who was his partner not 
only in marriage but in service, Reverend Cecil Williams helped launch 
and lead the GLIDE Memorial Church for six decades. Strengthened by 
their belief in unconditional love and the power of redemption, GLIDE 
has built a community of compassion and inclusion in the heart of one 
San Francisco's toughest neighborhoods. Today, more than 11,000 San 
Franciscans of all races, ethnic backgrounds, cultures, social classes, 
ages, faiths and sexual orientations are a part of GLIDE's vibrant, 
diverse congregation.
  Living out Reverend Williams and Janice's faith-based social justice 
mission, GLIDE is also one of the largest providers of social services 
in the city. GLIDE serves three nutritious meals a day, 365 days a 
year, to thousands of San Franciscans in need--while offering 
comprehensive support services, including affordable, accessible, 
quality health care, mental health services, and HIV/AIDS and substance 
abuse treatment. GLIDE also helps women overcome domestic violence and 
oppression by providing housing, child care and supportive services.
  Reverend Williams was not only respected but revered in our City as a 
clarion voice for love, respect and justice. At the same time, he 
embodied the spirit of our City's patron saint, Saint Francis of 
Assisi, who taught us to `Preach the gospel. Sometimes use words.' 
Indeed, he preached the gospel with his inspiring deeds each and every 
day.
  May it be a comfort to Reverend Williams' children Kim and Albert, 
his stepdaughter Tianne, his grandchildren and all his loved ones that 
so many San Franciscans mourn their loss and pray for them during this 
sad time--and that his saintly teachings will live on in the hearts of 
all those who were blessed to know him.

               HONORING JACKSONVILLE MAYOR SAMMY PHILLIPS

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a faithful public 
servant, Mayor John (Sammy) Phillips of Jacksonville, North Carolina. 
Recently, celebrating his 50th anniversary of service to the city, 
Mayor Phillips dedicated most of his adult life to helping the people 
of Jacksonville. Everyone who knows him can attest to his strong work 
ethic and selfless devotion to his community.
  In 1974, Mayor Phillips started his career as an officer with the 
Jacksonville Police Department and, after serving for over thirty 
years, retired as Deputy Chief of Police. Thanks to his leadership and 
dedication, the Jacksonville Police Department became a nationally 
accredited law enforcement agency in 1991. While Mayor Phillips served 
in the Police Department, he also worked to complete academic studies. 
He graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National 
Academy, a premier law enforcement training program in Quantico, 
Virginia. Taking night classes, he earned a Bachelor's degree in 
criminal justice from North Carolina Wesleyan College. Mayor Phillips 
also completed a Master's in Public Administration from East Carolina 
University. Mayor Phillips's sacrifices during his law enforcement 
career to further his profession and knowledge base are quite laudable.
  In 2004, when Mayor Phillips retired from the Police Department, he 
couldn't resist his love for his community and commitment to public 
service. After a few months of working around his house and playing 
golf, he filed for a seat on the City Council in 2004. After a stint on 
the City Council, he decided to run for Mayor and was elected in 
November 2007. Now going on 17 years, Mayor Phillips is the longest-
serving Mayor of Jacksonville since W. Bruce Teachey. During his tenure 
as Mayor, Mr. Phillips has been known for his attentiveness to the 
concerns of his Jacksonville constituents. In 2017, when renewed racial 
tensions arose, Mayor Phillips was determined to bring all residents of 
Jacksonville together. He helped to launch the ``One City, Our City, My 
City'' campaign to promote healing in his community. In 2014, Mayor 
Phillips received the Long Leaf Pine Award, an honor given to North 
Carolinians with an exemplary record of public service. Mayor Phillips 
has spearheaded much development in the city, including revitalizing 
the Jacksonville City Hall, building multiple fire stations, and 
constructing the Jacksonville Marina. A lifelong resident of 
Jacksonville, Mayor Phillips has demonstrated his love for the city and 
its inhabitants. I feel honored to extend this chamber's recognition of 
this faithful public servant, and I look forward to the future success 
of Jacksonville with Mayor Phillips at the helm.

HONORING KEITH AND GINGER MYERS, FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOUISIANA'S 
                          HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CLAY HIGGINS

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Myers 
family of Lafayette, this year's University of Louisiana at Lafayette 
(ULL) Alumni Association Spring Gala honorees.
  Mr. Keith Myers and Mrs. Ginger Myers have served as health care 
industry leaders for decades. In 1994, they co-founded LHC Group in 
order to address the health care needs of Lafayette's aging rural 
community. The Myers grew a freestanding single home health agency into 
a publicly traded company of almost 30,000 employees, now operating in 
38 states and the District of Columbia. LHC Group's success, along with 
its significant mission, must be attributed to the Myers' own virtue.
  As LHC Group's first nurse, Mrs. Myers established the company's 
service-based culture. She has worked in a range of nursing and 
administrative roles in St. Landry Parish; served on LHC Group's board 
of directors; and helped to establish one of Louisiana's first rural 
health clinics. She was chair of the Opelousas Woman's Club board; a 
committee member for the St. Landry/Evangeline American Heart 
Association Heart Gala; and on the executive committee for Go Red for 
Women, an American Heart Association fundraiser.
  For his part, Mr. Myers served as LHC Group's chairman and chief 
executive officer from the company's inception, up to its merger with 
Optum. He is currently senior adviser for Optum and chairman and CEO 
emeritus for LHC Group. Mr. Myers is a co-founder, board member, and 
current chairman of the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare in

sciences.
  On behalf of Louisiana's 3rd District, I commend Keith and Ginger 
Myers for their generous work, and I thank them for their devotion to 
South Louisiana.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Napa County Library Literacy Center as they celebrate 40 years of 
literary services.
  In 1984, the Napa County Library was one of twenty-seven programs 
that help pilot library literacy within California, the first of its 
kind in the United States. The Literacy Center has committed to helping 
adult learners improve their reading and writing skills in English. 
Over 40 years, the Napa County Library Literacy Center has helped more 
than 15,000 adult learners become literate, expanding their 
capabilities.
  With the assistance of volunteer tutors, adult learners can also 
improve their computer skills, receive guidance on financial planning, 
access translation resources, and gain skills needed to obtain their 
General Education Diploma (GED).
  The Napa County Library has collaborated with several organizations 
in Napa County, including Napa Valley College, Napa Valley Adult 
Education, and the Napa Valley Unified School District, to provide 
various resources. The goal is to broaden the opportunities for 
everyone in our community.
  In partnership with the California State Library and Smart Horizons, 
the Napa County Library also offers adults the opportunity to earn an 
accredited high school diploma and career certificate online through 
Career Online High School (COHS).
  With a dedicated group of volunteers and other literacy and library 
staff, the Napa County Library is proud to be a part of State Library 
Literacy Services. Together, they have provided assistance to over 
300,000 adult learners through more than 106 programs.
  Mr. Speaker, the Napa County Library Literacy Center is deeply 
appreciated for their work on behalf of our community. It is, 
therefore. fitting and proper that we honor the Napa County Library.

           HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THOMAS W. KILLIAN

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 6, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional life 
and the dedicated service of United States Navy veteran Thomas William 
Killian.
  Thomas was born on April 8, 1931, in Troy, New York where he was 
raised and attended school before enlisting in the U.S. Navy. Thomas 
enlisted in the Navy in 1951, serving for twenty years during the 
Korean and Vietnam Wars. During his time in the Navy, he was trained as 
a shipfitter and served aboard the USS Baltimore (CA-68), a heavy 
cruiser; the USS Lowe (DE-325), an Edsall-class destroyer escort; the 
USS Sierra (AD-18), a Dixie-class destroyer tender; and the USS Jason 
(AR-8), a Vulcan-class repair ship. Thomas remained in the Navy until 
September of 1971, when he retired at the rank of First Class (E-6). 
For his service, Thomas was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, the 
National Defense Service Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal with two 
bronze stars.
  Thomas married his wife Patricia in October of 1952. Together, they 
shared 69 devoted years of marriage and had 4 children: Thomas, Beth, 
Colleen, and Patricia. After coming home from duty, Thomas returned to 
his wife and children in Troy. Utilizing the skills that he developed 
during his career with the Navy, he obtained a job as a fitter and 
welder at McKinney Steel Fabrications in Albany, New York where he 
worked for 22 years until his retirement in 1993.
  When Thomas was not working, he enjoyed spending time with his 
family. He had many hobbies including traveling, camping, surf fishing, 
and going on cruises. A beloved member of his community, he is 
remembered for his many professional and private accomplishments.
  On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize Thomas Killian's extraordinary life of service, hard work, 
profound commitment, and devotion to the United States.

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jose 
Lugo. Jose was a loving son, father, brother, uncle, cousin, and 
friend. He put others before himself, and he made people laugh 
endlessly. He loved music and having a good time with his family and 
friends, while always ensuring that his friends and family were taken 
care of. While Jose is no longer with us, his loved ones are left with 
so many beautiful memories of him. His favorite places to visit were 
Half Moon Bay, Pescadero, or any beach.
  He was selfless and truly had a heart of gold, and demonstrated this 
by choosing to donate his organs at the end of his life so that others 
would receive an opportunity to extend their lives. He was able to save 
five different lives by donating his earthly organs, and for that he is 
now a guardian angel and hero. He will forever be in his family's 
hearts, and with his loved ones wherever life takes them. We love him 
and he will be missed dearly. May he rest in peace.

                        BAILING OUT ART STUDENTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Biden 
unilaterally made the decision to cancel more than $6.1 billion in debt 
for 300,000 art students across our country.
  This is a bailout. This bailout is an insult to the tens of millions 
of Americans who either paid off their student loans or who never 
attended college in the first place.
  Instead of using taxpayer dollars in an attempt to win votes, 
President Biden should be turning his attention to the runaway 
inflation that has impacted every man, woman, and child in America. 
Parents shouldn't have to choose between buying gas or buying groceries 
for their families. Parents should not have to dip into their savings 
or into their retirement accounts to afford basic goods.
  Sadly, under President Biden, these decisions have become all too 
common. It is time to stop wasting taxpayer dollars on student bailouts 
and Green New Deal initiatives. It is time to return to fiscal 
restraint. It is time to put a stop to the runaway inflation that has 
become the trademark of the Biden administration.


                 Biden Administration's Secret Flights

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, the House Homeland 
Security Committee released documents that identified over 45 airport 
locations that were used by President Biden to secretly fly over 
400,000 illegal immigrants into our country.
  These documents, which the Biden administration only turned over 
under subpoena, show that Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden have 
been transporting illegal immigrants into communities across the United 
States.
  It is clear that President Biden is using our regional airports to 
spread this crisis and effectively make each and every State a border 
State.
  The American people cannot afford to have a Homeland Security 
Secretary that fails to keep America safe, and Pennsylvania families 
cannot afford a President who cares more about illegal immigrants than 
about the American people.

                      RECOGNIZING MAYOR JOHN CRUZ

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Guam 
(Mr. Moylan) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Mayor John Cruz 
as he serves his final term representing the village of Hagatna after 
almost two decades.
  Before becoming the mayor of Guam's capital, Cruz faithfully served 
the government of Guam for 25 years. His tenure shows his commitment to 
the people of Guam has been unwavering since the beginning. He has been 
a strong advocate for the island and a champion of public service.
  Present day, Cruz is known by many of his constituents for his 
beautification efforts in his village, ensuring Guam's special capital 
remains a cultural and historical hub.
  Most importantly, Cruz is a family man, devoted Catholic, and 
reliable mayor who puts his constituents first.

[[Page H2838]]

  I thank Mayor Cruz for his dedication to the people of Hagatna. His 
leadership has been instrumental in making the village what it is 
today. I wish him the very best in retirement, and I am certain his 
legacy will be an inspiration to all future leaders to come.


                      Honoring Dr. Vincent Duenas

  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a remarkable 
individual who has made significant contributions to the field of 
medicine, Dr. Vincent Duenas. His deep passion for healing and his 
tireless dedication to patient care has made a profound impact on the 
lives of countless individuals in my community, the island of Guam.
  As he retires from his position, I thank him for 45 years of service 
at the Guam Memorial Hospital Authority.
  In addition to his distinguished career as an internal medicine 
doctor, he has also held the titles of GMH's associate hospital 
administrator of medical services and medical director of respiratory 
therapy, among many other positions.
  One of the most remarkable aspects of Dr. Duenas' career is his 
exceptional ability to provide compassionate care. He has fostered an 
environment where patients can feel heard, understood, and supported.
  Aside from his time in the medical field, Dr. Duenas also served our 
Nation in uniform for 20 years. He was a member of the Guam Army 
National Guard, ultimately retiring with the rank of colonel.

  Dr. Duenas' accomplishments and contributions to medicine are truly 
inspiring. His dedication, expertise, and passion have made a positive 
impact on countless lives in Guam.
  Today, we honor Dr. Duenas and wish him the very best in his 
retirement. I am certain his legacy will continue to inspire future 
doctors to come.

                          HONORING CARL PARKER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. D'Esposito). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber of Texas) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
legacy of one Senator Carl Allen Parker, a true southeast Texas giant.
  Born in Port Arthur during the Great Depression, Senator Parker 
dedicated decades to serving the people of southeast Texas. He was a 
distinguished lawyer, statesman, and beloved native son of Port Arthur.
  Senator Parker leaves behind a legacy of unwavering dedication to 
public service and tireless advocacy for the people of our great State. 
He will be remembered for his 34 years as a member of the Texas 
Legislature, starting with his election to the House of Representatives 
in 1962 and then later to the Texas Senate, where he served until 1995.
  As we mourn the passing of this remarkable man, let us also celebrate 
his extraordinary life and the lasting impact he had on our State. May 
his legacy inspire future generations of public servants to follow in 
his footsteps and continue the work of building a better Texas for us 
all.


                   Honoring Judge Randall Hufstetler

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the extraordinary life of the Honorable Kenneth Randall 
Hufstetler, State district judge of the 300th District Court of 
Brazoria County. For his relentless dedication to public service and 
remarkable contributions to our community, he will always be remembered 
as a Brazoria County icon.
  Randy was a Texan whose life exemplified faith, family, and service. 
His tenure as a judge was marked by his steadfast commitment to 
upholding our United States Constitution. With integrity and diligence, 
he interpreted and applied the law to ensure fairness and justice in 
every single case that crossed his bench.
  Despite losing his battle with cancer too soon, Randy's legacy of 
courage and strength will endure, inspiring us all. Though he may no 
longer walk among us, Randy's impact will continue to be felt in the 
lives he touched and the values he instilled.
  To his beautiful family, Danette and kids, Randy was the epitome of 
love, strength, and devotion, cherishing each moment with them as the 
greatest gift of his life.
  To Judge Kenneth Randall Hufstetler, we say farewell with gratitude 
and admiration.


                        Honoring Gerald Sullivan

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
distinguished Texan, Gerald Sullivan, who has been selected as the 2024 
Buck N' Ball honoree.
  Gerald's story is nothing but a pure Lone Star legend, showcasing 
grit, guts, and a whole lot of Texas-sized success.
  From Galveston County to the halls of Texas A&M, Gerald's 
entrepreneurial spirit has left an indelible mark. As chairman of the 
Port of Galveston, he steered us through Hurricane Ike's wrath, 
ensuring our ports and Galveston's resilience.
  His dedication to education and sharing insights with students 
reflects his commitment to the next generation, not to mention the 
Sullivan family's century-long legacy in the beef cattle industry, 
grazing cattle in salt grass pastures along the Coastal Bend and then 
shipping them from the Port of Galveston to Caribbean nations like 
Haiti and Cuba.
  I congratulate Gerald and Susanne, his lovely bride, on Gerald 
receiving the Buck' N Ball award from the Bryan Museum in Galveston, 
where they are preserving Texas history. Gerald's commitment and 
dedication are inspiring to southeast Texas, and I am glad and proud to 
call him a friend.

                   DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN NIGER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Gaetz) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record part II of the 
interim report that I have prepared for the House of Representatives 
titled: ``Unwelcome in Niger.''

              [From the Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz]

               Part II Interim Report--Unwelcome In Niger


                                SUMMARY

       More than 1,000 U.S. service members currently stationed in 
     Niger, Africa, at Air Base 101 and Air Base 201 are in 
     danger. They are currently being treated as pawns by both the 
     U.S. government and the government of Niger (Conseil national 
     pour la sauvegarde de la patrie or the National Council for 
     the Safeguard of the Fatherland) as a diplomatic negotiation 
     regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger is 
     ongoing.
       Currently, U.S. troops are being denied fresh rotations and 
     needed medications for chronic illnesses as diplomatic 
     overflights are stalled.
       On information and belief, the Biden administration, and 
     particularly the U.S. State Department, are concealing the 
     dangerous conditions for U.S. troops in Niger to avoid the 
     embarrassing reveal that their Africa strategy has failed. It 
     has led to little more than collapsed governments, coups, and 
     orders to leave countries we once deemed a ``model'' for U.S. 
     cooperation, as Russia and China continue to advance their 
     interests.


                               BACKGROUND

       On April 17, 2024, this office filed with the House an 
     initial report on troop conditions in Niger, Africa. A copy 
     of this report is attached hereto as Exhibit ``A.''
       The report detailed an unfolding scandal, risking troop 
     welfare to avoid the diplomatic embarrassment as the Biden 
     administration has deployed an Africa strategy rife with 
     coups, failures, and functionally abandoned U.S. service 
     members. All with little to show for the billions of dollars 
     of U.S. taxpayer funds wasted in the continent.
       The Report detailed specific concerns expressed by troops 
     in Niger, Africa, their belief that intelligence regarding 
     their condition was being suppressed by U.S. Embassy Niger, 
     and the Department of State's inability to negotiate 
     diplomatic overflights to achieve troop rotations and deliver 
     life-sustaining supplies, such as clean water and medicine 
     for chronic conditions.
       The report further illuminated the presence of Russian 
     troops at Air Base 101, behind the wire. This is 
     unprecedented.


               BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL

       On April 20, 2024, the Biden administration fessed up that 
     U.S. troops would be leaving Niger following the embarrassing 
     demand to do so by the government of Niger. Unfortunately, 
     this announcement has neither eased tensions nor facilitated 
     better well-being for U.S. troops. During the negations 
     surrounding the withdrawal, the U.S. government has not 
     successfully obtained permissions to resupply U.S. 
     installations in Niger, leaving our troops stuck and 
     functionally abandoned, unable to return home.


            DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT, NIGER EMBASSY, WASHINGTON

       On April 29, 2024, Congressman Matt Gaetz met with Charge 
     d'Affaires Idi Hassane at the Washington, D.C.-based Niger 
     Embassy.
       Mr. Hassane assured Congressman Gaetz that all overflights 
     requested by the U.S.

[[Page H2839]]

     government for troop rotations and medicine would be 
     approved. Congressman Gaetz memorialized this attestation by 
     letter, attached hereto as Exhibit ``B.''
       Unfortunately, the Charge d'Affaires representations have 
     proven false. This office continued to receive reports from 
     service members and their families that overflights were not 
     occurring, that medicine was not being delivered, and that 
     negotiations were stalling. This induced subsequent demands 
     from this office to the government of Niger, through their 
     Charge d'Affaires, attached hereto as Exhibit ``C.''


      CURRENT CONDITIONS OF U.S. TROOPS IN NIGER--LACK OF MEDICINE

       The initial report detailed statements by several of the 
     USAF public-health leaders at Air Base 101. We reported then 
     that if additional supplies were not provided by May, several 
     key medicines would be unavailable. This has now come to 
     fruition. On May 2, 2024, one active-duty spouse wrote [``My 
     husband specifically is on cholesterol medication for his 
     heart and at this point in time he has run out of medication. 
     I mailed him a medication refill . . . that is currently 
     sitting in Germany because Niger still will not approve 
     flights.''] A copy of this spouse's correspondence is 
     attached hereto as Exhibit ``D.'' Lacking medicine has also 
     been a concern expressed by other family members, with 
     specificity (see below).
       As stated by another service member in Niger:
       Since two weeks ago we still have not received supplies, AB 
     101 is still short on blood and medications, here at 201 we 
     are mission parts that should have been here months ago. They 
     are struggling getting even MEdevac planes in for people that 
     need to be seen at a higher level of care . . . Why are we 
     still here?'' (See Exhibit ``E'')
       And another:
       ``The situation here at Air Base 101 and 201 (I'm here at 
     201) is a failure on the United States Government.'' We keep 
     getting told ``talks are good'' well if they are going good, 
     why have no planes come in for our replacements? . . . We 
     have not a resupply mission here since March. The morale here 
     is terrible and it needs to be fixed ASAP!'' (Exhibit ``F'')


                           EXTORTION TO LEAVE

       An FL-01 constituent and father of an active-duty service 
     member in Niger relayed to this office that local officials 
     are ``extorting passengers in order for them to bring luggage 
     through the airport.'' This account is confirmed by the 
     spouse of a military contractor currently stationed in Niger, 
     whose correspondence is attached as Exhibit ``G.''


                            RUSSIANS ON BASE

       The initial report alleged that Russian troops were allowed 
     onto U.S. installations in Niger. This is unprecedented and 
     dangerous. Reuters has now confirmed this claim, see Exhibit 
     ``H.'' This continues to be a source of safety concern for 
     our troops and their families.


                            RECOMMENDATIONS

       The Biden Administration must immediately resupply U.S. 
     troops in Niger. Our service members, contractors and their 
     families must not be allowed to be used as leverage by the 
     government of Niger or anyone else during a military 
     retrograde. Moreover, the Biden administration should not 
     spasm into a hasty retrograde which would leave hundreds of 
     millions of dollars in U.S. military material in the hands of 
     terrorists, militants, or Russians. The Biden administration 
     must fly in the needed water, medication supplies and troop 
     rotations, under fighter escort if necessary. If this does 
     not occur, the Biden administration has rendered these brave 
     Americans hostages of a hostile foreign regime.

evo-media-document/Part%20II%20Interim%20Report%20-
%20Unwelcome%20in%20Niger.pdf</a>.
  I rise to warn this body of the deteriorating conditions in the 
African country of Niger and to give rise to the concern of 
servicemembers and contractors.
  More than a thousand of them right now are functionally being held 
hostage in Niger. They are being used as pawns during a negotiation 
that has left America at the bended knee of Third World criminals and 
thugs as our troops seek medicine, freshwater, and troop rotations.
  How did we get here, with more than 1,100 Americans endangered right 
now in Niger? It started back in March 2023. Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken went to Niger and proclaimed that it was a model of resilience, 
a platform for great democracy. It would be where America would execute 
its Africa strategy.
  One year later, almost to the day, there was a coup in Niger. Guess 
who overthrew the government that we said was the great model of 
resilience? The people we trained. We trained the coup leaders to go 
throw out the democratically elected Government of Niger.
  I know this will surprise you, but after that occurred, they say they 
want our bases, which U.S. taxpayers have poured more than a billion 
dollars into, gone. They want our servicemembers gone.
  I came to this floor after hearing from some of my constituents who 
are stationed in Niger. After the overthrow of the government, there 
weren't resupply flights. They said: Congressman, we are going to be 
out of medicine in May if we don't get this sorted out.

                              {time}  1215

  Three days after I filed part I of the report that I am supplementing 
today, the Biden administration announced that we will be leaving 
Niger--a welcome sign, I am sure--but the leaving didn't actually 
happen. We have people who are now more than 200 days into a 180-day 
rotation.
  While the negotiation regarding retrograde and withdrawal are 
ongoing, the government in Niger is using the well-being and health of 
our servicemembers as leverage to get what they want out of our 
government. Our troops aren't getting medicine for malaria, 
cholesterol, blood pressure, and other chronic conditions.
  I have received letters from the wives and fathers of the people who 
are in Niger now, and they say: We know that our family members are 
being extorted by the local governments. When they try to leave, it is 
hundreds of dollars to even bring a bag through the airport. We know 
that Russians are behind the wire.
  Do you know what a real U.S. President would do? They would say that 
C-130s are on their way to Niger today with the water, medicine, and 
food that our troops need, that they will have a full fighter pilot 
escort there.
  If the Government of Niger or any other third-world thug tries to 
even turn on their air defense systems, we should show those leaders 
and those thugs what the target package looks like on their houses and 
their family members.
  It should not be Americans who are suffering because President Biden 
and Secretary Blinken are so embarrassed that their strategy in Africa 
failed that they are willing to let Americans' conditions deteriorate.
  They are willing to let our military spouses and family members 
wonder what is going to happen to their loved ones with their blood 
pressure rising and no blood pressure medication or be concerned about 
what will happen now that we are in May and there is not sufficient 
malaria medication. We should always keep our people's well-being at 
the forefront of our minds.
  Today, we should be resupplying our troops in Niger, Africa, and we 
should dare these thugs and criminals to mess with us while we are 
doing that. This is a total embarrassment, and saving politicians and 
people like Biden and Blinken from embarrassment is not worth putting 
U.S. troops at risk.
  I will stay on this. I will stay on our government and the Government 
of Niger to ensure that our military members and their families are 
appropriately treated, and their concerns are elevated to the highest 
levels of this House.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  Lord of the universe, look down upon Your people and grant us Your 
peace. From generation to generation, we have found ways to disparage 
and destroy one another, allowing racism, prejudice, and discrimination 
to color our judgment and enrage our worst selves.

[[Page H2840]]

  You have warned us that there will be wars and rumors of wars, nation 
will rise against nation. Earthquakes, famines, pestilence, and 
persecution will threaten our freedoms and dismantle our security.
  On this day of Holocaust remembrance, remind us that the insidious 
malice that crept into our culture and led to the horrific deaths of 
tens of millions, including Jews, Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses, gays, and 
the disabled, is an evil that is still at work today, pervading our 
communities.
  The present turmoil reveals a pivotal moment where You call us to 
bear testimony to our faithfulness to You and to You alone. In the 
words of Elie Wiesel: ``For the dead and the living, we must bear 
witness.''
  Grant us courage, and unite us under the values of dignity, respect, 
justice, and righteousness that when we reflect on history's 
extermination of entire peoples, we would affirm that never again means 
now.
  In the strength of Your name we pray.
  Amen.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL UNDER THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE 
 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD RELATING TO ``STANDARD FOR DETERMINING 
JOINT EMPLOYER STATUS''--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
                      STATES (H. DOC. NO. 118-135)

  The SPEAKER laid before the House the following veto message from the 
President of the United States:

To the House of Representatives:
  I am returning herewith without my approval H.J. Res. 98, a 
resolution that would disapprove of the National Labor Relations 
Board's (NLRB) rule entitled ``Standard for Determining Joint Employer 
Status.''
  Since day one, my Administration has fought to strengthen workers' 
right to organize and bargain for higher wages, better benefits, and 
safer working conditions. The NLRB's rule would prevent companies from 
evading their bargaining obligations or liability when they control a 
worker's working condition--even if they reserve such control or 
exercise it indirectly through a subcontractor or other intermediary. 
If multiple companies control the terms and conditions of employment, 
then the right to organize is rendered futile whenever the workers 
cannot bargain collectively with each of those employers.
  Without the NLRB's rule, companies could more easily avoid liability 
simply by manipulating their corporate structure, like hiding behind 
subcontractors or staffing agencies. By hampering the NLRB's efforts to 
promote the practice and procedure of collective bargaining, 
Republicans are siding with union-busting corporations over the needs 
of workers and their unions. I am proud to be the most pro-union, pro-
worker President in American history. I make no apologies for my 
Administration protecting the right to organize and bargain 
collectively.
  Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
                                          The White House, May 3, 2024.

  The SPEAKER. The objections of the President will be spread at large 
upon the Journal and the veto message and the joint resolution will be 
printed as a House document.
  Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that further 
consideration of the veto message and the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 
98, be postponed until the legislative day of May 7, 2024.
  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from 
Alabama?
  There was no objection.

                SECURING CHAIN OF COMMAND CONTINUITY ACT

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6972) to amend title 5, United States Code, to require an 
Executive agency whose head is a member of the National Security 
Council to notify the Executive Office of the President, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, and congressional leadership 
of such head becoming medically incapacitated within 24 hours, and for 
other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

[[Page H2841]]

  


                               H.R. 6972

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Chain of Command

     is known or may be reasonably assumed, the person serving or 
     who will be serving in an acting capacity as such head or, if 
     no person is or will be so acting, the first assistant to the

     person serving in an acting capacity as such head or, if no 
     person is so acting, the first assistant to the office of 
     such head, shall submit to the appropriate Federal officials

                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, like many of you, I was shocked this past February when 
Congress learned that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was medically 
incapacitated for days before the President or congressional leaders 
were made aware.
  The lack of transparency set off alarm bells on both sides of the 
aisle and across the national security community.
  We are experiencing crises across the world, crises that require our 
defense leadership to be alert and ready.
  Unfortunately, our defense leadership was not ready earlier this 
year. Secretary Austin was incapacitated, and no one knew.
  In these times, we cannot afford to be caught so unprepared. That is 
why this bill is an important measure to ensure military readiness.
  The Securing the Chain of Command Continuity Act requires 
congressional and Presidential notification when someone who is a 
member of the National Security Council and is the head of an executive 
agency becomes medically incapacitated.
  Under the bill, the person filling in for the incapacitated official 
must send the proper notifications within 24 hours of the official's 
medical incapacitation.
  If the proper notifications are not provided, a report detailing why 
the notification rules were not followed must be sent to Congress, the 
President, and the Comptroller General within 72 hours. This is a 
measured and balanced solution to this national security issue.
  I thank my colleagues, Representative Kiggans of Virginia and 
Representative Davis of North Carolina, for their bipartisan work on 
this important and timely legislation.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LaTurner for his excellent introduction. I 
rise also in support of H.R. 6927, which would amend the Federal 
Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 to require any agency head who is a member 
of the National Security Council to notify the executive office of the 
President, GAO, and congressional leadership within 24 hours in the 
event of medical incapacity.
  This bill was brought forth after the hospitalization several months 
ago of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to treat complications from 
cancer surgery.
  Secretary Austin has taken responsibility for the lack of 
notification to the President during his hospitalization and has 
assured the American people that ``there were no gaps in authorities 
and no risks to the Department's command and control'' during his 
absence.
  A congressional hearing on the topic in February confirmed as much, 
and a classified review found no ``ill intent'' by the Secretary's 
staff.
  I commend the Biden administration for the swift action it took to 
conduct a thorough review of current protocols and to ensure that the 
Office of the President receives all proper notifications. This bill 
aligns with the Biden administration's efforts in the field.
  Consistent with the spirit of transparency embodied in the 25th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which requires congressional leadership 
to be notified if the President is unable to discharge the duties of 
his or her office, I agree that Congress should be notified if an 
agency head who is a member of the NSC is similarly incapacitated.
  I support this legislation, I congratulate Secretary Austin on his 
recovery, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin for his comments.
  I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans).
  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to 
speak in support of my legislation, the Securing the Chain of Command 
Continuity Act.
  At a time when our Nation is facing threats around the world, we 
cannot afford for those who are critical to America's national security 
to disappear without explanation and a clear delegation of their 
responsibilities.
  As someone who served in the Armed Forces for nearly 10 years, I was 
alarmed by reports back in January that those at the highest levels in 
the chain of command were not informed when Secretary of Defense Austin 
required an unexpected leave of absence due to health challenges.
  For days, essential members of the National Security Council, 
including the President, were left in the dark regarding his status, 
causing a serious breach of command and control that is the bedrock of 
America's defense supremacy.

[[Page H2842]]

  I am concerned for Secretary Austin's health and wish him well. 
However, the Department of Defense's lack of transparency surrounding 
his absence is very concerning.
  Critical communication breakdowns like these could have disastrous 
results and put our men and women in uniform at risk.
  To ensure America remains capable of combating threats wherever and 
whenever they occur, we not only need an unparalleled fighting force 
but also a strong chain of command among our military's leadership that 
cannot be compromised.
  That is why I introduced the Securing the Chain of Command Continuity 
Act alongside my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Congressman 
Davis of North Carolina, to prevent any similar chain of command 
breakdowns in the future and preserve the integrity of our national 
security.

  My bipartisan legislation would amend existing law to require all 
members of the National Security Council to notify the executive office 
of the President, the Comptroller General of the United States, and to 
each Chamber of Congress within 24 hours of any planned or emergent 
medical incapacitation.
  In the event this notification does not occur, a comprehensive report 
must be submitted providing transparency surrounding the incapacitation 
and related notification failure within 30 days.
  At a time when our servicemembers are facing lethal attacks from our 
adversaries overseas, my bill will help ensure continuous chain of 
command so that our military and national defense systems can operate 
seamlessly in case of an emergency and achieve mission success.
  It is my goal in Congress to advance legislation that protects our 
country, our citizens, and our men and women in uniform.
  That is why I drafted this national security bill in a way that all 
commonsense Members can support, no matter which side of the aisle they 
are on.
  I was pleased when the Securing the Chain of Command Continuity Act 
was passed unanimously out of the House Oversight Committee in 
February, proving just how nonpartisan this effort is. I thank 
Congressman Davis of North Carolina for his partnership with me on this 
critical issue.
  The world is a dangerous place. We can't afford a lack of 
transparency from our senior military leaders. We must preserve the 
integrity of our national security, and I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will keep our 
country and our military men and women safe.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Davis).
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
Raskin for yielding time.
  I rise in support of H.R. 6972, the Securing Chain of Command 
Continuity Act. As a proud United States Air Force veteran, I join my 
colleague, Representative Kiggans of Virginia, who also served our 
country in uniform, to introduce this bipartisan bill.
  If we have learned anything from the past several months, it is, 
indeed, we are in a more dangerous world. As tensions and threats rise 
across the globe, timely responses are vital to safeguarding the 
American people and saving lives.
  Congress must require National Security Council agencies to provide a 
notice of the incapacitation of their agency heads within 24 hours. 
That is reasonable.
  This requirement for our Nation's leaders is a minimum expectation to 
ensure transparency and accountability. The American people deserve 
nothing less, and I support the legislation.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina 
for his eloquent remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden), my friend.
  Mr. VAN ORDEN. Mr. Speaker, I spent over 25 years in the United 
States military. I designed elements from as large as a SEAL team down 
to a small tactical unit.
  The first thing that you establish is something called CCIRs, 
Commander's Critical Information Requirements, and the first one is: 
Where is the commander? Is the commander in place and able to make 
decisions?
  Unfortunately, the most powerful Department of Defense in the history 
of the world, led by Lloyd Austin, failed to do the most simple task 
that is required of any commander, and that is to inform the Commander 
in Chief of his presence.
  This, to me, is another sign of an incredibly incompetent Department 
of Defense and the Biden administration's inability to lead and protect 
this Nation.
  I am so thankful that my colleagues across the aisle have identified 
this also, and they know that the Biden administration must be held 
accountable for their lack of leadership in protecting the United 
States of America.
  It is unquestionable that the world is a much more dangerous place 
under the Biden administration and under Secretary Austin's leadership 
of the Department of Defense.
  Again, I thank my colleagues from across the aisle for this 
bipartisan effort to hold the Biden administration accountable and to 
make sure that any member of the National Security Council who is 
incapable of performing their duties is informing the President in a 
timely manner.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I 
am prepared to close.
  Mr. Speaker, we had such a nice bipartisan spirit going. I almost 
want to bite my tongue, but I do have to respond to the last speaker 
who took a gratuitous shot at President Biden and the Biden 
administration, which has moved very quickly to get behind this 
legislation and to address this gap in the law.
  We do need to always establish the chain of command, and we need to 
know, as the gentleman from Wisconsin was saying, where is the 
Commander in Chief? Where is the leader?
  That was the question everybody was asking on January 6 when this 
institution, this body, came under brutal, merciless attack by a mob 
incited by the former President.
  Nearly 150 of our police officers were wounded, brutalized, and 
hospitalized in that attack, and everybody was asking this very 
question the gentleman from Wisconsin was asking, which is: Where is 
the Commander in Chief? Where is the leader? Where is the National 
Guard?
  I am sorry to have to make that refutation of the last interjection 
by the gentleman from Wisconsin. Again, I thank Mr. LaTurner for the 
bipartisan spirit with which he brings this legislation forward, and I 
strongly support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We 
were so close, Mr. Speaker. So close.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my House colleagues to support this 
commonsense government transparency bill to address a relevant national 
security concern.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6972, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.

                              {time}  1615


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, the Information Quality 
Assurance Act. Each year, thousands of regulations are imposed as an 
added burden on the American public. The Code of Federal Regulations, 
in which these rules are housed, spans 243 volumes that contain over 
180,000 single-spaced pages. Agency guidance explaining these 
regulations to the public likely spans millions more pages.
  If we must have rules imposed by Federal regulatory agencies, we 
should, at the very least, ensure that regulatory agencies rely on the 
best available information. Unfortunately, agencies frequently do not 
rely on the best available information to create their regulations.
  Year after year, the Federal courts are clogged with litigation 
brought by regulated parties who point out that Federal agencies have 
acted based on flawed information. Over the years, Congress has tried 
to improve the situation.
  In 2000, Congress enacted the Information Quality Act, which charged 
the Office of Management and Budget and each Federal agency to adopt 
guidelines to ensure agencies rely on high-quality information.
  In 2015, Congress enacted the Foundations of Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act, expanding on the Information Quality Act to further 
ensure agencies use high-quality information.
  Still, disputes continue to arise over whether regulators are basing 
their decisions on the best quality information available. Every year, 
courts strike down agency rules that do not rely on adequate 
information. Every year, agency guidance that does not rely on the best 
information forces regulated parties down pathways that do not make 
sense.
  The Information Quality Assurance Act takes several major but 
straightforward steps to solve that problem. For the first time, it 
requires that the information on which agencies rest their rules and 
guidance be the best reasonably available information. It also includes 
several additional terms to make sure agencies are finally held to that 
standard.
  This legislation will improve the quality of agency decisionmaking, 
improve the acceptability of new rules and guidance, and avoid the need 
for many disputes over agencies' use of information to go to court.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank 
Representative McClain and Representative Porter for their work on this 
important bipartisan legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comment Integrity and 
Management Act.
  Technological advances have expanded access to Federal agencies' 
online rulemaking dockets and have made it easier for the public to 
comment on proposed rules. That is a very

[[Page H2844]]

good thing from the standpoint of transparency, accountability, and 
deliberation.
  At the same time, in some recent high-profile rulemakings, agencies 
have received an extraordinarily high volume of completely duplicative 
comments, which has created some challenges for agencies in processing 
them and managing their online rulemaking dockets.
  I am sure Members are familiar with receiving a standardized message 
hundreds or even thousands of times from constituents or people across 
the country.
  This bill is designed to help agencies manage such mass comments and 
computer-generated comments submitted in response to proposed rules. It 
is not intended in any way to discourage mass comments, which are 
indeed a vital part of the regulatory process. The bill would simply 
allow agencies to post a representative sample of mass comments. If 
they choose to do that, they would also be required to post the 
number--hold that thought, if you would, Mr. Speaker. I was describing 
the next bill. Forgive me. We got our papers confused here. Keep that 
in mind. I like that one, too.
  The Information Quality Assurance Act is bipartisan legislation 
introduced by Representatives Porter and McClain. I commend them for 
their work on it.
  It would require the Director of OMB to update guidance issued under 
the Information Quality Act. That guidance is more than 20 years old, 
and much work has been done by Congress and the executive branch on 
these issues in the interim. The Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, the 
DATA Act, and the OPEN Government Act are just a few new laws requiring 
updated guidance.
  Updated guidance would enable agencies to better ensure the quality 
of information and evidence used in promulgating regulations. The new 
guidance would ensure that the best reasonably available scientific, 
demographic, economic, financial, and statistical information is relied 
on during the regulatory process.
  The bill also continues the practices of the Information Quality Act 
that allow for public input on the information submitted and mechanisms 
for OMB to report any complaints to Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working closely with us and the 
administration in crafting this bill. The result is strong, and I fully 
support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making that 
mistake so that when I make it here in a few bills, it will be easier 
for me.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
McClain).
  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 7219, 
the Information Quality Assurance Act. I also thank Representative 
Katie Porter for partnering with me on this important piece of 
legislation.

  From my time in business, I can tell you that American employers and 
workers cannot afford for the Federal Government to impose new 
regulations and guidance on them that are misinformed, misconceived, 
and, quite frankly, backed by bad data.
  Regulations like that only harm the American people. They needlessly 
drain employers' resources, kill jobs, and cede economic victory to 
America's other competitors, like China.
  The same can be said of ill-informed and ill-conceived agency 
guidance. When an agency's guidance rests on flawed information, it 
risks sending regulated parties and their resources down rabbit holes 
just to avoid the threat of misguided agency enforcement actions.
  One of the most important ways we can make sure the Federal 
Government does not issue ill-informed regulations and guidance is 
also, quite frankly, one of the simplest. It is to require that Federal 
regulators base new regulations and guidance on the best reasonably 
available information.
  My Information Quality Assurance Act does just that. It requires 
three simple things.
  First and foremost, it requires agencies to use the best data 
possible in drafting regulations. This includes data on the impacts the 
regulation will have on the American people.
  Second, it requires the agency to make public, in a timely fashion, 
any model, methodology, or source of scientific, technical, 
demographic, economic, or statistical information which it intends to 
utilize in its rulemaking.
  Third, it makes sure the public has a chance to question whether that 
information is the best that is reasonably available.
  With these three simple commonsense reforms, we can make sure the 
Federal regulatory system avoids a mountain of mistakes that would 
unfairly burden the American people. That is what our job in Congress 
truly is: making the government more efficient so that we can help the 
most people.
  By making these three simple changes to how agencies utilize data, we 
can achieve that simple goal and make life better for people in this 
country.
  It is clear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree. This 
bill passed through the Oversight Committee--be careful to listen for 
it--with unanimous bipartisan support. That is the kind of thing this 
country needs right now.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lead this bipartisan bill to improve the 
way our government works for generations to come, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  Despite the fact that I didn't know we were on this bill originally, 
we are in very strong and unanimous support on our side of the aisle 
for this, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill 
to ensure that agencies rely on the best reasonably available 
information to create their regulations.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7219, as amended.

              COMMENT INTEGRITY AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2024

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7528) to amend section 206 of the E-Government Act of 2002 
to improve the integrity and management of mass comments and computer-
generated comments in the regulatory review process, and for other 
purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7528

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Comment Integrity and 
     Management Act of 2024''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

        The purpose of this Act is to help Federal agencies manage 
     mass and computer-generated comments in the Federal 
     regulatory process. This should in no way be understood to 
     discourage mass comments, which are a vital part of the 
     regulatory process.

     SEC. 3. IMPROVING INTEGRITY AND MANAGEMENT OF MASS COMMENTS 
                   AND COMPUTER-GENERATED COMMENTS IN THE 
                   REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS.

       (a) In General.-- Section 206 of the E-Government Act of 
     2002 (Public Law 107-347; 44 U.S.C. 3501 note) is amended 
     by--
       (1) redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and
       (2) inserting after subsection (d) the following:
       ``(e) Information Integrity.--
       ``(1) Verification of electronic submissions.--With respect 
     to each comment accepted by electronic means under subsection 
     (c), in accordance with the guidance established by Director 
     in paragraph (3), the head of an agency shall verify, to the 
     greatest extent possible, at the time the comment is 
     submitted, whether the comment has been submitted by a human 
     being.
       ``(2) Identification and management of mass comments.--

     whether such comment is a mass comment; and
       ``(ii) in the case that the agency has made a reasonable 
     determination that the comment is a mass comment, indicate on 
     any publicly available copy of the comment, or comment 
     variations, (through a label or indicator, and in a machine 
     and human readable format) that the comment is part of a mass 
     comment submission; and
       ``(B) Handling of mass comments.--Notwithstanding 
     subsection (d)(2)(A), instead of making available through the 
     electronic docket of the agency each comment identified as a 
     mass comment under paragraph (2), the head of an agency may--
       ``(i) make available through such docket only a single 
     representative sample of each such mass comment; or

     variations on certain standardized but not identical language 
     the agency make available through such docket a single copy 
     of one of the variations of the mass comment.

     an agency makes available through such docket a single 
     representative sample or a single copy of one of the 
     variations of a mass comment under subparagraph (B), the head 
     of the agency shall indicate (through a label or indicator, 
     and in a machine and human readable format), on the sample or 
     copy made available, the number of submissions that were 
     determined to be identical, or substantively identical to the 
     sample or copy made available on such docket.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Every American deserves the opportunity to participate in our 
political system, which includes sharing their views on agency 
rulemaking.
  Agencies are required to provide an opportunity to participate in 
rulemaking by submitting written views or data on draft rules.
  Recent advances have expanded the ability for the public to comment 
on proposed rules electronically. However, agencies may struggle to 
manage computer-generated or mass comments.
  H.R. 7528, the Comment Integrity and Management Act, provides 
additional support to agencies navigating these new challenges by 
allowing them the flexibility necessary to manage electronic comments.
  The bill requires agencies to verify that any comment submitted 
electronically has been submitted by an actual human. The bill also 
provides agencies with additional authorities to assist in processing 
and analyzing mass comments submitted electronically.
  It requires agencies to identify, to the extent practicable, if the 
comment is a mass comment and indicate this identification on any 
publicly available copy of the comment.
  This bill also requires agencies to establish and make public any 
policies

[[Page H2846]]

they have regarding how they will handle computer-generated and mass 
comments in the rulemaking process.
  Further, this legislation requires the Office of Management and 
Budget to issue implementing guidance to agencies and requires the 
Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress.
  It is time that our Federal agencies adapt their processes to 
accommodate the latest technologies.
  I thank Representative Clay Higgins for his idea and work in 
developing this forward-thinking legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in support of the Comment Integrity and Management Act again, 
as I was saying. I was very eager to support my friend Mr. Higgins' 
legislation here.
  The basic issue is that it has gotten easier for people to post 
comments online in a rulemaking. That is a really good thing because it 
means that the process of implementing regulations is more accessible, 
more transparent, more open, and more participatory, but a number of 
the agencies have found, I think, what Members of Congress have found. 
Sometimes you get the same paragraph 100 times, 1,000 times, or 3,000 
times.
  This bill would simply allow agencies to post a representative sample 
of mass comments like this. If they choose to do that, they still are 
required to post the number of such comments received so that the 
volume of public sentiment is still fairly and effectively registered.
  The bill would also require agencies, within 1 year, to establish 
policies for handling computer-generated comments, which is a growing 
concern to manage with the recent remarkable advances in artificial 
intelligence.
  I am eager to hear from Mr. Higgins because I view his legislation as 
one that supports the administrative rulemaking process, which is so 
much under attack these days. There are people who say that we 
shouldn't have rules and regulations. Of course, the way our system 
works is that, in Congress, we pass laws like the Clean Air Act and the 
Clean Water Act, but we don't get into all the fine details. That is 
left to the executive branch to do a rulemaking. That, too, is an open 
process where people can register their concerns and send comments in.
  We want to make sure that that process continues to operate 
effectively and is not overwhelmed and overburdened by AI and computer-
duplicated comments.

                              {time}  1630

  So I thank Mr. Higgins, and I thank Chairman Comer and his staff for 
working with our side to address some of the concerns we had with the 
original language.
  I understand the administration and some outside groups have also 
registered some concerns about the legislation that have been 
addressed. We have worked with them and our majority counterparts to 
incorporate their feedback into this revised version of the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the bill at this time, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Kansas for yielding. I appreciate the commentary of my friend and 
colleague, the ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability 
Committee, Representative Raskin.
  It may interest you to know, Mr. Speaker, that Representative Raskin 
and I have worked in the spirit of mutual respect and camaraderie for 8 
years now. We have enjoyed many vigorous debates in this body, and I 
find it encouraging that he has risen enthusiastically now twice in 
support of my bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7528, the Comment Integrity 
and Management Act. This bill is essential in the digital age where our 
constituents engage with us more and more through electronic means. It 
seeks to safeguard citizens' First Amendment right to participate in 
the Federal rulemaking process.
  This participation includes the invaluable process of submitting 
public comments on proposed Federal rules and regulations, comments 
that help shape the very fabric of our government.
  With the advent of digital technology and the rise of artificial 
intelligence being of increasing import, the channels for such 
participation have expanded providing broader access but also 
introducing new challenges. These challenges include computer-generated 
comments which can obscure genuine public input and hinder our 
agencies' ability to gauge public sentiment effectively.
  The cornerstone of this bill is its commitment to ensuring that every 
comment submitted by electronic means comes from a real person, not an 
automated program. By requiring human verification, we are taking a 
significant step towards preserving the authenticity of public input.
  Furthermore, the Comment Integrity and Management Act equips our 
agencies with the flexibility and tools necessary to efficiently manage 
the comments they receive. This includes the authority to identify and 
process computer-generated and mass comments, ensuring that they are 
handled transparently and effectively.
  Additionally, the legislation directs the Office of Management and 
Budget to issue guidance on best practices for managing electronic 
comments and mandates a report for the United States Government 
Accountability Office on the prevalence and impact of computer-
generated comments.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of 
adapting our processes to the realities of the 21st century. It is 
imperative that we ensure every American is heard and that genuine 
public input is not drowned out by the noise of automation.
  This bill represents a good government approach to embracing 
technological advancements while safeguarding the principles of public 
participation and transparency in the rulemaking process.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to salute the distinguished 
gentleman from Louisiana for making the administrative rulemaking 
process up-to-date, rapid, transparent, and effective for all of us so 
we can keep it going.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. In closing, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7528 helps ensure every 
American is heard and not drowned out by an influx of computer-
generated comments.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this necessary 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7528, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7527

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of

  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7527, which requires U.S. 
Postal Service employees and contractors to report traffic crashes that 
result in injury or death to the Postal Service.
  Last year, The Wall Street Journal published an article alleging that 
the Postal Service contracted with low-cost trucking companies that did 
not follow highway safety regulations. They also reported that postal 
contractors have been involved in car crashes that have killed 79 
people in the last 3 years.
  To conduct oversight of this important topic, Congress needs to be 
informed. The Mail Traffic Deaths Reporting Act requires the Postal 
Service to report to Congress any traffic crashes that result in injury 
or death.
  Under the bill, Postal Service employees and contractors will have 3 
days to report a traffic accident to the Postal Service. These reports 
will include, at minimum, the date, time, location, nature of the 
crash, information identifying the contractor, and number of injuries 
and fatalities. The Postal Service will maintain a comprehensive 
internal digital database of this information.
  The Postal Service is also required to compile a publicly available 
report summarizing annual stats related to injuries and deaths from 
traffic accidents.
  I thank Representative Connolly and House Oversight and 
Accountability Committee Chairman   James Comer for bringing this 
necessary legislation to the consideration of the House.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation introduced 
by Mr. Connolly.
  Between 2021 and 2023, truck drivers contracted by the Postal Service 
were involved in at least 68 different traffic accidents, and 79 people 
were killed in them.
  On February 27, 2024, the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector 
General found that the Postal Service failed to record all mail 
transport accidents in a central database, including accidents 
involving truck driver contractors. As a result, the Postal Service 
failed to have a complete understanding of traffic accidents and the 
comprehensive safety performance of its mail transport drivers.
  With this new information from the inspector general, it is clear 
that the level of fatalities across this period could even have been 
higher.
  The Mail Traffic Deaths Reporting Act, the excellent bill brought 
forward by Mr. Connolly, would resolve these serious oversight 
deficiencies by increasing transparency, comprehension, and 
understanding of the full scale of mail transport accidents and 
ultimately improve safety for postal transport drivers and for the 
public. The bill would require all Postal Service mail transport 
drivers, including 4,600 postal trucking contractors, to adhere to a 
range of reporting, tracking, and accountability measures.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Subcommittee Ranking Member Gerry Connolly from 
Virginia for his great leadership in strengthening Postal Service mail 
transport safety, and I am pleased to support this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Connolly).
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Maryland, the 
distinguished ranking member, for yielding, and the Republican manager 
from Kansas.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill, the Mail Traffic 
Deaths Reporting Act. This necessary bill which I am co-leading with my 
distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Oversight and 
Accountability Committee, Mr. Comer, has strong, bipartisan support. It 
passed through our committee 40-0.
  I am thrilled that the chairman and I could partner, write, and 
introduce the Mail Traffic Deaths Reporting Act, which requires the 
United States Postal Service to collect, track, and report on serious 
crashes and fatalities involving vehicles transporting U.S. postal 
mail.
  The chairman and I have both met with the families of truck crash 
victims. We have heard their painful stories and are committed to 
stopping preventable tragedies involving mail transport. These 
families-turned-advocates welcome this legislation which is

endorsed by the Truck Safety Coalition.
  In June of 2022, the Godines family was traveling back to their home 
in Gillette, Wyoming. Traveling behind the family on I-25 as they 
passed Greeley, Colorado, was a contract freight truck carrying U.S. 
mail on a U.S. Postal Service contract.
  The truck's brakes were out of alignment, it was uninsured, and its 
driver had no commercial driver's license. When that truck carrying 
U.S. delivery material slammed into the back of the Godines' family 
vehicle, in an instant, Mr. Speaker, three generations of Godines were 
killed. They lost their lives, including a 3-month old baby, Tessleigh. 
Safety concerns about the freight contract trucking practices at the 
Postal Service have been increasing ever since.
  Between 2020 and 2023, as has been noted, at least 79 people have 
been killed in crashes involving trucks contracted by the Postal 
Service. The true number is higher because just last year we learned 
that the Postal Service did not report serious crashes involving 
its trucking contractors.

  That revelation raised serious questions about safety oversight by 
the USPS involving their contracted vehicles, including the troubling 
allegation that the Postal Service is managing truck freight operations 
which do not adhere to legal and commonsense safety standards.
  The Postal Service has, for example, set delivery schedules requiring 
drivers to exceed hours of service requirements and has selected 
carriers with extensive records of safety violations. It looks like 
there is no vetting of these contractors at all.
  Between December of 2020 and December of 2022, the Department of 
Transportation identified a frightening 466 Postal Service trucking 
contractors that had high rates of violations related to driving hours. 
In 2021 and 2022, 39 percent of trucking companies carrying U.S. mail 
by contract violated rules meant to prevent driver exhaustion and did 
so repeatedly. Between 2017 and 2022, one single trucking group 
contracted by USPS had broken those rules 200 times-plus.
  When I asked the Postal Service for the number of deaths involved in 
the contracted transport of mail, the Postal Service said that they 
didn't have that information because they did not collect, monitor, or 
report such information.
  Imagine that comfort to grieving families.
  That was until, of course, May of 2023 when I asked the Inspector 
General of the U.S. Postal Service to look into this issue and, all of 
a sudden, the Postal Service responded by establishing an ad hoc 
centralized reporting mechanism for serious and deadly crashes 
involving postal freight contractors.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the ``Contract Trucking Safety 
and Compliance Report.''

                            Findings Summary

       We found that the Postal Service's highway trucking 
     contract safety controls, contract compliance, and screening 
     oversight were not always effective. First, the Postal 
     Service did not track contractor accidents and fatalities. 
     Second, the Postal Service did not always develop appropriate 
     safety requirements, provide adequate oversight, or enforce 
     the terms and conditions of the contracts or freight auction 
     Ordering Agreements.
       Lastly, the Postal Service's screening processes did not 
     always include a contract trucker's driving history. These 
     collective deficiencies hindered visibility into safety 
     performance and could compromise the safety and security of 
     the mail and motorists.


 Finding #1: The Postal Service Does Not track trucking accidents and 
                       fatalities by contractors

       The Postal Service did not tract trucking contractor 
     accidents and fatalities and therefore, we could not 
     determine the total number of occurrences. We analyzed 
     incident data between October 2018 and December 2022 tracked 
     on the DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
     (FMCSA) website to help assess Postal Service contract 
     trucker safety performance. This list does not contain all 
     contractors utilized by the Postal Service as FMCSA does not 
     track company safety data separately. However, we were able 
     to identify at least 373 accidents resulting in 89 fatalities 
     that were directly related to 43 on-duty contractors 
     servicing Postal Service truck contracts. These 43 
     contractors were associated with Postal Service contracts 
     totaling about $1.34 bi11ion between October 2018 and 
     December 2022. We determined that the Postal Service had not 
     terminated any contracts with trucking companies involved in 
     accidents or fatalities prior to March 2023.
       The Postal Service was unable to provide statistics and 
     information on incidents (e.g., frequency, location, time, or 
     involved parties) as it did not monitor FMCSA or have a 
     system for recording or tracking related contractor data. 
     However, when accidents or fatalities occur on trucking 
     routes contracted with the Postal Service, contractors are 
     required to report incident data to Postal Service 
     contracting personnel. As stated earlier, Postal Service 
     policy also requires AOs to report accident information to 
     the Postal Inspection Service. Despite these reporting 
     requirements, there is no centralized collection of 
     information concerning these incidents. Postal Service 
     officials acknowledged the lack of such a system, noting that 
     tracking this data was not previously required by Postal 
     Service policy or procedures.
       The Postal Service has recently started to track this 
     information. In March 2023, the Vice President, 
     Transportation Strategy, stated that all traffic accidents 
     involving contract trucking drivers be reported directly to 
     him and the appropriate CO. This directive; however, was not 
     recorded in written policy. In June 2023, the Postal Service 
     stated they have an existing platform that could be used for 
     storing contract trucking safety data. However, as of 
     November 2023, the Postal Service has not created 
     corresponding policies governing the use of this system 
     (including related roles, responsibilities, and procedures) 
     to record contract trucking safety data.
       The Postal Service is however, taking other actions to 
     monitor, assess, and potentially act on contractor safety 
     data. First, it hired outside experts to review changes in 
     the suppliers' safety ratings, create a list of suppliers to 
     avoid, and determine suppliers' insurance coverage risk. 
     Second, it is working to establish new contract trucking 
     processes and procedures to improve the quality of 
     contractors, including the removal of contractors with a 
     conditional safety rating. Collectively, these actions would 
     better inform the Postal Service when making decisions to 
     either (a) choose a contractor based on their safety 
     performance or (b) take appropriate termination or other 
     corrective actions in instances of poor safety performance.
       However even with these actions, the lack of a finalized 
     method and established policies to track and monitor 
     contractor accident and fatality data in the existing safety 
     database limits the Postal Service's visibility into 
     contractor safety performance. This deficiency could allow 
     unsafe drivers to transport mail and put other motorists at 
     risk.
       Recommendation #1:
       We recommend the Vice President, Transportation Strategy, 
     finalize the method for tracking contractor accident and 
     fatality data and establish corresponding written policies 
     and procedures, including related roles and responsibilities.


      Finding #2: Lack of Subcontractor and Team Driver Oversight

       The Postal Service lacked requirements and clear policies 
     or did not always enforce the terms and conditions of the 
     contracts or freight auction Ordering Agreements to promote 
     safe highway trucking practices. We found the following 
     deficiencies:
       Lack of Visibility in Subcontractor Use. The Postal Service 
     did not always know who was authorized to transport the mail 
     on its behalf. Freight auction brokers were not required to 
     obtain prior written approval or inform the Postal Service of 
     the specific contractors being utilized. Instead, the Postal 
     Service relied on the broker to complete subcontractor 
     authorization and vet the subcontractor, but those results 
     are not required to be reported to the Postal Service. The 
     onus is on the broker to ensure the subcontractor is in 
     compliance with Postal Service policies.
       Specific to HCR contracts, per the procurement handbook, 
     contractors should specify their intent to subcontract route 
     operations during contract award and disclose any subsequent 
     subcontractor additions. Further, if a contractor wants to 
     use additional subcontractors, Postal Service policy states 
     this is an exceptional action and should be approved only 
     when the contractor can offer sufficient reasons for the 
     change. HCR contract terms and conditions also require the 
     contractor to fully disclose subcontractor relationships as 
     part of its proposal.
       However, of the 15 COs and AOs interviewed, 14 (93 percent) 
     did not know when HeR contractors utilized a subcontractor. 
     Furthermore, HCR contractors must obtain prior written 
     approval from the CO to employ subcontractors. However, six 
     of the seven COs we interviewed were not aware of this 
     requirement and therefore did not have the required 
     documentation. Instead, the Postal Service relied on the HCR 
     contractor to determine when to use a subcontractor and to 
     ensure the subcontractor adhered to the terms and conditions 
     including safety requirements. Using subcontractors without 
     the prior written approval of the CO is a major irregularity 
     for which the contractor may be terminated without notice or 
     warning. However, while the SPs and Ps require approval from 
     the CO before subcontracting, it does not state that approval 
     needs to be written.

  Mr. CONNOLLY. As the USPS OIG stated in a report released this past 
March, while it is a welcome step, the Postal Service still does not 
have a single written policy requiring the tracking of trucking 
contractor accidents and fatalities.

[[Page H2849]]

  The OIG's number one recommendation was that the Postal Service fix 
this serious safety oversight immediately, and that is what we are 
doing today.
  Our legislation would codify the number one recommendation of the 
OIG, to begin to improve USPS freight trucking safety and provide 
accountability.
  This bill will maintain an internal database, and I hope it will lead 
to reforms by the Postal Service and save lives.

                              {time}  1645

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Connolly) for the purposes of a colloquy.
  Mr. Connolly, is it the case that rules that would clearly apply to 
USPS trucks carrying postal mail have not been applied to the 
contractors?
  Mr. CONNOLLY. I think that is a fair conclusion.
  Mr. RASKIN. In other words, the postal truck drivers who are working 
for the Postal Service have to have all the proper licensure and all 
the proper certification and training. Presumably the brakes are 
checked on their trucks, but because of the contracting out, they 
somehow have been able to escape all the rules we have with respect to 
road safety?
  Mr. CONNOLLY. I think, again, that is a fair conclusion, Mr. Raskin.
  Mr. RASKIN. Well, again, I commend the gentleman for bringing this to 
public attention. That is an extraordinary number of people to lose 
their lives on the road to private contractors, who seem to have 
completely escaped the grasp of the rules that have been adopted under 
the Postal Service. Additionally, we know that the Postal Service 
traditionally has taken far more serious interest in public safety and 
public welfare.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Raskin, what is so troubling 
is these are 100 percent preventable tragedies. Not one of these lives 
had to be lost but for the callousness and lack of regard at the Postal 
Service in vetting freight contractors.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, this is excellent bipartisan legislation with Congress 
acting just as it should to address a serious public policy problem, 
and let's hope that we pass this quickly, the President signs it 
quickly, and we don't lose any more Americans or Postal Service workers 
on the road.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, the Postal Service is tasked with the challenging job of 
providing fast, reliable mail service nationwide. While they do so, 
their safety should be prioritized.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this 
commonsense bill that increases transparency into the Postal Service's 
safety record to improve public safety throughout our Nation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Higgins of Louisiana). The question is 
on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that 
the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7527, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                SPECIAL DISTRICT GRANT ACCESSIBILITY ACT

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7525) to require the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget to issue guidance to agencies requiring special districts to 
be recognized as local government for the purpose of Federal financial 
assistance determinations.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7525

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Special District Grant 
     Accessibility Act''.

     SEC. 2. AGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GUIDANCE ON SPECIAL 
                   DISTRICTS.

       (a) Requirements for Agency Acknowledgment of Special 
     Districts as Grant Recipients.--
       (1) OMB guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
     of the enactment of this Act, the Director shall issue 
     guidance that clarifies how an agency recognizes a special 
     district as a unit of local government for the purpose of 
     being eligible to receive Federal financial assistance.
       (2) Agency requirements.--Not later than 1 year after the 
     date on which the guidance is issued pursuant to paragraph 
     (1), the head of each agency shall implement the requirements 
     of such guidance and conform any policy, principle, practice, 
     procedure, or guideline relating to the administration of the 
     Federal financial assistance programs of the agency.
       (3) Reporting requirement.--Not later than 2 years after 
     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director shall

     evaluates agency implementation of and conformity to the 
     guidance issued pursuant to paragraph (1).
       (b) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given the 
     term in section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
       (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of 
     the Office of Management and Budget.
       (3) Federal financial assistance.--The term ``Federal

     and significant budgetary autonomy or control, created by or 
     pursuant to the laws of the State, for the purpose of 
     performing limited and specific governmental or proprietary 
     functions that distinguish it as a significantly separate 
     entity from the administrative governance structure of any 
     other form of local government unit within a State.
       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several 
     States, the District of Columbia, each commonwealth, 
     territory, or possession of the United States, and each 
     federally recognized Indian Tribe.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7525, which establishes a 
definition in law for special districts and clarifies that special 
districts are eligible to receive Federal financial assistance.
  Many Americans receive essential services through special districts, 
units of local government authorized under State law to deliver 
specific services to communities. There are approximately 35,000 
special districts across the country in every single State.
  Some examples of special districts are ambulance service districts, 
drainage districts, emergency service boards, and flood control 
districts, to name a few. These special districts provide critical 
services to mostly rural communities across the Nation.
  The Office of Management and Budget already recognizes special 
districts as units of local government, similar to townships or 
villages, yet special districts often struggle to compete for or access 
Federal funding.
  The Special District Grant Accessibility Act works to solve this 
problem and ensures that special districts are on equal footing with 
other units of local government. This bill requires the Office of 
Management and Budget to issue guidance to Federal agencies, 
emphasizing how special districts should be recognized as a unit of 
local government.
  This legislation is supported by the National Special Districts 
Coalition.

[[Page H2850]]

  I thank Representative Fallon and Representative Pettersen for their 
work on this important bipartisan bill, which impacts nearly every 
congressional district in our Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill and 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7525.
  The Special District Grant Accessibility Act is a bipartisan measure 
that takes a positive step forward toward ensuring that Federal policy 
better reflects the complexities of local governments and how they 
work.
  Congress confronted these complexities when it acted to send aid to 
local governments during the coronavirus pandemic. This included 
committee Democrats' historic work with the Biden-Harris administration 
to provide $350 billion in direct financial assistance to more than 
30,000 governments across the country, the vast majority of which were 
small local governments, and many of whom received significant 
assistance for the first time.
  This bill would provide further clarity around special districts, a 
special unit of local government. According to the National Special 
Districts Coalition, there are roughly 35,000 such special districts 
across the Nation that play an important role in delivering essential 
government services, like wastewater treatment and fire protection, to 
millions of Americans.
  Special districts have reported challenges when trying to access 
Federal funding opportunities and have indicated that a unified Federal 
definition of ``special district'' would help clarify how entities can 
best assist local communities through Federal assistance programs.
  To address these concerns, H.R. 7525 would codify a definition of the 
term and direct OMB to clarify how Federal agencies can recognize 
special districts as units of local government for the purpose of being 
eligible for Federal grants and other Federal assistance.
  Congress and the Federal Government must continually work to ensure 
Federal assistance programs are authorized, funded, and implemented to 
best address the needs of local communities. This should include 
careful consideration of the intricacies of local governments and a 
rigorous commitment to ensuring Federal assistance promotes equal 
opportunity for everyone.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate subcommittee Chairman Pat Fallon and 
Representative Brittany Pettersen for their excellent bipartisan work 
and support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Fallon), my friend.
  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner), my good friend, for yielding time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7525, the Special 
District Grant Accessibility Act, introduced by myself and my 
colleague, Representative Pettersen, from the Centennial State of 
Colorado.
  Mr. Speaker, special districts are a type of local government 
authorized by State law, which deliver specialized services to specific 
communities that would otherwise not be provided. In rural areas, for 
instance, special districts may provide fire protection, mosquito 
control, ambulatory services, et cetera. Special districts also occur 
in urban areas and can provide airport, road, and transit services.
  According to the National Special Districts Coalition, as my 
colleague from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) said, there are about 35,000 
special districts in the country, and they are in every State.
  In Texas, we have over 3,300 special districts providing all manner 
of government goods and services. Yet, as these lesser-known units of 
government, special districts have struggled to consistently access 
Federal financial assistance.
  H.R. 7525 would remedy that and would emphasize that special 
districts are units of local government and are, therefore, eligible 
for Federal financial assistance by establishing a definition in law 
for special districts and requiring the Office of Management and Budget 
to issue guidance to Federal agencies, as well as grant-issuing 
agencies.

  This bill also requires an OMB report to Congress on the agency's 
implementation and conformity to the guidance.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pettersen and the bipartisan 
coalition of Members who cosponsored this bill, and I encourage a 
``yes'' vote.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. Pettersen).
  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Special 
District Grant Accessibility Act, and I thank my colleague, 
Representative Fallon, for his leadership and bipartisan collaboration 
on this bill. I also thank the advocates who raised this concern with 
our office and give a huge shout-out to my team for doing the work to 
get it to this point.
  Special districts are local governments that are created by the 
people for a community to deliver specialized services. There are 
35,000 special districts across the country, and this includes 
providing services ranging from drinking water and wastewater 
management to healthcare, transit, natural resource conservation, and 
much more.
  This bipartisan bill will ensure Federal policies better reflect the 
complexities of local government by creating a Federal definition. I 
didn't realize that there were so many barriers at the local level to 
actually drawing down those Federal funds when it comes to community 
block grants, childcare services, and even transportation needs.
  We also saw significant barriers when it came to the pandemic and the 
ARPA funding that was going down to help support communities through 
that difficult time. We know that this is a very important and small 
step forward, but it is going to make a big difference for people 
across Colorado and the Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am 
prepared to close.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 7525, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan bill to emphasize that special districts are eligible for 
Federal financial assistance.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7525.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, every year numerous laws require Federal agencies to 
produce thousands of reports, with a single report costing tens of 
thousands of taxpayer dollars.
  While many reports help inform Congress and the public, some are 
outdated or duplicative.
  With nearly 100 agencies issuing annual reports as required under 
law, there is a great opportunity for cost savings and improving 
government efficiency by addressing outdated reports.
  Agencies are already required to compile lists of the reports they 
generate, but this information is not included in an agency's annual 
budget document which Congress scrutinizes on an annual basis.
  The Eliminate the Useless Reports Act requires each agency to 
identify and reduce the frequency of duplicative or outdated reports in 
its regular budget justification documents.
  This bill would increase government efficiency and save taxpayer 
dollars by eliminating unnecessary reports.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives  Robert Garcia and Grothman for 
their leadership on this issue and Budget Committee Chairman Arrington 
for

[[Page H2852]]

his collaboration with the House Oversight Committee for advancing this 
bill today.
  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan commonsense 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I 
rise today in support of S. 2073. I thank my colleague from California, 
Ranking Member  Robert Garcia, for introducing the House companion to 
the Eliminate Useless Reports Act of 2023. I am proud to support this 
bipartisan legislation. The accumulation of outdated and redundant 
reports is something that the Oversight Committee has tried to deal 
with several times over the past few decades.
  The Eliminate Useless Reports Act takes an innovative approach. It 
would establish clear procedures for Federal agencies to request the 
elimination or modification of duplicative or outdated reports in their 
annual budget justifications. This would ensure that the correct 
committee of jurisdiction with the appropriate expertise considers this 
request. This bill would better inform Congress and the executive 
branch and ensure that agencies are not wasting time or resources on 
redundant or archaic reports.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will get this done in less than 5 
minutes. As has been pointed out, anybody around here a while knows 
that frequently when a bill passes we include requirements that an 
agency provide reports.
  Another way for a Congressman to pass a bill is just to pass a 
freestanding bill that requires another report. Obviously, these 
reports aren't cheap. There is a great deal of hours spent as the 
agencies compile the reports. It is time to have a look at these 
reports and see how many are necessary and how many we can do away 
with.
  The President's most recent budget request identified 53 reports that 
were outdated or duplicative. Some examples: Department of Commerce 
report on business licensing activities in Iraq. This report was signed 
into law in 2003 during the start of the Iraq war. As our presence 
there diminished, the need for regular reporting on Iraq-bound business 
licenses has outlived its uselessness.
  There is the Department of Labor report on a community college and 
career training grant. This is another report that is outdated. The 
authorization of the appropriations has expired, and no funds have been 
appropriated for this program since 2014; nevertheless, the requirement 
for the report lives on.
  There is the annual FTC report on the market concentration of the 
ethanol industry. The FTC has submitted the report every year since 
2005, but each and every year the ethanol market has not been overly 
concentrated, entry into the market is easy, and the present 
circumstances do not justify a presumption that a single ethanol 
producer could set prices. In other words, the usefulness of the report 
is no longer in existence.
  The Eliminate Useless Reports Act simply requires each agency to 
identify and recommend eliminating, modifying, or reducing the 
frequency of duplicative reports. Recommendations from agencies will be 
considered by the relevant committees so they can take appropriate 
legislative steps.
  This bill would increase the efficiency of identifying outdated or 
duplicative reports.
  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to co-lead the House version in a nice 
bipartisan effort with my Oversight Subcommittee colleague, Congressman 
 Robert Garcia from California.
  I am also thankful for the bipartisan Senate cosponsors to this bill, 
Senators Ossoff and Lankford.
  I urge adoption of Senate bill S. 2073, an important bipartisan step 
toward improving the efficiency of the Federal Government.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for S. 2073, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this 
bill that will increase government efficiency, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 2073, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

[[Page H2853]]

Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7524, the GSA Technology 
Accountability Act.
  The General Services Administration's Technology and Transformation 
Services, or TTS, manages several Federal technology projects and 
initiatives.
  These projects and initiatives are mostly funded through two funds--
the Citizen Services Fund and the Acquisition Services Fund.
  There is little transparency, however, into how money from these 
funds is allocated and what TTS is doing with its resources.
  This bill requires the administrator of GSA to submit an annual 
report to Congress regarding each program funded by the Citizen 
Services Fund and some programs funded by the Acquisition Services 
Fund.
  This annual report will include information about funded programs, 
projects and initiatives, and reimbursements associated with each 
program.
  This bill provides much-needed transparency into TTS programs and 
technology-related projects.
  I thank Representative Pete Sessions, chairman of the House Oversight 
Committee Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal 
Workforce, and Representative Gerry Connolly for their work on this 
legislation.
  I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense bill to 
increase transparency and provide additional oversight of taxpayer 
dollars, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the GSA Technology 
Accountability Act.
  I thank my colleagues, Representative Comer and Chairman Sessions and 
their staffs, for their partnership and collaboration on this bill. I 
am pleased to support the updated form of this bill.
  This bill would bring increased transparency to some of the General 
Services Administration's leading programs that are funded by the 
Federal Citizens Services Fund and the Federal Acquisition Fund.
  As GSA continues to make the technological advancements that allow 
the American people to securely access government services, this bill 
will allow Congress to fulfill its vital oversight responsibilities.
  Once again, I thank my colleagues for working with us to address 
GSA's concerns about the original legislation and ensure that this bill 
allows for increased transparency without creating unnecessary 
administrative burdens.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Sessions), my friend.
  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman and 
friend from Kansas for yielding.
  I also thank my colleague from the District of Columbia, representing 
the minority or the Democratic Party on the Subcommittee on Government 
Operations and the Federal Workforce, for her leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. It is a bill that 
we tried to make bipartisan and to include ideas from a number of 
people that were on the committee.
  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations and the 
Federal Workforce, we worked together not only holding hearings, but 
discussing the need for transparency and better technology for projects 
from the General Services Administration.
  As it stands now, the government's internal technology consultancy is 
mostly opaque in its operation, resulting in the lack of competition 
and a few instances of serious failures from the GSA's products. Those 
are products that were developed in-house.
  Last year, the GSA Inspector General reported that Login.gov, a GSA 
product that was intended to be a single-sign-on solution for the 
Federal Government and government agencies, was intentionally 
misleading Federal agencies about its technical capabilities and 
ability to actually authenticate the users.
  In other words, Mr. Speaker, as people came in to do business with 
the government agency, GSA had a front to it that would assuredly tell 
that agency wherever they were going and with great likelihood exactly 
who that person was.
  This subversion left government websites exposed to fraudulent users 
and removed a critical barrier for criminals to improperly claim 
government benefits. In other words, they said that it contained 
certainty about who that person was that came to them for those 
agencies then did not need to do further investigation to make sure who 
was seeking government benefits.
  While we do not currently know the total amount of fraud that was 
committed because Login.gov did not provide adequate system security as 
it was required and stated that it was prepared to do, we do know that 
the American taxpayer was on the hook for hundreds of billions of 
dollars--up to $400 billion--in fraud from various COVID relief 
programs; each of these agencies counting on the person that they were 
speaking to and in contact with were the correct person.
  The central tactic used in this was identity theft. It was fraud.
  In order to prevent such fraud in the future, Federal systems must 
have identity verification capabilities that work.

  Instead, the GSA marketed, and Federal agencies paid for, an identity 
verification system that was either not present or did not work.
  It left the door wide open for criminals pretending to be someone 
else, to steal benefits, to steal information, and otherwise compromise 
government systems with a false identity.
  Last year, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
Subcommittees, which I chair, held a hearing and it was a bipartisan 
answer that we came up with. It is a problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues, including the gentleman from 
Virginia, Mr. Connolly, for his support of this legislation, but 
certainly back in the committee as we brought this bill forward, it was 
a bipartisan answer that no matter whose fault it was, it needed to be 
fixed.
  We looked at it, I think, the same way. I am very proud of this 
committee, and I am very proud of my colleagues, the Democrats, the 
minority party, for working with us just like it was a part of their 
responsibility, which it was. I totally support that.
  With Login.gov, the Technology Transformation Service failed. Now, we 
are going to provide the transparency that is required in this bill. I 
am very proud of this work that was done on a bipartisan basis.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1715

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this 
commonsense bill to increase transparency and provide additional 
oversight of taxpayer dollars.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7524, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the

               ASTRONAUT SAFE TEMPORARY RIDE OPTIONS ACT

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 272) to amend title 31, United

[[Page H2854]]

States Code, to authorize transportation for Government astronauts 
returning from space between their residence and various locations, and 
for other purposes.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                                H.R. 272

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Astronaut Safe Temporary 
     Ride Options Act'' or the ``ASTRO Act''.

     SEC. 2. TRANSPORTATION OF ASTRONAUTS RETURNING FROM SPACE.

       (a) In General.--Section 1344(a)(2) of title 31, United 
     States Code, is amended--
       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;
       (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or'' after the 
     comma at the end; and
       (3) by inserting before the matter following subparagraph 
     (B) the following:
       ``(C) necessary for post-flight transportation of 
     Government astronauts, and others subject to reimbursable 
     arrangements, returning from space for the performance of 
     medical research, monitoring, diagnosis, or treatment, or 
     other official duties, prior to receiving post-flight medical 
     clearance to operate a motor vehicle,''.
       (b) Report.--
       (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of 
     enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the 
     Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space 
     Administration shall submit an annual report to Congress on 
     the use of the authority providing transportation under 
     subparagraph (C) of section 1344(a)(2) of title 31, United 
     States Code (as added by subsection (a) of this Act).
       (2) Contents.--Any such report shall include the name of 
     any individual who received such transportation, the number 
     of instances such transportation was provided, and the total 
     cost of such transportation for the year preceding the date 
     such report is submitted.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 272, the ASTRO Act.
  First of all, let's give respect for the name ASTRO Act. As far as 
the names of bills go, that ranks way up there as far as the ones I 
have seen, so high compliments.
  This will streamline a burdensome administrative process regarding 
government-provided transportation for astronauts returning from space 
flight. When astronauts return from space travel, NASA provides them 
with home-to-work transportation so that the agency can monitor, 
evaluate, diagnose, and provide these brave men and women with medical 
treatment until they are medically cleared to drive.
  Under existing statute, NASA's authorization of this transportation 
for the astronauts must include concurrent reports to Congress with 
details about the authorized transportation. Reporting in this manner 
can be challenging to NASA as it can make it difficult to maintain up-
to-date authorizations as crewmembers are replaced or reassigned to 
different missions.
  The ASTRO Act will amend current law to enable NASA to authorize the 
use of official transportation between residence and worksite without 
such unworkable reporting requirements. However, the bill maintains 
appropriate congressional transparency by requiring NASA to provide 
Congress with an annual report on its use of this new authorization.
  I thank the sponsor of the bill, Congressman Babin, for his work. I 
also thank the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for 
its bipartisan support of this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  The ASTRO Act would give the Administrator of NASA the authority to 
allow astronauts returning from space to receive home-to-work 
transportation from the agency. Such transportation is currently 
permitted only on a case-by-case basis, and it must be reported to 
Congress. This bill also requires NASA to report annually to Congress 
on the use of this authority.
  These seem like reasonable changes to me, and I support this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Babin).
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 272, the Astronaut 
Safe Temporary Ride Options Act, or, for short, the ASTRO Act. As the 
bill's sponsor, I thank Chairman Comer for his help in getting the bill 
to the floor.
  One of the great honors of serving as the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics is having the opportunity to meet 
our astronauts preparing to go to space and to hear from them after 
they return from their missions. The ASTRO Act is a result of these 
conversations and NASA's advocacy for increased astronaut safety.
  The brave men and women who wear the iconic blue flight suit risk 
their lives to advance America's leadership in space. We owe it to them 
to ensure that when they return from long-duration space missions, 
their recovery and health studies are not hampered by bureaucracy.
  The space environment poses significant medical issues, such as 
osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, broken bones from reentry, vision and 
ocular changes, and disrupted equilibrium, which prevent astronauts 
from being able to drive when they come back home.
  However, NASA astronauts' participation in physiological research and 
longitudinal studies upon their return from space informs future 
exploration efforts and how we treat future astronauts. It is 
imperative that they get these things checked.
  The ASTRO Act streamlines the approval process for astronauts to 
receive transportation to and from their homes and the Johnson Space 
Center for doctor visits until they are medically cleared to resume 
driving. There are no costs associated with this bill but, rather, a 
significant paperwork reduction in the approval process.
  Additionally, my bill provides transparency by requiring NASA to send 
an annual report to Congress on how this authority is used in the 
future.
  Astronauts' health data acquired by the Johnson Space Center upon 
return from space is invaluable. This bill ensures hassle-free 
transportation to and from these important medical evaluations so that 
we can appropriately study the impacts of space exploration on the 
human body.
  As we prepare to go to the Moon and farther to Mars and beyond, it is 
incumbent upon us to streamline operations to enable discovery and 
innovation. America has long been the leader in space exploration, and 
we must remain there. We will continue to push the bounds of our 
universe outward.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeff Jackson for cosponsoring this 
legislation bipartisanly as well as Chairman Comer and Chairman Lucas 
for their support. I urge my colleagues to please support this bill.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, while it may sound like a mundane problem, 
the underlying need for this bill is anything but that. We owe it to 
these courageous men and women who leave behind families and friends to 
spend months in space to cut through the red tape and take care of them 
upon their return.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 272.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

       SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT POST OFFICE BUILDING

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3354) to designate the facility of the United States Postal 
Service located at 220 North Hatcher Avenue in Purcellville, Virginia, 
as the ``Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Post Office Building''.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 3354

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT POST OFFICE 
                   BUILDING.

       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal 
     Service located at 220 North Hatcher Avenue in Purcellville, 
     Virginia, shall be known and designated as the ``Secretary of 
     State Madeleine Albright Post Office Building''.
       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the 
     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be

     Post Office Building''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on the measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name a post 
office in Purcellville, Virginia, for former Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright.
  Secretary Albright was born in Prague in 1937 and immigrated to the 
United States with her family in 1948.
  In 1993, President Clinton appointed her Ambassador to the United 
Nations, a position in which she served until her appointment as 
Secretary of State in 1996, the first woman to be appointed to that 
position and the highest ranking woman in the history of the U.S. 
Government at that time.
  For 50 years, Secretary Albright resided in Loudoun County, where 
this post office is located.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3354 to designate the 
facility of the United States Postal Service located at 220 North 
Hatcher Avenue in Purcellville, Virginia, as the Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright Post Office Building.
  This legislation, introduced by my tremendous colleague, 
Representative Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, would designate a post 
office after former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
  Secretary Albright fled Communist rule under Czechoslovakia and 
immigrated to Denver, Colorado, in 1948. She committed herself to a 
life of public service, including working for the U.S. Senate under 
then-Senator Edmund Muskie, and later served the Carter administration 
as a White House staff member and a staffer of the National Security 
Council.
  Secretary Albright was appointed by President Clinton as Ambassador 
to the United Nations in 1993 and was a critical force behind the 
expansion of NATO ``to build, for the very first time, a peaceful, 
democratic, and undivided transatlantic community.'' She was committed 
to the democratization and security of European nations that escaped 
Soviet rule.
  Secretary Albright is remembered as an important force behind the 
global fight against climate change, including by supporting the 
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to fight 
global climate change. This protocol was eventually adopted in 1997.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).
  Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, last year, I was diagnosed with progressive 
supranuclear palsy, or PSP. PSP makes it very difficult for me to 
speak, and I use an assistive app so that you and our colleagues can 
understand me.
  I am proud to be here today speaking in support of my bill to rename 
the Purcellville, Virginia, post office in honor of my former 
constituent, the late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who chose 
not to have her mail delivered to her rural western Loudoun County farm 
but instead became a fixture at the post office that will bear her 
name.
  Secretary Albright was a fearless trailblazer for women and a devoted 
public servant who touched the lives of so many whom she taught, 
mentored, and worked with, including me. Her relentless defense of 
democracy and advocacy for human rights, inspired by her own lived 
experience fleeing Nazi persecution, made her an icon here at home and 
around the globe.
  It is my honor to lead this legislation to celebrate her historic 
life and legacy here in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, where 
her farm is located and where she spent as much time as she was able.
  Secretary Albright once said the greatest honor of her life was 
representing the United States of America, a sentiment I am sure we all 
share as Members of the House of Representatives.
  Throughout her life, Secretary Albright received numerous accolades 
and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. I am 
honored that the Virginia delegation and I can bestow this posthumous 
honor on Secretary Albright and her family and help ensure that her 
legacy continues to live on in Virginia for generations to come.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this 
bill honoring an American leader. I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 3354.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

                    LUKE LETLOW POST OFFICE BUILDING

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7423) to designate the facility of the United States Postal 
Service located at 103 Benedette Street in Rayville, Louisiana, as the 
``Luke Letlow Post Office Building''.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7423

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. LUKE LETLOW POST OFFICE BUILDING.

       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal 
     Service located at 103 Benedette Street in Rayville, 
     Louisiana, shall be known and designated as the ``Luke Letlow 
     Post Office Building''.

       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the 
     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be 
     a reference to the ``Luke Letlow Post Office Building''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Kansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name a post 
office in Rayville, Louisiana, for Congressman-elect Luke Letlow.
  Letlow was a native Louisianan who attended Louisiana Tech 
University, where he was a member of the Louisiana Tech College 
Republicans and the Louisiana Federation of College Republicans.
  As a young college graduate, Letlow was a staff member for former 
Congressmen John Cooksey and Ralph Abraham as well as Governor Bobby 
Jindal.
  In 2020, Letlow launched a successful bid for Louisiana's Fifth 
Congressional District seat. He was set to be sworn in to the United 
States House of Representatives on January 3, 2021. Sadly, he passed 
away from complications due to COVID-19 on December 29, 2020.
  I support naming a post office in memory of Congressman-elect Letlow, 
and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
  I would say on a personal note that I consider it a loss to me and to 
my colleagues to not have the opportunity to serve with Mr. Letlow. We 
would have been sworn in to Congress on the exact same day.
  I am grateful, however, to get to serve alongside his wife, Julia, 
and to get to experience him through her memories of him, and their two 
beautiful children, Jeremiah and Jacqueline.
  I am honored to have the opportunity to manage the Republican time on 
this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7423, to designate the 
facility of the United States Postal Service located at 103 Benedette 
Street in Rayville, Louisiana, as the Luke Letlow Post Office Building.
  Congressman-elect Luke Letlow was poised to represent Louisiana's 
Fifth Legislative District after winning the special election seat when 
he tragically passed away from complications of COVID on December 29, 
2020.
  He is remembered by his congressional colleagues for his staunch 
commitment to public service. I encourage my colleagues to join me in 
honoring the life of Congressman-elect Letlow by naming the post office 
in Rayville, Louisiana, after him.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for this 
bill and also to express to the House the heartfelt gratitude of Luke's 
family, his friends, and all who loved him.
  My husband was someone I knew to be a truly exceptional and gifted 
individual. Luke's purpose was always driven by people, and his passion 
was public service. Luke was the kind of person who would meet a 
stranger and just a few minutes later could walk away, having 
established an enduring friendship with them.
  Mr. Speaker, I can't even begin to count the number of people who 
called, texted, emailed, or wrote me letters in the days after we lost 
Luke telling me how he had touched their lives.
  Throughout his career, I saw so many times when he would spend hours 
on the phone talking to local mayors and police jurors about the 
problems in their communities, showing them the same care and attention 
that he would give if it had been the Governor of Louisiana or the 
Speaker of the House on the other end of the line.
  As I travel the Fifth District to this day, I still meet many of 
those same people who fondly remember those times that he helped them.
  What was different about Luke and one of the incredible things that 
set him apart was the fact that his mind was like an atlas, 
encyclopedia, and historical narrative of our little corner of 
northeast Louisiana. He not only knew the people and their concerns, 
but he knew their stories.
  He could drive through those little, small towns all over our region 
and show you where Ulysses Grant and his troops had prepared for the 
attack on Vicksburg, where Theodore Roosevelt had gone hunting for the 
famous black bear, and where Huey and Earl Long played as young 
brothers and later campaigned for votes as Governors.
  There is no place that Luke loved more than his own Richland Parish, 
the home of the Letlow family for eight generations. His story was 
deeply rooted in the fertile soil of the delta, which gave name to his 
pet project, Richland Roots, a website he created to tell the stories 
of Richland Parish and its rich history.
  He would spend countless hours researching the past of the towns and 
villages of the parish, the landmarks, the churches and, yes, even the 
post offices. You see, Luke understood that all over Richland Parish 
there were these little pieces of the past that were left with us, 
containing both the stories and the lessons from those who came before 
us. Now he will receive his very own landmark, a little piece of 
Richland Parish to help tell his story.
  It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that one day another history-loving kid 
from Richland Parish will see that post office and learn about Luke's 
story.
  I hope they will learn about how his journey took him from the back 
roads and small towns of northeast Louisiana to the corridors of the 
United States Capitol in Washington.

  I hope they will learn about how he dedicated himself to the people 
of our region, working every single day to make their lives better.
  I hope they will learn about the fact that even though he was never 
able to serve as a Member of this House, the men and women who served 
here thought so highly of him that they bestowed this high honor.
  Mr. Speaker, when Luke's light would shine on you, it was impossible 
to feel anything other than his warmth and love. He had a way of making 
you feel exceptional, and I know that to be true for every person in 
his life. It is what I miss the most.
  Luke may be gone, but his light will never leave us. I see it every 
day in the faces of our children: our son, Jeremiah, and our daughter, 
Jacqueline. I see it every time I go home and drive those back roads in 
Richland Parish and see the places that he loved so much.
  By bestowing this honor on him, you are ensuring that his name and 
his legacy will live on long after all of us are gone. I ask my 
colleagues to join our majority leader and our Louisiana delegation in 
supporting this bill on behalf of Luke's family and his friends and all 
who loved him.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority leader.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kansas for yielding. 
Especially having Julia Letlow, our colleague, here, it is bittersweet 
for us in the Louisiana delegation, for all of us in Congress, those of 
us who knew Luke--I got to know him so well over so many years--and 
those who didn't know him but were getting ready to serve with him. He 
literally passed away days before getting sworn in after being elected 
as a Member of Congress.
  It is Luke's journey. It is Luke's story that we are here to 
celebrate today and ultimately which will live on at the Luke Letlow 
Post Office in Rayville, his hometown. He was born in Start, Louisiana, 
in Richland Parish, and it is there in Richland Parish that this post 
office that we are dedicating is, hopefully, going to be enjoying a

[[Page H2857]]

formal ceremony with all of us and the whole family.
  When I think of how I first met Luke, it was when he was working for 
Bobby Jindal. As Julia said so eloquently, Luke's whole life was 
dedicated to public service. When he graduated, he immediately was an 
intern for Congressman Cooksey and came up here. I think that was when 
he probably got the bug a little bit.
  He ultimately got the bug to serve other people. Luke did it so well. 
He served other people with joy in so many different roles. After he 
worked for Congressman Cooksey, he then worked for candidate Bobby 
Jindal. That is when I got to know him.
  There was no harder worker than Luke Letlow, but also no happier 
person. He was always happy, always had a smile. He always just wanted 
to do the best he could. ``Win the day'' was Luke's term, and he would 
just work incredibly hard for whoever he worked for.
  Bobby ultimately won that seat in Congress, and Luke became his 
district director. The district director is the person who covers the 
district, does so many of the unheralded things that those of us 
Members of Congress deal with and the people who call us. We just call 
our district director and say: Can you take care of this, and can you 
see if we can help that person out? That was really where Luke thrived 
the most.
  Then, ultimately, he went into the private sector but was called back 
yet again when Ralph Abraham ran for Congress, and Luke served as his 
chief of staff. Ralph had set a term limit on himself, and when the 
term limit hit, Ralph stepped down from Congress. At that point, that 
is when Luke made the decision: Here is my moment. Do I do this? 
Ultimately, he decided to run.
  I remember, he and I spoke when he chose to get into the race as a 
candidate. I knew he was going to do well. I could just tell because he 
was a natural. He was a natural with people. He actually cared about 
people. It is hard to be in this line of work without caring about 
people. He had done it in so many roles for so many other people. 
Finally, when it was time to run himself, he did it with the fervor 
that you would expect. He never slowed down. Every single day he worked 
so hard.
  I know for those of us who have gotten to know Julia so well, the 
family is what always came first to Luke. He wanted to be known really 
first as a husband and a father, and he did both of those jobs 
incredibly well; exceeded, I am sure, what anybody would have expected.
  The legacy that I think we all really remember of Luke here is that 
of a public servant. When you hear all of the things that he did in his 
life, he was somebody who just wanted to serve other people, and he did 
it so well.
  I think the hardest part for me is after he had gotten elected, we 
talked a lot because he was so eager to get ready for this new role, 
this new career, to come up to Congress and do something that he had 
thought about doing for so long, a role he had played helping so many 
other people who served in Congress, but now this was the time where he 
was going to start his new career.
  He was talking about what committees he wanted to get on. In fact, 
you know, in the days before he passed, the last conversation I had 
with him was about him talking to me about what committees he wanted to 
be on and how he wanted to best serve that district and all of the 
parishes. It was a very large, sprawling district, and yet he couldn't 
wait to serve in that capacity. That was the conversation that we had.
  You never thought someone so young and so vibrant could leave us so 
early. I tell you, for Julia, we are all so proud of her and just the 
strength that she has shown in these years since. We call Julia our 
steel magnolia because she has represented the family incredibly well. 
She has represented Luke's legacy incredibly well because while he 
never got the opportunity to serve as a Member of Congress, he served. 
He served the State of Louisiana, and he served the United States of 
America in so many different roles.

                              {time}  1745

  I consider him a colleague because we talked about what that would be 
like so much, and I just think this is one way we can pay tribute to 
Luke's legacy of service, to name this post office so that people, when 
they are carrying out their daily chores and going to check their mail 
or send an important note to somebody, they can just look up and think 
about what Luke meant and what they meant to Luke because he really did 
care about the people that ultimately he worked for and that he was 
going to represent in Congress.
  I say this on behalf of the whole delegation, and I know others are 
going to be speaking as well, the legacy of Luke Letlow will shine on 
for a long, long time.
  It is what he represented and that spirit, that strong, positive 
energy every single day to win the day, is what I will always remember 
about Luke Letlow.
  I urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill and look forward to 
that ceremony where we get to truly be in front of the whole family, 
paying tribute to a man who lived a life of public service.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor and privilege to 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), the 
Speaker of the House.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  I rise today in support of H.R. 7423, a bill to designate the United 
States Post Office in Rayville, Louisiana, after our dear friend and 
our former Louisiana Fifth District Congressman, Luke Letlow.
  In December of 2020, Luke tragically passed away just days before 
taking his oath of office and serving here with us in Congress.
  We were all devastated. He was in the prime of his life, 41 years 
old, with two beautiful children and a lovely wife, Julia, who is one 
of Kelly's and my favorite people in the world.
  He had spent his entire professional career serving the people of 
Louisiana in the Governor's office and our congressional delegation.
  There was no greater ambassador of Louisiana culture and values, and 
I have no doubt he would have been a leading Member of our delegation 
and of Congress.
  Luke was a native son of Start, Louisiana, a town of just a few 
hundred people nestled outside of Monroe in northeast Louisiana, and it 
was there that he developed what was truly a servant's heart.
  He had a peaceful, easygoing nature. Everybody loved him. Whoever 
held his attention was the most important person in the world at that 
moment.
  Luke listened first, and then he acted--a quality this town could use 
a lot more of. He was passionate about Louisiana, about our issues like 
agriculture and energy and, more than anything else, his beautiful 
family.
  I don't remember having many conversations with Luke that did not 
involve his family because he was so proud of them.
  I know he is smiling down upon his wife, Julia, our extraordinary 
colleague who has been such a tremendous asset to this institution and 
a great champion for our State.
  Their two beautiful children, Jeremiah and Jacqueline, who have 
become fixtures around here, are blessed to have incredible role models 
as parents.
  I am grateful to our entire Louisiana delegation for joining together 
in this effort, and I am grateful for the idea that we have had here. I 
am grateful for the comfort of knowing where he is.
  By passing this legislation, the Rayville community will continue to 
honor the life and legacy of a great American and a great Louisianian. 
I look forward to its swift passage.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding time. I had prepared remarks, but let me just speak from my 
heart.
  It is a beautiful gesture that this body can name a post office after 
our friend and colleague, Luke Letlow, in honor of his service and his 
dedication to his State and his community and his country, to children 
of God across the world.
  Luke was a very special man. It is a gesture to the American families 
from sea to shining sea, which has suffered loss, including my own.
  Today, we stand in support of the love of family, and we extend the 
heart

[[Page H2858]]

of our Nation by naming one of our oldest institutions, a microcosm of 
what America is, the Postal Service.
  To name a post office after Luke is to honor not just his family and 
his wife, our colleague, Julia, but it is to honor all American 
families.
  I thank my brothers and sisters of this august body for allowing this 
moment where we cherish what it is to be an American, to serve our 
country and our fellow man, to be part of a family, and to remember 
those that we have lost.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for 
his comments. I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge the 
passage of H.R. 7423, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LaTURNER. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this 
bill, which rightly honors the life and legacy of a great man, 
Congressman-elect Luke Letlow.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7423.
  The question was taken.

               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

                                              Office of the Clerk,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC
       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to transmit herewith a 
     copy of a letter received from Ms. Kristen Zebrowski Stavisky 
     and Mr. Raymond J. Riley, III, Co-Executive Directors, New 
     York State Board of Elections, indicating that, according to 
     the unofficial results for the Special Election held on April 
     30, 2024, the Honorable Timothy M. Kennedy was elected for 
     Representative to Congress for the Twenty-Sixth Congressional 
     District of New York.
       With best wishes, I am
           Sincerely,
                                                Kevin F. McCumber,
                                                     Acting Clerk.
       Enclosure.

                                            Board of Elections

                                          Albany, NY, May 1, 2024.
     Hon. Kevin F. McCumber,
     Acting Clerk, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC
       Dear Mr. McCumber: This is to advise you that the 
     unofficial results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, 
     April 30, 2024, for Representative in Congress from the 
     Twenty-Sixth Congressional District of New York, show that 
     Timothy M. Kennedy received 46,527 or 68.04% of the total 
     number of votes cast for that office.
       It would appear from these unofficial results that Timothy 
     M. Kennedy was elected as Representative in Congress from the 
     Twenty-Sixth Congressional District of New York.
       To the best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there 
     is no contest to this election.
       As soon as the official results are certified to this 
     office by the Erie County Board of Elections and the Niagara 
     County Board of Elections, representing all jurisdictions 
     involved, an official Certificate of Election will be 
     prepared for transmittal as required by law.
           Sincerely,
     Kristen Zebrowski Stavisky,
       Co-Executive Director.
     Raymond J. Riley, III,
       Co-Executive Director.

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, as dean of the New York delegation, it is my 
distinct honor to rise today to introduce Congressman-elect Tim 
Kennedy.
  I can think of no better person to represent New York's 26th 
Congressional District and succeed our friend Brian Higgins than Tim 
Kennedy. As a lifelong resident of Buffalo who grew up in a blue-collar 
family, Tim embodies the values of hard work, family, and fighting for 
the little guy that makes western New York so great.
  As a New York State senator for over 13 years, Tim has been a 
formidable advocate for our region. As chair of the New York Senate 
Transportation Committee, he secured a historic $100 million for the 
Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, helped deliver record 
investment for our roads and transportation networks, and spearheaded 
legislation enhancing transportation safety and accountability.
  Beyond transportation, Tim has been a long-time champion for western 
New York's workforce and economic development, which is evidenced 
through his support for the Northland Workforce Center and the 
revitalization of Buffalo's iconic Central Terminal.
  As he steps into his new role, I speak on behalf of the entire New 
York congressional delegation, and we are confident that Tim Kennedy 
will continue to fight tirelessly for the prosperity and safety of our 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Kennedy), 
our newest Member.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Nadler, my colleagues 
in the New York delegation, Mr. Speaker, and Leader Jeffries.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you humbled by the opportunity God has 
given us to be together in this moment, this awesome and magnificent 
responsibility that has been granted to me by the people of western New 
York.
  I am grateful to those who have entrusted me with their vote and 
their confidence to represent our beloved Buffalo-Niagara region in the 
United States Congress.
  I want to take a moment to recognize my family, who is here with me, 
my wife, Katie, and our children, Connor, Eireann, and Padraic. I also 
want to recognize my parents, Martin and Mary Kennedy, and my in-laws, 
Dave and Jane Duerk. My brother, John, also made the visit down, along 
with many other family members and friends. I am grateful that they can 
all join us here today.
  Looking down on us are our baby angel, Brigid, along with so many 
other family members and friends who have passed on and whose spirits 
remain with us here today on this auspicious occasion. They are no 
doubt toasting and celebrating in Heaven above.
  Calling Buffalo, New York, and America home were the O'Briens and 
O'Donohues, Wilsons and Flynns, Dobmeirs and Stearns, McCarthys and 
Duffys. Mixed all together, the result is a Kennedy.
  I hail from the City of Good Neighbors, the community of good 
neighbors; the original home of the Seneca Nation of Indians; the 
village of Buffalo, burned to the ground by the British in the War of 
1812, and rebuilt and incorporated in 1832; the western terminus of the 
Erie Canal, helping to transform our Nation through improved commerce; 
a border community with our greatest ally, Canada, to the north; a 
region surrounded by Great Lakes; and, in between, one of the greatest 
wonders of the world, Niagara Falls. The grandeur of the falls is only 
surpassed by the people who have defined the region around us.
  Today, we stand as a community of patriotic citizens who have always 
championed democracy and freedom, from the days of serving as a final 
stop on the Underground Railroad to the Niagara Movement, the precursor 
of the NAACP, which was formed in our community. The equality and 
justice these leaders strove for over a century ago has yet to be fully 
achieved, and there is still so much more work to be done.
  In Buffalo-Niagara, we walk in the footsteps of Frederick Douglass, 
Harriet Tubman, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mary Talbert, Shirley 
Chisholm, and so many other civil rights leaders. In their spirit, we 
march on.
  It was Niagara Falls that made Buffalo the City of Light. While we 
have seen our share of darkness, Buffalo is seeing a resurgence that 
generations

only dreamt of, as a melting pot of ethnicities and cultures are 
helping to redefine our region and an economic renaissance has taken 
hold. We are a working-class community with a belief in achieving a 
better life and the American Dream through education; honest, hard 
work; and perseverance.
  I believe the character traits that define us in the Buffalo-Niagara 
region are the same ideals held by all Americans. I believe the hope we 
hold as a western New York community in achieving our greatest 
potential is shared equally by all communities across our country.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to change our country 
for the better. I am hopeful that we in this Chamber can demonstrate 
leadership on a world stage that our fellow Americans can be proud of.
  I wish to thank, once again, the people of western New York for 
having faith in me to lead our community and our country in the United 
States Congress.
  God bless us all. God bless America.

                     ONE MISSING PERSON IS TOO MANY

  (Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, this May is National Missing Persons 
Month. Over 600,000 people go missing in the United States every year. 
Tens of thousands of these folks remain missing every year.
  Law enforcement officers work hard to solve these cases as quickly as 
possible. I thank them for all they do to find these people and try to 
ensure their safety.
  Congress should do everything it can, though, to help the men and 
women in law enforcement do their jobs and bring these people home.
  That is why I joined Congressman   Joe Neguse in leading a bipartisan 
bill to improve reporting requirements for individuals who go missing 
on public lands.
  This bill, called the TRACE Act, enhances reporting requirements of 
the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System so investigators 
across multiple agencies have access to all the important information 
to catch criminals behind people's disappearances.
  No missing persons case should go unsolved just because investigators 
couldn't easily access the information they need. Improving the way our 
agencies record and share case details could save lives.
  Mr. Speaker, 600,000 missing persons is too many. One missing person 
is too many. We should do all we can to find them and help them get 
home safely.

           MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF SERGEANT BILL HOOSER

  (Mr. OWENS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today with a heavy heart as 
I mourn the loss of a true American hero, Sergeant Bill Hooser.
  In the line of duty, Sergeant Hooser demonstrated unparalleled 
courage and commitment to serving our community. His dedication to 
protecting and serving the people of Santaquin, Utah, was unwavering. 
Yet, his life was cut short in a senseless act of violence, a tragedy 
that took him from us far too soon.
  Sergeant Hooser's sacrifice serves as a stark reminder of the dangers 
our law enforcement officers face each and every day. They put their 
lives on the line to keep us safe, to uphold justice, and to maintain 
law and order. Sergeant Hooser exemplified the very best of that high 
and noble calling.
  Let's remember his bravery, integrity, and selflessness. We owe it to 
Sergeant Hooser, his family, and all those who wear the uniform to 
ensure that their sacrifices are never forgotten. We must stand 
together as Utahns and as Americans in support of our law enforcement 
officers.
  May God bless Sergeant Hooser. May He comfort his family in their 
time of grief, and may He watch over all those who continue to serve on 
the front lines of law enforcement.
  I ask that the House observe a moment of silence.

                          ____________________

     CONGRATULATING THE MONTEREY HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the Monterey High School Boys' 
Basketball Team for winning the 2024 Division 4 California State 
championship.
  The Toreadors are the second basketball team ever from Monterey 
County

[[Page H2862]]

to win a State title, and, Mr. Speaker, this one was special.
  Throughout their season, the Toreadors were determined to be 
victorious. However, after winning their league title, they actually 
lost in the sectional playoffs.
  Nevertheless, due to their overall performance during the year, the 
Toreadors were given an at-large invitation to the State playoffs and 
the 14th seed.
  Although they weren't happy with that ranking, they were thrilled 
with the opportunity to show that they were better than that and played 
with a huge chip on their shoulders.
  They beat the third seed. They beat the sixth seed. They beat the 
second seed. They beat the fourth seed, and, yes, eventually, the 
Monterey High Toreadors beat the number one seed to capture the State 
championship.
  It is historic wins like that, it is teams like this, and it is the 
attitude that they had that defines determination.
  Congratulations to Coach Daniels and the determined Toreadors for 
their historic victory and for making California's 19th Congressional 
District very proud.

                          ____________________

                    CELEBRATING NATIONAL NURSES WEEK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the men 
and women in the nursing profession. This week is National Nurses Week, 
and every year from May 6 through May 12, we celebrate the work and 
contributions nurses make in the healthcare field. National Nurses Week 
ends on Florence Nightingale's birthday, the founder of modern-day 
nursing.
  Prior to serving in Congress, I spent nearly three decades in the 
healthcare profession, and there I worked closely with nurses and saw 
firsthand the care and the compassion that they showed their patients.
  Nursing is a science and an art, reserved for those who are the most 
caring, giving, and passionate about helping others. Nurses provide 
their patients and families with comfort, compassion, guidance, and 
care.
  Mr. Speaker, we should always thank our nurses for their hard work 
and dedication, and please join me in recognizing the nursing community 
this week. We should all be grateful for their commitment to caring for 
others, especially during these trying times.

                          ____________________

                      HONORING BARRON LAMONT JONES

  (Ms. STANSBURY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Barron 
Lamont Jones of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a cherished son, brother, 
friend, and determined advocate.
  For those who knew Barron, they know his story and the unimaginable 
adversity and indomitable spirit and sense of humor that lit up a room 
and the life that he built committed to advocacy and lifting up the 
voices of those who were formerly incarcerated in our community.
  Barron's work advancing the fight for justice and equality in the 
criminal justice system while working at the ACLU was instrumental in 
the passage of the New Mexico Civil Rights Act and the New Mexico 
Voting Rights Act, among many other legislative victories.
  I join Barron's family, and especially Heather, his partner of 32 
years, his many friends, ACLU New Mexico, and so many others who are 
grieving and celebrating his life.

                           POLITICAL PRISONER

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to alert this House of the actions of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which seem to be vindicating the claim 
made by Peter Navarro that he is being held as a political prisoner.
  I have been trying for 5 weeks to be able to interview Mr. Navarro. 
There are provisions that ought to allow this, and I was informed 
directly by Director Peters, who runs the bureau, that that request 
would be denied.
  The reason it is being denied is because Peter Navarro is too 
notorious to be interviewed by a Member of Congress.
  John Gotti was interviewed when he was in prison. The QAnon Shaman 
was interviewed in prison. Director Peters herself brought NBC News 
through prisons to showcase the work of corrections that is being done.
  I think there is something else afoot here. Mr. Navarro, I am being 
told, is not being allowed to access his attorney, and it is because it 
is shameful what has been done to Peter Navarro based on a sham January 
6 committee and a sham indictment and a sham conviction that we ought 
to work to remediate immediately upon President Trump's rightful and 
righteous return to office.

                    CELEBRATING NATIONAL NURSES DAY

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on National Nurses Day, let 
us honor the unsung healthcare heroes. They hold hands, wipe tears, and 
offer comfort to our families during the most difficult times.
  Nurses are the heart and soul of our healthcare system, dedicating 
themselves tirelessly to the well-being of others.
  They work long hours, sacrificing time from their own families to 
ensure that ours are taken care of. Their commitment goes beyond the 
confines of the hospital walls.
  Today, let us take a moment to express our deepest gratitude to these 
remarkable healthcare professionals. Nurses, you are the backbone of 
our communities, and on this National Nurses Day, we honor and 
celebrate you.
  To the nurses of eastern North Carolina, thank you for your 
selflessness, courage, and unwavering commitment.

                    HONORING DONALD M. LEEBERN, JR.

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Donald Leebern, Jr.
  Don, a native of Columbus, Georgia, graduated from Columbus High 
School and went on to attend the University of Georgia. Don played 
football for the Bulldogs, winning an SEC championship in 1959 and the 
Orange Bowl in 1960.
  After his impressive career at Georgia, Don joined the family 
business, Georgia Crown Distributing Company. Don worked his way up to 
become the president of Georgia Crown where the company saw continued 
success under his leadership. In 1992, he became chairman of the board 
of the company.
  Don also served five consecutive terms on the University System Board 
of Regents after he was appointed by former Georgia Governor Zell 
Miller. This included time as regents chairman from 1994 to 1995.
  Outside of his professional career, Don was known as a generous and 
kind man. He was a founding member of the University System of Georgia 
Foundation, as well as a member of numerous professional, civic, and 
social organizations.
  Don was larger than life. He positively impacted everyone he met, and 
he will be sorely missed by all.

                    CONGRATULATING QUINYON MITCHELL

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and recognize Quinyon 
Mitchell, a cornerback from the University of Toledo. Quinyon was 
recently selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 22nd overall pick 
in the 2024 NFL draft.
  Northwest Ohio is undeniably proud of Mr. Mitchell. He became the 
first

[[Page H2863]]

Toledo Rocket selected in the first round in 31 years.
  Mr. Mitchell was the first defensive back taken in this year's draft, 
and he also became the first UT player ever named as a semifinalist for 
the Chuck Bednarik Award given annually to the Nation's top defensive 
player.
  His selection in the draft now marks three straight years that a 
Toledo player has been selected by an NFL franchise. I extend my 
heartfelt congratulations to Quinyon Mitchell for his remarkable 
achievements.
  He truly embodies the spirit of excellence that the University of 
Toledo and northwest Ohio strive to achieve.
  We all know Quinyon will continue to make us proud as he shines on 
the national stage. Go Rockets, go Quinyon, go Birds.

  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Teachers 
Appreciation Week and recognize all the outstanding educators across 
Indiana's First Congressional District.
  As we reflect on the impact that teachers have made in our lives and 
are continuing to make every day for all our students, I remain 
immensely grateful for all who have chosen to be teachers and involved 
in the school system.
  Because of their selfless passion, their boundless energy, and 
commitment to inspiration, they are essential to ensuring our future

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize economic 
development organizations across Michigan and our Nation by celebrating 
Economic Development Week.
  Every May, we acknowledge the dedication of economic developers to 
job creation, financial health, and making our communities an even 
better place to call home.
  The work done by these economic developers creates new opportunities 
and lasting impacts on townships, cities, and counties across southwest 
Michigan.
  Organizations like Lakeshore Advantage, Cornerstone Alliance, 
Southwest Michigan First, Market Van Buren, and Battle Creek Unlimited 
are the standard for economic development in Michigan, thanks to their 
strong leadership.
  As a small business owner myself, I understand the importance of 
creating a forward-looking plan that advances your community's goals 
and well-being.

                        HONORING SAMMY McDOWELL

  (Ms. OMAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life 
of Sammy McDowell, a community leader, restaurateur, and friend to all.
  Sammy grew up in Minneapolis and was a fixture in the community 
throughout his life. He worked in food service for many years before 
starting his own catering company and restaurant.
  In 2012, he opened Sammy's Avenue Eatery on West Broadway Avenue in 
north Minneapolis and recently began operating a pop-up restaurant in 
St. Paul in a space which features Black-owned businesses.
  Sammy's Avenue Eatery has become known for its delicious food that it 
serves. Over the past decade it has become an important gathering place 
for the community.
  Sammy will be remembered for his generosity toward others. He always 
went the extra mile to check in on the wellness of his friends, as well 
as his customers.
  His passion for community and the well-being of others was 
contagious. I know that the spaces he created will continue to be a 
source of friendship, inspiration, and comfort.
  Sammy had an immeasurable impact on our community, and he will be 
dearly missed by those who knew and loved him.

                             VOTING ISSUES

  (Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of question as to why 
President Biden--or a lot of people in my district wonder why President 
Biden continues to allow over a quarter million people in this country 
month after month after month.
  One of the speculations is that by letting people in here, eventually 
Congress will make them citizens, or their children or grandchildren 
become citizens, and they will change the nature of America.
  America is, of course, supposed to be a country built from moral and 
religious people and a freedom-loving people, people who do not want a 
big government, people who want to vote for limited government.
  It was of great concern that this morning I read an article about 
what is going on in North Carolina where they found people who are 
here, not citizens, voting already.
  This is not surprising, I suppose. In the first place, they give a 
lot of these people driver's licenses, and they give them other forms 
of identification.
  It is not surprising that some would slip through the cracks and vote 
before they had a chance to be educated on the limited government that 
is supposed to be the hallmark of the United States of America.
  I call on this body to crack down on people who are voting in our 
elections who are not yet legal citizens.

                              {time}  1945
     HONORING LIEUTENANT MICHAEL HOOSOCK AND OFFICER MICHAEL JENSEN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Williams) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special 
Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, these are troubling times. The 
very fabric of our society is being pulled apart. Violent protests are 
spreading across college campuses in our own Nation. Crime marches 
unchecked in our cities. The numbers of fentanyl overdoses rise 
unabated.
  Now this: the tragic deaths of two of central New York's finest, 
their lives taken in the line of duty as they stood in the gap between 
civil society and chaos.
  That night, what was another routine traffic stop turned into an 
unspeakable tragedy. Today, two more families endure indescribable 
pain.
  Only a few weeks ago, I was right here with my colleagues, in this 
very place, to speak in honor of another New York police officer who 
was killed in the line of duty. Now, we are here again after two more 
heroes have been laid to rest in my own district.
  The names of the officers who were killed are Lieutenant Michael 
Hoosock and Officer Michael Jensen.
  Lieutenant Hoosock, known to his friends as Hootch, was a husband and 
the father of three young children. He

[[Page H2864]]

was a great dad--fun, spontaneous, present, and supportive.
  In 2020, Lieutenant Hoosock was recognized with the Medal of Valor 
for his actions confronting an active shooter in Syracuse. He was a 
decades-long firefighter and the bomb squad commander in Onondaga 
County.
  Officer Jensen was a son and brother with a career of service still 
ahead of him. Friends and family remember his dedication and optimism. 
His mother, Michelle, called him her handsome son. Syracuse Police 
Chief Joseph Cecile observed that ``you could tell he took his 
responsibility seriously,'' that is, of course, in between hockey 
matches.
  Officer Jensen joined the Syracuse Police Department in early 2022. 
He served honorably in the Patrol Division on the Third Platoon day in 
and day out. Last December, he was recognized as Officer of the Month.
  Just 2 weeks ago, thousands upon thousands attended their funerals to 
weep together, to support one another, and to honor their service and 
sacrifice.
  All decent Americans mourn with the families of these fallen 
officers.
  A functioning civil society gives its law enforcement officers the 
support and tools they need to carry out their work, protecting 
innocent people and restraining those who do harm to others. I am proud 
to say that I am pro-police and anti-criminal. When our society loses 
sight of these basic truths, our worst days follow.
  To any law enforcement officers watching today, let me say this to 
you: Don't lose hope. Keep the faith. You hold the fabric of our 
society together against criminality and chaos. You alone stand between 
innocent people and those who would seek to victimize them. We need 
you. Your vigilance and your tireless service is deeply appreciated. We 
weep with you today, and we stand with you every day.
  This Congress, we have passed numerous bills to support law 
enforcement. Many, however, inexplicably languish in the Senate, where 
support for law enforcement has waned.
  We will not stop until our elected officials are doing everything in 
their capacity to empower our law enforcement professionals and to 
support their critical work to protect all Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my sacred and solemn privilege to welcome and 
acknowledge Michael Hoosock's widow, Caitlin. Cait and their three 
beautiful children are with us in the gallery this evening.
  Would you mind standing for just a moment? Thank you for being here 
with us. Thank you for blessing us.
  To Mrs. Hoosock: Today, this Nation honors your brave husband.
  To his children: This Nation is grateful for his noble service.
  Humbly, I will tell you that we mourn with you and that we recognize 
your suffering and sacrifice. May God bless and keep you and watch over 
each one of you. You will not be forgotten.
  Since these tragic events just a few short weeks ago, countless 
Members of Congress have sought me out to express their shock, anger, 
and sorrow at the loss of our heroes. I have invited them to join me on 
this solemn occasion and will yield such time as necessary that they 
may stand with me.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito).
  Mr. D'ESPOSITO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Williams and my colleagues 
who join us here tonight to salute two fallen heroes.
  Just weeks ago, we stood on the floor of this great House and saluted 
another member of law enforcement whose life was taken far too soon by 
a career-long criminal.
  When Jonathan Diller's wife and widow spoke at his funeral, she 
pleaded with those in attendance and said that just a couple of years 
prior, she listened to the funeral of two other NYPD officers who had 
lost their lives to career criminals. She pleaded that it wouldn't 
happen again and asked the elected officials who were in that church to 
make changes so that criminals did not have the upper hand and so that 
law enforcement could actually use the tools in their gun belts to 
effect change and to keep communities safe.
  I was joined by colleagues from all throughout the country again just 
weeks ago to salute Detective Jonathan Diller. Sadly, here we are 
again, paying tribute to Syracuse Police Officer Michael Jensen and 
Onondaga County Sheriff's Lieutenant Michael Hoosock, who paid and made 
that ultimate sacrifice, who legitimately were standing the line 
between good and evil and paid the price with their lives on April 14.

  Just a couple of weeks later, in North Carolina, four more law 
enforcement officers paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty: 
Joshua Eyer of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Thomas 
Weeks of the United States Marshals Service, Alden Elliott of the North 
Carolina Department of Adult Correction, and Sam Poloche of the North 
Carolina Department of Adult Correction.
  What is happening is that police officers are dying in record 
numbers. More than 23,000 members of law enforcement have died in the 
line of duty since 1786, and 136 members of law enforcement died in 
2023. In my home State of New York and in the department that I was 
proud to serve for 16 years as a detective, 5,363 of my brothers and 
sisters were injured on the job in 2023.
  Our PBA president has called the assaults ``a full-blown epidemic.'' 
The total of 5,363 attacks in 2023 was 13 percent higher than the 
previous year.
  People keep asking why and what the issue is. The issue is that in 
New York, we have a State legislature led by Democrats who have chosen 
to put criminals before law-abiding citizens, passing insane laws like 
cashless bail and criminal justice reform without ever once having a 
conversation with the men and women who actually fight crime each and 
every day, who go out on that street, who put those uniforms on, who 
pin their shields to their chests and go out and wrestle career 
criminals, take guns off the street, close out murders, and dismantle 
gangs. There never once was a conversation with any of them.
  What it has led to is a more dangerous New York. What it has led to 
is a New York where criminals feel emboldened.
  In fact, Mr. Speaker, when you go into stores now in New York and 
across this country, there are everyday things that we want to buy that 
are locked up. Why? Criminals are emboldened because Democrats across 
this country, and specifically in New York, have failed the American 
people. They have made our State less safe.
  To the family sitting in the gallery: Realize that you have elected 
officials not only in this body but across this country who will fight 
each and every day for our brothers and sisters in blue.
  To Nicole, Samuel, and Gabriel: You may not have your father to walk 
you to that first hockey game, to that first day of school, to 
something important in your life, but realize that you have law 
enforcement officers from across this country who will walk by your 
side each and every day because that is exactly what we promised when 
we took our oath. We promised that we would never forget our fallen.
  Mr. Speaker, next week, thousands upon thousands of law enforcement 
officers from around this country will come here to the Nation's 
Capital to pay tribute and homage to the men and women who have paid 
and made the ultimate sacrifice.
  Just weeks ago, they started etching the names of hundreds of members 
of law enforcement who gave their lives in 2023. Etched in one of the 
statues at our National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is a quote. 
It says: ``It is not how these officers died that made them heroes; it 
is how they lived.''
  To the family of our heroes who are here tonight, realize it is not 
how they died that made them heroes. It is about how they lived. It is 
about the change they made. It is about the arrests of the criminals 
that they put behind bars. It is about how they went out there each and 
every day to make their community that much safer. Realize that we will 
carry on their legacy forever because that is our job.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who are here this evening who 
haven't worn the uniform and who are speaking out on behalf of all of 
those who do. Law enforcement throughout this country needs to hear 
that they have people supporting them, who will pass legislation to 
keep them safe and to give them the resources they need to defend 
themselves and keep their communities safe.
  I thank Mr. Williams for gathering us here this evening to make sure 
that we pay tribute to the fallen. I promise we will never forget.

                              {time}  2000

  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with Mr. 
D'Esposito. He has worn the badge and the uniform and knows of what he 
speaks.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor all of America's 
fallen law enforcement heroes.
  A few weeks ago, as was stated, upstate New York suffered a terrible 
loss when two law enforcement officers were fatally shot while pursuing 
a driver who fled a traffic stop.
  In my home State of Minnesota, we are still mourning the deaths of 
two Burnsville police officers and a firefighter-paramedic who were 
killed responding to a domestic crisis. These men were not only law 
enforcement officers, they were husbands, fathers, friends, and beloved 
members of our communities.
  These tragedies are real reminders of the dangers our law enforcement 
officers face every day. We can never take their sacrifice or service 
for granted.
  As a former police officer with over 20 years of experience on the 
job, I have seen and experienced firsthand the violence committed 
against law enforcement. However, in the years since leaving law 
enforcement, I have noticed a dramatic rise in violent attacks against 
America's law enforcement. I am deeply concerned by this troubling 
trend of violence against those who protect and serve our communities.
  A recent story published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported 
that assaults against police in Minnesota are up 160 percent from 10 
years ago. While some are asking why this is the case, to me the 
answers are obvious.
  The reckless defund the police movement and other antipolice rhetoric 
pushed by those on the far left has emboldened criminals, worsening the 
danger law enforcement faces when they put on that uniform.
  This is unacceptable.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that one of the best ways to honor the law 
enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice is by defending 
the heroes who are still doing this dangerous and much-needed job.
  As extreme politicians in Governor's mansions, district attorneys' 
offices, State legislatures, and even here in Congress, enact policies 
that make law enforcement less safe, it is up to the rest of us to 
utterly reject these ugly attacks on the American law enforcement 
officer.
  As we honor those law enforcement officers who have given their lives 
in service to others, let us also recommit to standing in defense of 
their brothers and sisters in uniform now and forever.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stauber for his 
experience.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Williams from New 
York for yielding.
  We are so grateful to the gentleman for doing this. I thank him for 
organizing this Special Order in tribute to Syracuse police officers 
Michael Jensen and Onondaga County Sheriff Lieutenant Michael Hoosock.
  As colleagues before have mentioned, I, too, just want to thank my 
colleagues who are here who also answered the call to serve in this 
very dangerous job and who deserve our respect and our renewed support 
of them.
  As we gather here today, just a few weeks since April 14, the fateful 
day that these valiant men paid the ultimate sacrifice, our community 
continues to mourn their lives and honor their unwavering dedication, 
selfless service, and their legacies.
  Lieutenant Michael Hoosock of Clay, New York, exemplified courage and 
commitment throughout his two decades of service in the Onondaga County 
Sheriff's Office. As a testament to his unwavering bravery, his actions 
earned him the esteemed Medal of Valor in 2020.
  As we remember him today, let us not only reflect on his achievements 
as a police officer, but also on the legacy of love and devotion to his 
family he leaves behind, survived by his beloved wife and three 
children.
  Since Officer Michael Jensen joined the Syracuse Police Department 
just a few years ago on February 26, 2022, he had made an unforgettable 
impact on the force and our entire community. His dedication to duty 
and exemplary service earned him the distinguished title of Officer of 
the Month just recently in December of 2023.
  While his time among us was tragically cut short, his memory will be 
forever in the hearts of his family, friends, fellow officers, and 
everyone in his hometown of Rome, New York, my former district now 
represented by Mr. Williams, but a very important part of upstate New 
York.
  As we honor their memory, let us also reaffirm our own unwavering 
support for the brave men and women who continue to safeguard our 
communities each and every day, especially those of the Syracuse Police 
Department and the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office who continue to 
defend our community in the wake of such a tragedy.
  May the memory of these courageous men inspire us all to strive for a 
future where our men and women in uniform are not taken for granted, 
where their sacrifices are honored, and where their dedication to 
protecting and serving our communities is met with the unwavering 
respect and the support they deserve.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to be joined 
by my New York colleagues. I welcome one more.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro).
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman 
Williams, for reminding us of the unyielding sacrifice and tragic loss 
that far too many in law enforcement and their families face far too 
often in this country.
  Now to the families of Michael Hoosock and Michael Jensen, again, to 
honor the memory of their loved one, two heroic men in upstate New York 
who gave their lives in service to our community, is not only 
commendable, it is sadly becoming all too necessary.
  Yet again, we rise on another night to recognize and to memorialize 
lives of two American heroes, in this case two officers in upstate New 
York who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their community.
  Yet again, another city and county mourn the loss of two of their 
finest.
  Yet again, another two police officer families suffer unspeakable 
loss.
  These two men, Michael Hoosock and Michael Jensen, committed a 
lifetime of service to Onondaga County and the city of Syracuse in New 
York. They were routinely carrying out their obligations to a community 
when--yet again, the same headlines we have seen consistently over and 
over again throughout New York and throughout this country--they fell 
victim to an assailant who began shooting at and killing them both.
  The loss of these brave young officers is a tragedy that those 
families, and sadly too many families across New York and across 
America, see. They will never forget their loved one who was patrolling 
the streets and keeping us safe when their lives ended too soon. It is 
still a tragedy that should never have occurred.
  I have spent the last 30 years in service in upstate New York. When 
the State legislature, led by a single party and the Governor, embraced 
criminal justice reforms, they ignored the very fact that they were 
making our communities less safe. They ignored the fact that countless 
members of law enforcement, district attorneys, and those of us who 
have engaged in the criminal justice system for so long have said: that 
cashless bail would result in a more dangerous community, cashless bail 
would result in more victims being created, and cashless bail would end 
the lives of law enforcement because it would tie the hands of police 
officers. They ignored us.
  Yet Democrats in Albany and the single-party rule in New York 
continues to pass reckless policies just like cashless bail, the HALT 
Act, the Clean Slate Act, and countless other policies that are making 
it more and more difficult for law enforcement to do their job.
  Because of it, we have seen not only a rise in crime in our 
communities, but we have seen an increase in violence committed against 
police officers and the death of law enforcement officials all too 
often.
  How much more would it take?
  How many more children won't have their fathers to come home to and 
their moms to love?
  How many more families have to have an empty chair at the dining room 
table?

[[Page H2866]]

  How many more police organizations across New York must stand 
shoulder to shoulder in a somber line mourning the loss of one of their 
colleagues before the State of New York gets serious?
  Of course we want a system that respects the right of a presumption 
of innocence, but we need a system of laws that provides the resources, 
support, and tools necessary for law enforcement to protect us and so 
that they may protect themselves as their jobs only get more and more 
dangerous.
  I proudly represent communities in upstate New York just like my 
colleague, Mr. Williams, and my colleague, Ms. Tenney, who want to 
remind the leaders in Albany, New York, and in Washington that the 
violence that we have seen and the loss of lives that we have 
experienced isn't only occurring in big cities. Nevertheless, it is, 
sadly, occurring in communities big and small like those we represent.
  We have an obligation to the men and women who sacrifice for us to 
keep them safe, and now we have the families of Michael Hoosock and 
Michael Jensen to whom we owe reforms that make the jobs of the men and 
women they left behind even safer.
  So I, again, commend my colleague, Mr. Williams, for reminding us of 
the loss of these two men, the sacrifice they made, and that we are 
indebted to their families who now live on with great loss.
  I hope that their loss is not in vain and that the message that we 
get not only from tonight but from these tragedies that occur over and 
over again is that those who are entrusted in States like New York to 
make laws and keep us safe finally get serious about it.
  Mr. Speaker, to those men and women who serve in law enforcement 
across America and across New York, may you truly, genuinely come home 
to a community that supports you and the families who love you.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Molinaro for his 
comments.
  I am, again, honored to be joined by another veteran of law 
enforcement.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for 
yielding. I really appreciate him hosting this Special Order hour so 
that we can recognize the sacrifice of these two men.
  As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve 
mankind, to safeguard lives and property, to protect the innocent 
against deception, the weak against oppression and intimidation, the 
peaceful against violence and disorder, and to respect the 
constitutional rights of all men to liberty, equality, and justice.
  Mr. Speaker, that is the code of ethics for every law enforcement 
officer across this great country. That is the code and the oath that 
binds us all together as law enforcement officers.
  So as a former sheriff, I rise today with a truly heavy heart to 
honor the life of Lieutenant Michael Hoosock and of Michael Jensen.
  Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, on Sunday, April 14, of 2024, 
Lieutenant Hoosock and Officer Jensen were killed in the line of duty 
while responding to a traffic stop that went awry. These officers' 
lives were suddenly and viciously taken while answering the call to 
protect and serve their community.
  Lieutenant Hoosock was a brave servant leader and a devoted public 
servant, father, and husband. He served 17 years in the Onondaga County 
Sheriff's Office where he served wherever he was needed the most, I am 
told. Wherever they would send him, he gave his best.
  He joined the sheriff's office in 2007, was promoted to lieutenant 
and was the commander of his unit's bomb squad.
  According to those closest to him, Mr. Speaker, if you knew 
Lieutenant Hoosock, you felt like you were immediately his best friend.

                              {time}  2015

  He is survived by his wife, Caitlin, and their three children, and I 
cannot tell you how heartbroken we are for you.
  Officer Michael Jensen was a lifelong athlete, who was also an 
accountant before joining the Syracuse Police Department. He graduated 
college with two business degrees and answered the call to serve his 
community less than 3 years ago.
  However, just this past December, Officer Jensen was named Officer of 
the Month. That is the kind of officer he was. He is remembered for his 
infectious smile and his personal interactions with the residents 
throughout the Syracuse community.
  My thoughts and prayers are with both officers' families and friends, 
the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office, the Syracuse Police Department, 
and the greater Syracuse community as they mourn this great loss.
  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``The purpose in life is not to be 
happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to 
have it make some difference that you lived and lived well.''
  These fine officers laid down their lives protecting the community 
that they loved. They lived their lives honorably, with compassion, and 
dedicated to serving and making a positive difference in the lives of 
others. Simply stated, Lieutenant Hoosock and Officer Jensen truly 
lived well.
  I pray that we may all live our lives worthy of their sacrifice. May 
their service and sacrifice never be forgotten. May God bless them, and 
may God bless their loved ones.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. Ezell), another veteran of law enforcement.
  Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Williams for yielding time.
  Mr. Speaker, this April, two families received that call that no law 
enforcement leader ever wants to make. Onondaga County Sheriff's 
Lieutenant Michael Hoosock and Syracuse Police Officer Michael Jensen 
were shot and killed in the line of duty.
  I rise to honor and remember their legacies and to share my 
sympathies and my prayers with the loving families they leave behind. 
As a former sheriff and a 42-year law enforcement officer, I want to 
make it abundantly clear that the sacrifices made by Lieutenant Hoosock 
and Officer Jensen are not in vain. Like countless other officers from 
upstate New York to south Mississippi, they put on the badge and went 
out into their community to protect and serve, putting themselves in 
harm's way because they believed in right and wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, one of the things you learn very quickly during a career 
in law enforcement is that the families of our officers serve alongside 
them. Parents, siblings, spouses, and children each make tremendous 
sacrifices because of their loved one's service to their community. 
None is as difficult as the sacrifice the families and friends of these 
two heroes have made.
  My heart breaks for you and the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office and 
Syracuse Police Department and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing 
Lieutenant Hoosock and Officer Jensen. My prayers, as well as the 
prayers of this body and the entire Nation, are with those loved ones 
as you grieve.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for America to wake up. Wake up, America, and 
realize what is going on in this country. Our law enforcement officers 
are dying. Families are suffering. However, know that we are here with 
you and will always be as we pray God bless you and give you comfort.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
words.
  I yield to the gentlewoman from Utah (Ms. Maloy).
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express gratitude and 
reverence for our law enforcement community. Self-governance, like what 
we have in this country, is a meaningless exercise without the 
enforcement of our laws. Enforcement of the law requires men and women 
who step forward, put their lives on the line, and serve as guardians 
over you, me, and our families. They do this never knowing when they 
might need to give their last measure of devotion for us.
  I express my deepest condolences to those who loved Syracuse Police 
Officer Michael Jensen and Onondaga County Sheriff's Lieutenant Michael 
Hoosock, who died tragically in a shoot-out.
  Over the weekend, as I prepared to rise in solidarity with my 
colleagues from New York and my colleagues who are veterans of law 
enforcement, I found out that we had a similar tragedy in Utah. Just 
yesterday, we lost one of our own officers.

[[Page H2867]]

  Santaquin, Utah, Police Officer Sergeant Bill Hooser left behind a 
bride of 29 years, two daughters, a granddaughter, and a devastated 
Utah law enforcement community.
  Sergeant Hooser's shift yesterday started like it did probably every 
day. He couldn't have known this was his last watch. He was tragically 
killed in the line of duty, the duty of protecting Utahns and our 
freedoms.
  My deepest condolences and prayers to Sergeant Hooser's family. We 
are grateful for what he did in his life.
  My good friend, Sheriff Curtis, of Sevier County, Utah, summed up 
some of my feelings. He said: When we lose someone who has made it 
their life's purpose to make a difference for good, we all lose a small 
piece of who we are as a community and as a Nation.
  I rise today to make sure that families like the Hooser family in 
Utah, the family who is sitting in the gallery right now, know that 
America recognizes and appreciates their sacrifice. I thank you on 
behalf of Utah's Second Congressional District and make sure you know 
that you are not alone.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her words.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
Fischbach).
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Williams for putting 
together this Special Order this evening, and I thank Cait Hoosock for 
being here today. I am so deeply sorry for your loss and the loss of 
Officer Jensen.

  Every day, our law enforcement officers leave for work, and their 
families can never be certain if they will return home. Know that I am 
grieving with you and praying for you and your family.
  The increase in violence we have seen against law enforcement in 
recent years is unacceptable. As Mr. Stauber mentioned, this year in 
Minnesota, two officers and a firefighter were killed when a man they 
were negotiating with opened fire without warning.
  Last year, in my district, Deputy Josh Owen was killed when 
responding to a domestic violence call. His name will be added to the 
memorial next week.
  Mr. Speaker, the attack on law enforcement must stop. All of these 
officers gave their lives protecting their communities. Every time we 
hear another story like this, our hearts break all over again.
  Our law enforcement deserves our gratitude and our respect. I am so 
disappointed to see many people, including some in this Chamber, trying 
to make our brave officers into villains. I stand in support of law 
enforcement, and my Republican colleagues, like you have seen this 
evening, are doing everything we can to pass legislation to protect and 
thank our officers.
  I know that, because of this disgusting movement of hatred toward our 
officers, we must, but our voices need to be strong. We must support 
law enforcement.
  I have introduced legislation to encourage the recruitment of the 
next generation of law enforcement through a grant program. I have 
supported legislation to empower officers to do their jobs effectively, 
and I have asked the Judiciary Committee to investigate the 
weaponization of government against law enforcement.
  I will continue to do everything in my power to support our police 
officers because they support all of us. God bless all of our law 
enforcement officers, and I thank them for the job that they do.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her words.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Williams) for bringing us here today to recognize Lieutenant Michael 
Hoosock and Officer Michael Jensen, two heroes who gave of themselves 
in service to our community.
  As the Bible teaches us: ``Greater love has no man than this, than to 
lay down his life for his friends.''
  Lieutenant Hoosock and Officer Jensen laid down their life in defense 
of our community to ensure the safety and the well-being of our 
residents. They answered the call of duty and went above and beyond and 
made the ultimate sacrifice. It wasn't just a sacrifice they alone 
made. It was a sacrifice that their families made.
  To Cait, Nicole, Samuel, and Gabriel, there are no words that will 
make this better. There are no words that will make this okay. We 
grieve with you. Our heart breaks for you, and we will be here to 
support you.
  This morning, I spent time at the Brinks robbery memorial for slain 
Nyack Police Sergeant Edward O'Grady, Police Officer Waverly Brown, and 
Brinks guard Peter Paige. Nearly 43 years ago, they were killed in the 
1981 Brinks robbery. Nine children were left fatherless.
  Every year, we gather on October 20 to remember those two officers 
and security guard who died in that horrific robbery. Additionally, 
every year, one by one, their killers were released.
  We have seen in New York, over the last 6 years, 37 cop killers 
released. The depraved indifference for law enforcement is 
unconscionable because the reality is, if we don't respect law 
enforcement, if we don't respect the rule of law, there is no society. 
The reason we have seen a rapid increase in crime in New York is 
precisely because there is no respect for the rule of law, and people 
do not believe there are consequences for actions.
  Cashless bail will go down as the single stupidest policy that has 
ever been signed into law anywhere. Since that law took effect, over 40 
percent of those that have been arrested for a felony offense and then 
released under cashless bail have been rearrested for committing 
another offense.

                              {time}  2030

  You look at cashless bail, you look at Raise the Age, the HALT Act, 
Clean Slate, and the continued parole for unrepentant cop killers, and 
as a result we have a lawless society.
  Last year, $4 billion in retail theft. Why? Because quality of life 
crimes aren't prosecuted any more in New York. We let people walk right 
out of the store with whatever they want.
  The lawlessness must come to an end. Respect for law enforcement, 
putting victims above criminals is essential. Without it, we will 
continue to be in this place where cops are murdered and taken away 
from their families.
  It is why as a member of the State legislature I introduced a bill 
that would ensure life without the possibility of parole, pardon, or 
clemency for killing a law enforcement officer. If we cannot respect 
our law enforcement officers, if we cannot stand up for them and ensure 
their safety as they stand up for all of us and ensure ours, then we do 
not deserve a safe and just society.
  To the family of Lieutenant Hoosock and Officer Jensen, we will 
continue to fight for justice for you and to ensure that other families 
don't have to endure this horrific tragedy.
  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, to the Hoosock family and to 
the Jensen family, I promised that those two would be honored by our 
Nation, that they would be honored in this esteemed place, and that you 
too would be recognized and honored. Mr. Speaker, I thank them for 
honoring us with their presence.
  I am grateful to each Representative who spoke this evening. Somber 
times like these invite us to reflect and to take a closer look at many 
things that so often we take for granted.
  There exists in this world profound evil, manifesting itself in many 
ways. What stands between that evil and innocent people? Every single 
day, the men and women serving in law enforcement across America stand 
courageously in that treacherous place.
  As you go about your day in safety, in comfort, the vigilance of 
these men and women may fade into the background, but to them and to 
their families, the risk inherent in their line of work never fades. 
They clock in every day with the knowledge that they place themselves 
in heightened danger whenever they put on that uniform, and they do so 
for our sake.
  We are privileged to forget, to enjoy the safety and comfort that are 
a direct result of their labor, but we are obliged to remember. Times 
like these remind us forcefully, tragically, that evil and danger are 
ever present, but that heroes still exist amongst us. They are heroes 
like Lieutenant Michael Hoosock, heroes like Officer Michael Jensen, 
heroes like every single man and woman behind the badge and

[[Page H2868]]

in front of all decent folks they protect and serve, and their 
families.
  I thank them for joining us today.
  To America, I would say, if you know any folks that serve in law 
enforcement, right now is a good time to thank them. Our police 
officers, firefighters, EMS, and their families dedicate their lives so 
that we may be safe. Recognizing the commitment and sacrifice they 
voluntarily make is something we all can and we should do. Words may 
only accomplish so much, but they do mean something. Convey it to those 
around you as you see them, that you recognize their sacrifice, and 
that they are not alone and not forgotten.
  I will start by thanking Caitlin Hoosock and her children--Nikki, 
Gabe, Sam--who I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know today. I thank 
them for joining us. Once again, I humbly speak, for everyone here and 
for everyone watching, that you are not alone.
  Mr. Speaker, I have concluded this Special Order, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

                          ____________________

 SHINING A LIGHT ON MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND SUICIDES AMONG BLACK 
                                 YOUTH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.


                             General Leave

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order hour.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Illinois?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I, too, acknowledge the 
tremendous loss that those families have incurred, and I thank them for 
their service.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to co-anchor 
this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, along with my 
distinguished colleague, Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick.
  For the next 60 minutes, members of the Congressional Black Caucus 
have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people on the 
topic of mental health, an issue of great importance to the 
Congressional Black Caucus, the Congress and the constituents we 
represent, and all of America.
  Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey, the honorable Congresswoman Watson Coleman.
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois 
for yielding and organizing this Special Order hour on what I think is 
a very important topic.
  Five years ago, I founded and chaired the CBC's Emergency Task Force 
on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health.
  Mental health emergencies and suicides among young Black youth have 
been on the rise, but this troubling trend had gone mostly unnoticed 
outside of the mental health field. Steadily and quietly, our children 
were dying, succumbing to depression, anxiety, and loneliness.
  So I and several of my colleagues, who will speak here tonight, came 
together to get to the bottom of this problem. We brought in experts, 
including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, 
school administrators, and students to help us paint a picture of this 
problem.
  The picture was grim.
  Between 2007 and 2020, a Black child died by suicide every 3 days. 
The suicide rate among Black youth ages 10 to 17 increased by a 
staggering 144 percent. Among young children ages 5 to 12, Black youth 
were twice as likely to die by suicide, and the suicide rate for 
teenage girls increased by almost 7 percent each year.
  These findings would make anyone sick to their stomach.
  It inspired the task force members to write the Pursuing Equity in 
Mental Health Act, which would surge funding to the National Institutes 
of Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities, and to develop an outreach and education plan to reduce 
the stigma associated with mental health conditions and substance 
abuse.
  Flash forward 5 years and the devastating impact of COVID has brought 
this crisis to everyone's attention. The social isolation, the constant 
fear of getting sick, and watching loved ones die have taken an 
unparalleled toll on all of us.
  Our Nation suffered a collective trauma made up of millions of 
individual crises.
  However, the pandemic fell especially heavily on Black women. The 
expectation of Black women to be pillars of their families and 
communities, combined with the greater likelihood of being essential 
workers increased the vulnerability to both physical and mental health 
problems.
  As a result, 50 percent of Black women experienced elevated levels of 
depression and 20 percent reported experiencing severe psychological 
distress. While other groups rebounded steadily after the pandemic, 
unemployment among Black women stayed high, even increasing at times 
when overall unemployment was falling. This persistent unemployment 
created additional stress on already struggling communities.
  It is our responsibility to ensure that overburdened communities, 
especially in impoverished urban and rural areas of the country, have 
access to mental health care.
  Since the task force was convened, we have addressed bits and pieces 
of this issue like improving and simplifying the process of accessing 
the suicide crisis hotline by calling 988, but so much more work needs 
to be done.
  Our children have been given neither the tools to maintain their 
health nor the care that they need to cope.
  It does not have to be this way. Children who have access to help can 
thrive. They have shown an ability to bounce back and become strong, 
happy, and resilient; to be active and productive in their communities. 
We have the capacity to create the conditions in which all of our 
children have a shot at happy, fulfilling lives.
  No matter your race, your background, or your gender, each one of us 
wants--no, indeed, we pray--for our children to grow up healthy. We 
must have and we need our Black women to be mentally and physically 
equipped to provide that growth that is so necessary.
  When we see them struggle, we struggle. When they are in pain, we 
feel that pain deeply. We know this to be true; Democrats, Republicans, 
and Independents, it doesn't matter what your party affiliation is.
  Yet here we are. Fifty-two months after the introduction of the 
Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act and 7 months after the 
introduction of the Youth Mental Health Research Act, bipartisan bills 
to get our children the care they so desperately need, and we still 
can't come together.
  Look around the country. People are fed up with this Congress, the 
least productive Congress in decades. Surely, we can come together for 
the sake of our children. I implore my colleagues to take this 
situation seriously, to put aside our differences, and to show our 
children that we care and get them the help that they need.

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable Bonnie 
Watson Coleman, Congresswoman from the great State of New Jersey in the 
12th District, for her remarks.
  Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the gentleman from 
the great State of Nevada, the honorable chairman of the Congressional 
Black Caucus,   Steven Horsford of the Fourth Congressional District.
  Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, good evening. I thank Jonathan Jackson for 
co-anchoring this important discussion on tonight's Special Order hour 
for the Congressional Black Caucus and to Representative Sheila 
Cherfilus-McCormick for her tremendous leadership on all of our Special 
Order hours.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional 
Black Caucus to recognize the month of May as Mental Health Awareness 
Month.
  I thank Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for her tremendous 
leadership on this very important issue, as well as each of our members 
for their work in addressing mental health, specifically in the Black 
community.

[[Page H2869]]

  Today, it is estimated that one out of every five American adults 
experiences mental health illnesses each year.
  In the United States, 21 percent of Black Americans reported having a 
mental illness, however, just 39 percent received mental health 
services.
  In recent years, the suicide rate among Black youth has been found to 
be increasing faster than any other racial or ethnic group.
  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide 
is now the third leading cause of death for Black male adolescents and 
young adults in our country.
  Over the last 30 years, we have seen a 160 percent rise in the 
suicide rate for young Black men. The statistics regarding mental 
health in the Black community are alarming, yet it has received very 
little attention from this Congress.
  So it is time for us to address mental health and, in fact, to focus 
on mental wellness, the same as in any other health issue. It is time 
to remove the stigma that too often surrounds mental health, especially 
for members of our community who are less likely to receive mental 
health care services to begin with.

                              {time}  2045

  This means addressing the systemic economic barriers our community 
faces to mental health care services, the lack of culturally competent 
care, and the root causes of declining mental health, including racism 
and implicit biases in daily life, high poverty rates, disparate 
economic participation, and low access to quality psychological and 
psychiatric services.
  It also means addressing the lack of diversity in our healthcare 
system. Often, when Black patients seek mental health services, they 
prefer a same-race healthcare professional, who are vastly 
underrepresented in this space.
  As legislators, we have a responsibility to the communities that we 
serve to find solutions to longstanding disparities that negatively 
impact our communities and to ensure that no one gets left out or left 
behind.
  As we can see, the research is clear, and the crisis before us is 
urgent. There are solutions. My colleague, Representative Watson 
Coleman, discussed just two that are bipartisan and have the support of 
Members on both sides.
  I know that there are efforts to pass bills in days when the majority 
wants them to, and we are asking you to make mental health the 
priority, especially in this month.
  In order to remedy these disparities, reverse these trends, and save 
lives, we have to address them head-on by providing access to better 
and more affordable healthcare, improving economic conditions in our 
communities, and moving toward more culturally competent and evidence-
based care.
  We have to take action now. Lives are on the line. It is possible. It 
can be done by focusing on Mental Health and Wellness Month in a way 
that lifts up all communities and the services and support that they 
need.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable   Steven 
Horsford from the Fourth Congressional District of the great State of 
Nevada.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman).
  Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jackson for his 
leadership on this very important issue.
  Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I worked in education for 
20 years. I started my career as an elementary school teacher in the 
South Bronx before becoming a high school dean of students and guidance 
counselor and before having the privilege of opening my own school and 
running it as a middle school principal for 10\1/2\ years.
  The year before I decided to run for Congress, 34 children died 
within the K-12 school system in the Bronx, and 17 died via suicide. No 
one was making the connection between these horrible outcomes for our 
children and families with the historical neglect and trauma of their 
communities and the policies that come not just from local government 
or State government but also from the Federal Government.
  As mentioned by Chairman Horsford, it is incredibly difficult to 
access mental health resources in historically marginalized communities 
because of historical underfunding and historical neglect.
  It is tremendously urgent and incumbent upon us here in the House of 
Representatives to pass transformational, revolutionary legislation as 
it relates to supporting the mental health of every single person in 
our country. We need to make sure that we are not simply passing 
legislation but that we are also providing the resources and funding to 
build out the mental health ecosystem so that we can have more 
professionals working within the mental health system as professionals 
supporting the American people, particularly those who are most 
vulnerable.
  A couple of weeks ago, we introduced the Improving Access to Mental 
Health Act, which seeks to invest many more resources into our 
minority-serving institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions, and 
historically Black colleges so that we can build out the mental health 
programs in these particular institutions.
  We need more counselors. We need more psychologists. We need more 
psychiatrists. We need trauma specialists. We need many more mental 
health professionals in our schools and communities.
  When we make these investments, what we see is a dramatic decrease in 
the number of people who are incarcerated in our communities because 
many of the people who are incarcerated suffer from mental health 
challenges that have gone untreated.
  Many of the people who are incarcerated have experienced intense 
trauma, what professionals call toxic stress and chronic trauma, in 
their lives that needed to be responded to by a mental health 
professional, but it never was. As a result, they then commit harm in 
their communities. When they are going through harm within their own 
bodies and minds and spirits without receiving the care that they need, 
they are more likely to commit harm.
  Investing in our mental health as part, I might add, of a universal 
healthcare system dramatically decreases the costs for our jail and 
prison system, decreases the costs for our overall healthcare system, 
and improves education and economic outcomes. It is a win-win-win-win 
when we pass legislation as it relates to mental health and invest in 
supporting our children and families with their mental health.
  I will close with this. I mentioned toxic stress and chronic trauma. 
We have certain communities in our country--rural and urban, 
historically underserved, historically underfunded, historically 
marginalized, and historically neglected--because of lack of access and 
opportunity, many of those communities have been redlined on purpose by 
this very institution.
  When children are born into those communities, they are much more 
likely to experience toxic stress and chronic trauma.
  Mr. Speaker, when our babies from prenatal to age 3 experience toxic 
stress and chronic trauma, do you know that the prefrontal cortex of 
the brain doesn't develop accordingly? As a result, their regulatory 
skills, as well as their higher thinking skills, are compromised, which 
leaves them more likely to experience an adverse mental health event or 
to be diagnosed with a mental health condition. It also makes them more 
likely to be placed in special education in our school system and makes 
it more likely for them to be a part of the school-to-prison pipeline.

  That is why it is not just about investing in mental health. It is 
about investing in universal childcare and universal pre-K because when 
we invest in universal childcare and universal pre-K, we are ensuring 
our kids are growing up and are nurtured in the most nurturing 
conditions imaginable, and they are less likely to experience the 
stress and trauma that I talked about.
  When they don't experience the stress and trauma, their prefrontal 
cortex develops properly, which leads to better education and economic 
outcomes and keeps them off the school-to-prison pipeline.
  Investing in our mental health is a matter of national security. If 
we really care about foreign countries and how they are maybe 
responding to us and spying on us and kicking our butts when it comes 
to technology, when we invest in all Americans, especially the most 
vulnerable ones, we are going to

[[Page H2870]]

have incredible economic, social, and health outcomes on the back end.
  I thank Representative Jackson for his leadership and for allowing me 
to say a few words.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable 
Congressman Jamaal Bowman for those insightful words.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Amo).
  Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue that is 
critically important for Rhode Islanders and for all Americans: the 
need for greater investment in our mental health care system. The topic 
is timely, of course, especially as we recognize May as Mental Health 
Awareness Month.
  Here in Congress, we have a duty and responsibility to act on mental 
health. We must reduce the stigma associated with mental health while 
ensuring that it is both taken seriously and seriously addressed.
  That is why I am proud to join my colleagues in the Congressional 
Black Caucus tonight as we shine a light on the current state of mental 
health in America. Together, we are committed to reducing disparities 
and access, expanding coverage for mental health care, and reversing 
trends that have worsened over the past few years.
  First, we must be clear-eyed about the numbers. Right now, one out of 
every five Americans is struggling with mental illness. Think about 
that. These are our neighbors, friends, coworkers, and loved ones.
  Yet, as we acknowledge that mental health conditions are far more 
common than we think, we must recognize that different communities have 
different levels of access to treatment. As I have said, one out of 
every five Americans lives with a mental illness, a number that remains 
roughly equal when broken down amongst race and ethnicity. However, 
despite Black communities reporting relatively equal rates of mental 
illness, the percentages of them receiving mental health services 
register far lower than their fellow Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that mental health is an issue that does not 
discriminate. It does not see color or background, and it affects 
struggling Americans the same. Yet, access to care is not the same for 
all Americans. Simply put, the barriers are higher for Black Americans, 
whether it is because of stigma for seeking help or lack of accessible 
and affordable providers.
  It is clear that we must do more to bring down those barriers. After 
all, if we are to live up to the words of our founding document, 
``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,'' then we must close the 
racial disparities in coverage and treatment, particularly as Americans 
are experiencing rates of loneliness so high that the Surgeon General 
has declared it a public health crisis.
  Congress must lead by example. To that end, I am proud to lift up 
legislation that would expand investments for mental health in schools 
and reduce racial gaps in treatment. I thank Congresswoman Bonnie 
Watson Coleman for her leadership on the second point.
  However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my home State of Rhode 
Island as a model to be aware of. I am thankful for the work of 
committed nonprofits like the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island 
and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Rhode Island.
  Our State was recently named the fifth best State for mental health 
care in America, but that is not enough.
  Over the past year, we have seen enormous progress on this front due 
to increased State-level advocacy and initiatives that ensure and 
increase access.
  Yet, as we highlight these protections being codified into law, we 
must keep up our efforts to close the equity gaps in our system.
  Every American, no matter the color of their skin or the background 
that they come from, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
  Every patient, regardless of what they are struggling with, deserves 
the support and services they need to live their best lives. By asking 
and listening to each other, by arming ourselves with the facts, and by 
using them to push for greater access to care, we can make a real 
difference in the mental health of Americans all across our country.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, again, for their leadership and 
for hosting this critical Special Order tonight.

                              {time}  2100

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable 
Congressman from the great State of Rhode Island, Congressman Gabe Amo, 
for his remarks.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because in the midst of the sound and 
fury of our current political climate, there remains a profoundly 
unaddressed and underestimated crisis raging in the hearts and homes of 
this country's African-American citizens.
  It is a melancholy truth that too often what ails the hearts and 
minds of Black people in this Nation goes unnoticed. Thankfully, May is 
Mental Health Awareness Month, and we are therefore afforded the rare 
opportunity to acknowledge and address the mental health of African 
Americans as we would any other health crisis that threatens our 
quality of life.
  While it is true that the mental health of any community must be of 
grave importance, since none of this Nation's social or economic 
benefits can truly be appreciated apart from peace of mind, in the case 
of African Americans, however, the effects of the long history of 
systemic and outright political terror must be of singular importance.
  It must be of singular importance because life has become more 
complicated, alienation has become more common, and political violence 
has become more threatening. The times in which we live necessitate a 
greater emphasis and consideration of the mental health of this 
country's most vulnerable citizens.
  At a time when social media proliferates our lives with doomscrolling 
and mean world syndrome, we would be foolish to underestimate the 
impact and influence of what living in the digital age happens to be 
doing to our minds.
  I rise tonight because it is time for us to raise greater awareness 
about the confluence of mental health issues stalking two generations 
of African Americans like never before.
  I rise tonight because we must henceforth remove the stigma of openly 
dealing with a public health issue we cannot avoid. The time for our 
accommodating silence must come to an end. The time for us to assign 
shame is over.
  The time for us to portray Black people as super-human protagonists 
who move through the American drama unbothered and unaffected must be 
challenged in every way. Black people are as human as everybody else. 
We suffer from death, dread, disease, and despair like every other 
community. We may be strong and we may be resilient, but we are not 
without the scars and stripes that any community with our history would 
have to bear.
  Perhaps there was a time when we were unaware of what the effects of 
mental health were doing to our very lives and our bodies, but now we 
know that one out of every five American adults are now suffering from 
some mental health crisis or concern.
  We know that in the United States of America, 21 percent of African 
Americans reported struggling with mental illness, and we also know 
that just 39 percent of them received the mental health services that 
they deserve.
  Subsequently, it should not surprise us that in recent years the 
suicide rate among African-American young people has increased faster 
than other racial or ethnic groups. It should not surprise us that 
young people across racial lines are suffering with anxiety, various 
forms of dysmorphia, and other issues at rates never seen before in the 
long history of this great country.
  According to the Department of Health and Human Services minority 
office, African-American adults are more likely than White adults to 
report persistent symptoms of emotional distress, such as sadness and 
feeling like everything is an effort. In fact, according to the same 
findings, Black adults living below the poverty line are more than 
twice as likely to report serious psychological distress than those 
with more financial security.
  What this shows us is that the negative mental health of Black people 
in this country is often the result of a devious and devastating 
confluence of issues. That is to say, members of the

[[Page H2871]]

Black community, in addition to dealing with social media, the human 
predicament, and a history of repression, must also face the kind of 
structural racism that creates barriers to being able to access the 
care and treatment they both need and deserve.
  It is no wonder, then, that only one of every three African Americans 
living with a mental illness receive any kind of treatment at all. Only 
one in three. Additionally, in 2020, it was reported that 10 percent of 
African Americans still do not have health insurance and are among the 
chronically uninsured. Even with the Affordable Care Act firmly in 
place--and thank God that we have it--we must do more to get members of 
the Black community insured. They need both access and the 
affordability of care.
  It should not be the case that just a little over 10 percent of the 
Black community still cannot get the medical services they require. The 
overall survival of Black people in this country is far too contingent 
and tenuous for them not to have this one area of certainty in their 
life, access to care and mental health care.

  Needless to say, without insurance, treatment for mental illness is 
as unlikely as it is statistically uncommon. These are some of the 
unique challenges Black people face in an effort to live beyond the 
choking grip of mental illness, and that is why this month of awareness 
is so important.
  The victims of mental illness should not have to fight this battle 
alone. They should not have to struggle in the shadows of American 
life, and Black people in this country who struggle with mental illness 
should not have to bear this cross with crowns of thorns while all the 
world goes free.
  If every community is susceptible to the vicissitudes of mental 
illness, then certainly every community should have equal access to the 
things that make for peace.
  The current disparity in access to care is as unacceptable as it is 
un-American. I say to every African American suffering from mental 
illness, you have nothing to be ashamed of. You have done nothing 
wrong. You are not guilty of anything, and you need not be shamed into 
greater levels of unnecessary suffering.
  Let the word go forth from this moment forward, mental illness is a 
health concern compounded by social factors and not the result of a 
deficiency in character or personal responsibility. People are not 
suffering from mental illness because they are bad people. And to be 
sure, people are not suffering from mental illness because they are 
somehow ethically weak or deficient in their capacity to try harder, as 
it were.
  We have to stop assigning responsibility to the victim when it comes 
to mental illness the way we used to do with drug addiction and the 
like. Mental illness could care less about how emotionally strong or 
morally consistent you are. There is a reason why we call it an 
illness, and we call it an illness because all of us are potentially 
susceptible to falling victim to it under the right set of tragic 
conditions and circumstances.
  To the millions of people in America, and particularly to the 
millions of African Americans, who are suffering from mental illness, I 
see you, I hear you, I honor your courage, I value your life.
  Perhaps, most of all, I stand in solidarity with the possibility of 
your healing. You are not alone in this time. Your struggle and your 
sacrifices have not gone unnoticed, and we stand in this solemn place 
to affirm the dignity of your persistent efforts to be heard and 
recognized by your government.
  I want you to know that your labor has not been in vain. Today, we 
ask faith leaders in the Black community to help us remove the stigma 
that prevents people from getting therapy and treatment. Church 
leaders, mosque leaders, and synagogue leaders are essential elements 
for the successful recovery of someone getting the help they need.
  Prayer and spirituality can help in the effort to eradicate isolation 
and give victims access to communities of healing, but these benefits 
must be supported by proven treatments.
  There is no reason the Black church and Black mental health 
professionals cannot work together to bring relief and restoration to 
the millions of Black people who need it.

                              {time}  2110

  Today we call upon the formation of a broad and interdisciplinary 
approach to mental illness that will not only address the problem but 
also leave the dignity of the person intact because struggling people 
are still people, citizens of this country.
  Men and women who, in spite of the difficulties they face, are no 
less worthy of our love and our devotion because this country is only 
as strong as the weakest among us.
  A country that cannot secure the health and well-being of the weak 
will never be able to protect and sustain the longevity of the strong.
  I am convinced that we must do everything in our power to support the 
expansion of culturally competent care.
  In fact, this government should incentivize the practice of creating 
an army of Black mental health professionals who work on the front 
lines in this emerging war because whether we know it or not, the 
future of this Nation and our communities might well depend upon it.
  This is not a crisis in the making. This is a crisis already amongst 
us, and what we do about this issue might well determine the direction 
of this meandering Republic in days and years to come.
  Let us gather the best of the American spirit to accomplish this 
work. Let us summon the proverbial angels of our better nature.
  Let us join hands and lock arms and dedicate our resources so we 
might preserve all notions of domestic tranquility and let the 
oppressed go free.
  Mr. Speaker, you have heard from my distinguished colleagues about 
the topic of mental health and all issues of great importance to the 
Congressional Black Caucus, our constituents, Congress, and all 
Americans tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kindness, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

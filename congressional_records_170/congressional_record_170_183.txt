RECOGNIZING GRACE NUHFER AS OHIO'S 13TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CHAMPION 
                              OF THE WEEK

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. EMILIA STRONG SYKES

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Grace Nuhfer as 
Ohio's 13th Congressiona] District Champion of the Week.
  This summer, Grace won a silver medal in the 100-meter butterfly at 
the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. She also set personal bests in 
multiple events, including the 200 meter individual medley, 50 meter 
freestyle, and 100 meter backstroke.
  Despite being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and brittle 
cornea syndrome, conditions that impact her joints and vision, Grace 
has not allowed these physical challenges to hinder her success in 
athletics and academics. Her drive to succeed is commendable. Grace has 
much to be proud of and deserves the utmost respect for her 
accomplishment.
  Grace earned her spot in the 2024 Paralympic Games by taking flrst 
place in the 100-meter butterfly at the U.S. Paralyrnpic Swimming 
Trials. Additionally, her exceptional performances at the Parapan 
American Games and the U.S. Paralympic National Championships leading 
up to the 2024 Paralympics established her as one of the top swimmers 
in her classification.
  Grace is not only a renowned Paralympic swimmer, but also a college 
senior at the University of Akron, studying data analytics with a focus 
on marketing. She is on the university's swim team and is the school's 
first Paralympian.
  Again, I would like to congratulate Grace on this amazing 
accomplishment and commend her for her hard work and dedication, it is 
those like Grace who make Ohio's 13th District the birthplace of 
champions.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR JOHN ZARAGOZA AND HIS REMARKABLE SERVICE TO THE CITY 
                         OF OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize John Zaragoza, 
the esteemed Mayor of the City of Oxnard, for his outstanding and 
unwavering commitment to public service, which has positively impacted 
the lives and livelihoods of all who call this vibrant community home.
  Throughout his remarkable career, John has been a dedicated public 
servant and his work on an array of projects and initiatives have 
shaped the city for future generations. For almost three decades, he 
has faithfully served our community, proving himself to be a tireless 
advocate for the people of Oxnard. From his time on the Oxnard City 
Council from 1996 to 2008, to his tenure on the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors from 2008 to 2020, and as Mayor of Oxnard since 2020, John 
has worked relentlessly to address the city's most pressing needs.
  During his time in office, John has led efforts to improve public 
infrastructure, expand community services, and enhance the quality of 
life for residents. He has played an instrumental role in addressing 
the region's evolving transit and infrastructure needs. From street 
restorations to park maintenance to pipeline replacements to sidewalk 
repairs, John has delivered critical investments that have helped 
maintain and fortify the city's timeless character, all while ensuring 
that its residents have safe and equitable access to the resources they 
need to survive and thrive.
  John has also been a steadfast champion for children and families. As 
Supervisor, he established the Nyeland Acres Center, an invaluable 
community resource providing after-school and family services. In 
recognition of his advocacy for the Nyeland Acres community, the County 
Board of Supervisors dedicated the John C. Zaragoza Community Park in 
his honor.
  John's commitment to improving the quality of life for Oxnard's 
residents has been evident in his hands-on approach to engaging with 
constituents and driving community projects that directly respond to 
their needs.
  A long-time resident of Oxnard, John has a deep and personal 
connection to the city and its people. His life story is a testament to 
his dedication to service and to the betterment of the community. He 
has consistently led with integrity, humility, and a fierce commitment 
to making Oxnard a better place for all.
  I must also acknowledge the unwavering support of his wife, Mary 
Ellen Zaragoza, who has been a steadfast partner in John's public 
service journey. Mary Ellen's dedication and commitment to their shared 
vision for the city have been instrumental in his success. Her support, 
both in public and behind the scenes, has been a pillar of strength 
throughout the years, and together, they have made an indelible impact 
throughout the city.
  As John steps down from his role as Mayor, I am proud to join our 
community in acknowledging his immeasurable contributions to our region 
and expressing our gratitude for his outstanding public service. It has 
been my sincere privilege to work alongside John throughout my career 
in Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I recognize 
Mayor John Zaragoza for his invaluable service to the City of Oxnard, 
and I join the people of Oxnard in wishing him all the best in his 
future endeavors.

                          ____________________

                   HONORING HAROLD AND INEZ RICHARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEBBIE LESKO

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Harold and Inez 
Richards, who are wonderful, loving, patriotic constituents of mine 
that live in Sun City, Arizona.
  Hal and Inez's patriotism started years ago. Harold, also known as 
Hal, enlisted in the United States Air Force in May 1955. Inez and Hal, 
high school sweethearts, married in 1956. They raised two sons, Bruce 
and Eric, and like many military families, lived throughout the U.S. on 
military assignments.
  Hal's military career included serving as the personal pilot for the 
Iowa Army National Guard's Regiment Commander, graduating from fixed 
wing flight school as number one in his flight class, serving two tours 
in the Vietnam war, including as 1st lieutenant assigned to the 1st 
Cav's CH47 battalion, serving as Inspector General for the 1st Army 
Headquarters located at Fort Meade, MD, and serving as Professor of 
Military Science at Sam Houston State University before military 
retirement in 1984.
  After military retirement, Hal and Inez ran a successful business, 
owned by Inez, called EJR Enterprises that sold custom sportswear 
throughout the country. They ran the business until they moved to 
Arizona to take care of Hal's Uncle and Aunt and have been involved in 
the Luke Air Force Base Retired Officers Association and helping and 
supporting Arizona elected officials, like myself, ever since.
  I thank Hal and Inez Richards for their lifetime of dedication to our 
country and for their friendship and kindness to me. May God continue 
to Bless them now and in future years.

  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in honor of Police Officer 
Thomas Joy from the Suffolk County Police Department to recognize his 
achievement in receiving the 7th Annual U.S. Attorney General's Award 
for Distinguished Service in Community Policing. This achievement is 
not only a testament to Officer Joy's incredible exceptional skills and 
bravery but also to his relentless dedication to making Suffolk County 
a safer place for all of us to live, work, and raise our families.
  Officer Joy has consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of the 
challenges facing

[[Page E1244]]

our community and a remarkable ability to address them through 
proactive and community-oriented policing. His work embodies the 
principle that public safety is not just about enforcement but also 
about building trust and fostering collaboration between law 
enforcement and the residents they serve. Suffolk County could not be 
prouder to have Officer Joy amongst its ranks.
  In New York and on Long Island, we know the value of a strong and 
dedicated police force. Officer Joy's efforts to combat crime, protect 
vulnerable individuals, and improve the quality of life in our 
neighborhoods have left an indelible impact on our community. We owe 
him a debt that we could never repay.
  On behalf of the people of Suffolk County and the 1st Congressional 
District of New York, I offer my heartfelt congratulations and deepest 
gratitude to Officer Thomas Joy for his outstanding service and his 
unwavering commitment to justice and public safety. His contributions 
to Suffolk County serve as an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to 
honor his remarkable achievements here today.

           HONORING THE LANSING REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the Lansing Regional Chamber 
of Commerce, a vital institution that has provided transformative 
leadership to Greater Lansing, Michigan, since 1901. Over that time the 
Chamber has worked tirelessly to help businesses connect, grow, and 
thrive, while also strengthening local communities and fostering an 
equitable and vibrant economic landscape.
  Through its advocacy, programming, and partnership, it plays an 
instrumental role in making the Lansing region one of the best places 
to live and work in Michigan. By collaborating with corporate 
executives, small business owners, elected officials, and local 
leaders, the Chamber drives initiatives that promote shared success.
  The Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce's focus on equity, reflects 
a commitment to creating an inclusive environment where all individuals 
and businesses can thrive together. By providing resources, mentorship, 
and professional development opportunities, the Chamber is helping to 
shape a future that celebrates and supports diverse and equitable 
communities. Initiatives like ATHENA Lansing exemplify this mission by 
empowering women to achieve leadership and professional growth, 
ensuring that their voices are at the forefront of progress.
  What sets the Lansing Regional Chamber further apart is its belief in 
bipartisanship and its ability to unite people across political and 
ideological lines. The Chamber consistently brings together 
stakeholders from all walks of life to find common ground for the 
benefit of the entire region. Its leadership in tackling issues like 
infrastructure, housing, education, and healthcare has established it 
as a trusted voice and a force for positive change. We need more 
practical, common-sense, solution-oriented influence in our civic life, 
and I applaud generations of Chamber leaders for their work to put 
community interest ahead of politics.
  For over 100 years, the Chamber has provided valuable tools and 
resources to members, helping them navigate challenges, innovate, and 
succeed. By fostering a stronger, more connected, and supportive 
network of businesses and individuals, it has enriched communities and 
left an indelible mark on the Greater Lansing area.
  It is with great respect and gratitude that I recognize the Lansing 
Regional Chamber of Commerce and its outstanding contributions and 
enduring legacy of service here in the official record of the People's 
House.

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kate Dean for her 
years of public service to the Jefferson County community. As a member 
of the Jefferson County Commission, Commissioner Dean demonstrated 
unparalleled leadership and advocacy for the Jefferson County community 
as she prepares to step down from the Commission.
  Commissioner Dean moved to Jefferson County, Washington in 1999 and 
spent 10 years farming and working to grow the local food economy 
through small business development, including co-founding FinnRiver 
Farm and Mt. Townsend Creamery. She also started a consulting business 
that focused on natural resource and economic development issues both 
locally and across the region. Later, she served as the Regional 
Director for the North Olympic Development Council.
  Commissioner Dean was then elected to the Jefferson County Board of 
Commissioners in 2017 representing Port Townsend. While on the board, 
she became a driving force for rural economic development and 
environmental sustainability in the county. She has been behind 
groundbreaking work that has bridged public, private, and nonprofit 
sectors tackling complex rural issues.
  Outside of our region, the impact of Commissioner Dean's efforts has 
been felt around the state. In 2023, Governor Inslee appointed 
Commissioner Dean to the Washington State Board of Health, where she 
advocated for rural healthcare issues and access. She also serves as a 
member of the Leadership Council for the Puget Sound Partnership.
  Commissioner Dean has been a staunch advocate for public funding of 
major infrastructure projects, increased access to supporting housing, 
and overall economic growth in a county that desperately needs it. And 
this advocacy has led to record levels of public investment, including 
successful Community Project Funding wins for the Port Hadlock Sewer 
and Caswell-Brown Emergency Shelter and Supportive Housing Projects. 
The impact of Commissioner Dean's work has been profound and will have 
lasting impacts for years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I have been grateful for Commissioner Dean's leadership, 
partnership, and friendship--and I applaud her for her successes in 
working to make her community stronger. Commissioner Dean's leadership 
and passion for revitalizing rural Jefferson County has forever 
impacted the future of the communities she served. Her advocacy and 
energy will be sorely missed.
  For these reasons, I am pleased to recognize Commissioner Kate Dean 
in the United States Congress.

        THOMAS R. CARPER WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, December 9, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the ``Thomas 
R. Carper Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.'' I would 
like to thank Ranking Members Larsen (D-WA) and Napolitano (D-CA) and 
Chairs Graves (R-MO) and Rouzer (R-NC), as well as their committee and 
personal office staffs, for crafting the bipartisan ``Thomas R. Carper 
Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.''
  This is the sixth consecutive biennial WRDA since 2014, continuing 
the bipartisan tradition of enacting a new WRDA every two years that 
meets the water infrastructure needs of communities across the country. 
This year's WRDA will strengthen community resilience in addressing the 
climate crisis, improve water resource projects that safeguard human 
health, and enrich America's vital natural ecosystems.
  The legislation before us today would not have been possible without 
the leadership of my longtime friend and incredible public servant, 
Ranking Member Grace Napolitano. Since 2014, Ranking Member Napolitano 
has led the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, helping 
protect our communities from droughts, restore our ecosystems, and 
invest in America's ports and harbors. While her presence on the Water 
Resources and Environment Subcommittee will be missed, her commitment 
to protecting America's water supply will benefit countless communities 
for years to come.
  The ``Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024'' (S. 4367) 
includes key priorities for Solano and Contra Costa Counties, the Bay 
Area, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and all of California's 8th 
Congressional District. As a senior member of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, I was pleased to secure several provisions in 
this bill to create local jobs by directing new federal investment into 
Mare Island, restore Bay Area wetlands, bolster water supply for local 
communities in California's 8th Congressional District, and more.
  Specifically, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024'' 
(S. 4367):
  Expands on my ongoing work to support the redevelopment of Mare 
Island by directing the Army Corps to complete a feasibility study with 
the City of Vallejo to deepen the Mare Island Strait Channel;
  Addresses the impact of sea level rise on the San Francisco Bay Area, 
by authorizing

[[Page E1245]]

the Army Corps to complete a comprehensive study focusing on the 
effects of sea level rise on disadvantaged communities in the Bay Area;
  Helps restore Bay Area wetlands in San Pablo, Grizzly, Honker, and 
Suisun Bays by requiring the Army Corps to use at least 70 percent of 
dredged materials;
  Fortifies Contra Costa County's water supply by authorizing $57 
million in federal funding for water supply projects in central Contra 
Costa County by the Delta Diablo and Ironhouse Sanitary Districts;
  Further supports the crucial use of recycled water in the East Bay by 
investing an additional $20 million to the East Bay Municipal Utility 
District's East Bayshore Recycled Water Project and Integrated Recycled 
Water Program; bringing in a total of $45 million invested in the 
District;
  Helps restore the Sacramento River floodplain by directing the Army 
Corps to use natural infrastructure in all Army Corps projects;
  Incorporates key provisions from my ``Abandoned and Derelict Vessel 
Removal Act'' (H.R. 7719), expanding the Army Corps' ability to remove 
abandoned and derelict vessels on the shoreline.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with the Chairs and Ranking 
Members, and my colleagues from both parties to get this timely 
legislation to President Biden's desk for signature by the end of the 
calendar year.

                          ____________________

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my consultant, 
Brian Murray, for his years of service to me, our state, and our 
Nation.
  Prior to consulting, Brian worked on Capitol Hill for multiple 
members, including his last role as Chief of Staff to former U.S. 
Representative Rick Renzi. Brian also worked in the U.S. Senate as a 
staff member on the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology and 
Space and on numerous statewide, congressional, and independent 
expenditure committees.
  Brian was essential in my quest to become a member of Congress and 
served as a confidant throughout my tenure. No matter the challenge, 
Brian was already ready to fight and guide me through even the most 
difficult of days.
  I cannot thank Brian enough for his commitment and dedication to me, 
my district, our state, and our Nation.

  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Nancy Reichman, 
Professor Emerita at the University of Denver. On December 4, 2024, Dr. 
Reichman received the Joyce and Kal Zeff Humanitarian Award, a well-
deserved recognition of her dedicated work in academia and to our 
community.
  Dr. Reichman worked in the Department of Sociology and Criminology at 
the University of Denver for 40 years. Her commitment to education and 
to the Denver community had a profound impact on undergraduate students 
at the University of Denver over the years. During Dr. Reichman's time 
at the University, her research areas included financial regulation, 
workplace regulation, and white-collar crime.
  Dr. Reichman's commitment to the Jewish community is evident through 
her dedication to relaunching the Jewish Family Services' Refugee 
Resettlement program. This program assists refugee families in finding 
affordable housing, providing food and mental health counseling, and 
supporting overall efforts to acclimate to life in the United States. 
She also sits on Denver's Racial Equity Council and works alongside her 
colleagues to address systemic inequalities and racial inequity in our 
state.
  Dr. Reichman's work in academia and across our community created 
lasting changes in Colorado. I join many others in extending my 
gratitude for her service to our state.

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the very large number of 
members who have learned and become more educated on important subjects 
on Aspen Institute study trips for the past years, we honor the service 
of Carrie Rowell, who has worked with members of Congress from both 
sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol for the last 14 years. 
Carrie has worked diligently as the Conference Director for the Aspen 
Institute Congressional Program, a nonprofit working to bring members 
of Congress together with policy experts to solve the greatest 
challenges of our time around the world.
  The Aspen Congressional Program conducts several bipartisan, 
bicameral conferences around the world throughout the year. Carrie, as 
Conference Director, has been responsible for all logistics and 
operations of these conferences, including monitoring late or missed 
flights for 65 plus conference participants, making sure site visits 
and educational sessions stay on time, and always personally greeting 
and sending members back to the United States with a smile. This 
stalwart programming has been instrumental in many members forming 
working relationships with each other that might not otherwise exist.
  Before the Aspen Institute, Carrie had a distinguished career in 
journalism, communications, and conference operations. She was the 
conference coordinator of a University of Maryland journalism 
foundation, press secretary for former Representative for South 
Carolina, Butler Derrick, and media relations manager for the Federal 
Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and First Union Corporation of South 
Carolina. She started her career as a political reporter for a North 
Carolina daily newspaper and was editor of a South Carolina weekly 
newspaper. A native of Charlotte, North Carolina, Carrie graduated from 
St. Andrews University.
  Carrie has led with poise, grace under pressure, and kindness for the 
last 14 years. She expresses these valuable traits at all times to 
members of Congress, her colleagues, and all those around her, whether 
before a 5 a.m. flight or after a long, 12-hour day.
  We thank Carrie for her years of service and wish her the best in 
retirement.

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of 
Scott Perkins as he retires from his role with the San Ramon City 
Council.
  Scott has spent his life serving his country and his community. He 
attended the US Naval Academy and earned his BS in Mechanical 
Engineering before serving five years in active duty with the Navy. 
During this time, he spent 3 years aboard the USS Gray as a First 
Lieutenant, Assistant Navigator, and Missile/Gunnery Officer and 2 
years serving as an Instructor at the Landing Force Training Command 
Pacific. Scott remained in the Naval Reserves serving in a variety of 
roles before he was called back into active duty to support Operation 
Desert Storm. He served in Germany, Turkey, and Iraq assisting with 
refugee support activities. Scott retired from the Armed Forces in 2005 
with the rank of Captain, serving more than 34 years in uniform. Scott 
continued to serve his Nation with his acquired expertise, moving into 
an engineering role at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In this 
role, Scott worked as the Resource Manager and Facility Manager for the 
X-Ray Laser Program, served as a Test Engineer for the SLBM Weapon 
Protection Program, and supported the Lab's Nuclear Materials 
Surveillance Program. He retired from the Lab after 36 years of 
dedicated service and continues to consult for their Weapons Complex 
Integration program.
  Scott has also demonstrated his steadfast commitment to our community 
and improving the lives of San Ramon residents. He was first elected to 
the San Ramon City Council in 2003, where he has worked to maintain the 
financial health of the City and improving quality of life in San 
Ramon. He served as chair of the City's Finance Committee and played a 
key role in renovating and expanding San Ramon's library. Beyond his 
work on City Council, Scott has been instrumental in supporting local 
Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Having earned his rank of Eagle Scout at the 
age of 13, Scott went on to serve as Den Leader and Cubmaster for the 
pack at Montevideo Elementary School and was a founding leader of Troop 
84. He has led backpack trips in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and has 
mentored over 100 Eagle Scouts.
  Throughout his life, Scott has bravely served his country and has 
worked tirelessly to empower members of our community. Please join me 
in congratulating Scott Perkins on his well-deserved retirement after 
decades of public service.

            CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ROBERT DUMAS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. JONATHAN L. JACKSON

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
life and legacy of Robert Dumas. Mr. Dumas was a beloved father, 
brother, and friend, who passed away peacefully in his home on November 
24, 2024.
  Born on April 5, 1939, in Safford, Alabama to his parents, Andy and 
Queenie Dumas, Robert was known all his life for his warm heart, sense 
of humor, and deep love for his family.
  Robert held many jobs throughout his life but was most proud of 
becoming an owner of a trucking company where he operated an 18-wheeler 
truck. In 1980, he founded the Dumas Trucking. His work brought him 
great joy, and he poured his heart into the work that he loved.
  After a long day at work, Robert enjoyed the simple things in life 
and would often relax in his recliner while watching Westerns. He was 
an old-fashioned man who appreciated every moment of life. He was a 
friend to all. Robert was affectionately referred to as ``Joe'' by his 
brothers, sons, grandsons, close friends, and nephews because of his 
pleasant, easy to approach demeanor.
  Throughout his life Robert was a devout Christian who lived a life of 
faith and service to his church, Messiah Temple Missionary Baptist 
Church. He served as a Deacon, a member of the Brotherhood, and a 
cherished member of the men's chorus until his health failed. His 
service and spiritual counsel as a beloved member of his church 
community will not be soon forgotten, nor will the sound of his voice 
with his chorus partners.
  Robert was devoted to his family and his final message to us was ``In 
your hearts, always remember me as the gentle giant and love me as I 
always loved you. To me, and to all who knew me, `family is and will 
always be everything.' ''
  He is survived by his children: Robert Dumas, Dorothy Wash, Donna 
Dumas, Tony Wash (Kim), Christopher Zorich, Cedric Dumas, and Tiffany 
Beard (Edward). He is also survived by his siblings, James Dumas 
(Lucy), Alice Allen, Maple Moppins, Quennie McEwen, Daisy Moore 
(Ezekiel), and Ann Cole. He will be lovingly remembered by all his 
family, including his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a host of 
friends.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in remembering the life 
and legacy of Mr. Robert Dumas and in sending our deepest condolences 
to his family and friends at this time.

                       HONORING PASTOR TOM BEERS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM BANKS

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tom Beers, the longtime 
pastor of Columbia City Church of the Nazarene and my own childhood 
pastor, as he retires at the end of this year.
  Born in Elkhart, Indiana, Pastor Tom grew up in the church and 
accepted Jesus as his Savior at the early age of five. After graduating 
high school and marrying his sweetheart, Deborah Goble, he began to 
feel the call to full-time ministry. In 1976, he enrolled at Olivet 
Nazarene College with only $250 in his pocket, a new job at Arby's, and 
faith that God would provide for him and his young family.
  Pastor Tom graduated in 1982 and began his pastoral journey as an 
associate pastor at the Lansing Church of the Nazarene in Illinois. He 
went on to serve as the senior pastor at the Brookfield church for 
three years and the Waukesha, Wisconsin, church for another three 
before moving to Columbia City in 1991.
  Since then, Pastor Tom's leadership has guided Columbia City Church 
of the Nazarene, establishing it as a steadfast beacon of faith in the 
community. Under his care, the church has flourished as a sanctuary of 
worship, spiritual growth, and fellowship. Pastor Tom's vision and 
dedication have shaped a congregation deeply committed to both local 
outreach and global missions, creating a legacy within the community 
and beyond.
  Jeremiah 3:15 states: ``Then I will give you shepherds after my own 
heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.'' Pastor 
Tom's ministry has been a testament to the heart of a shepherd, 
providing wisdom, guidance, and love to countless lives--including my 
own.
  As he prepares to depart from his current role, I wish Pastor Tom 
many joyful years ahead to cherish time with his family, enjoy the 
community he has called home for so long, and cheer on his Indiana 
Hoosiers. His remarkable life of service, faith, and leadership will 
continue to inspire all who have been touched by his ministry.

                         TRIBUTE TO SARA PETERS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TOM COLE

                              of oklahoma

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sara Peters, an 
exceptional staff member of the House Committee on Appropriations, 
whose decade-long service in the federal government exemplifies the 
hard work and dedication of an esteemed public servant.
  Sara's career in government began in 2010 as Legislative Counsel to 
Senator Thad Cochran. In that role, she advised the Senator on budget, 
banking, finance, trade, justice, and ethics issues. Her contributions 
were particularly significant in the vetting of judicial nominees and 
the development of landmark legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act and 
the Budget Control Act of 2011. Additionally, Sara managed all justice-
related appropriations issues for the influential Senator.
  In 2011, Sara brought her talents to the House Committee on 
Appropriations as a Professional Staff Member for the Subcommittee on 
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. Her portfolio included 
the Federal Highway Administration and transportation safety agencies, 
such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the United 
States Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. She also managed vital 
programs supporting Native American housing, homeless assistance, and 
community development.
  Following her initial tenure with the House Committee on 
Appropriations, Sara expanded her expertise in the private sector as a 
Senior Associate at the King & Spalding law firm. Sara specialized in 
environmental, energy, transportation, and consumer product safety law. 
She then served as Assistant General Counsel at the Volkswagen Group of 
America, with a specific focus on emissions, regulatory, and settlement 
oversight.
  After five years in the private sector, Sara's commitment to public 
service led her back to government as the Deputy Director of Government 
Affairs, Policy, and Strategic Planning for the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. Focusing on transportation safety 
initiatives and technologies, Sara bridged the gap between the agency 
and Congress, managing key policy initiatives and preparing agency 
leadership for congressional hearings, budget rollouts, and briefings.
  In November 2020, Sara returned to Congress where her extensive 
expertise and knowledge earned her the position of Counsel and Senior 
Advisor on the House Committee on Appropriations under then Ranking 
Member Kay Granger. It was in this role that Sara successfully advanced 
House Republican funding priorities in the Minority. When Republicans 
took control of the House in 2023, she was rightly promoted to Deputy 
Staff Director of the full committee. Her understanding of the 
complexities of the federal budget has fostered crucially important 
reforms in the appropriations process. She has demonstrated remarkable 
skill in managing complex budget data, coordinating between the twelve 
Appropriations subcommittees, and facilitating communication with 
leadership offices, authorizing committees, external stakeholders, and 
support agencies such as the Congressional Budget Office and the 
Government Accountability Office. Sara played an invaluable role in 
crafting and negotiating full-year, supplemental, and continuing 
appropriations legislation.
  Throughout her career, Sara has consistently demonstrated an 
extraordinary ability to navigate complex political landscapes and 
achieve meaningful results on challenging policy issues. Her deep 
understanding of government processes and her strategic approach have 
been instrumental in securing important policy victories, even in times 
of a divided government.
  After countless early mornings and late nights of devoted work to our 
country, I know Sara is looking forward to a change of pace that allows 
her to spend more time with her family. Sara will be greatly missed, 
and I extend my deepest gratitude for her exemplary service to the 
United States of America.

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Senior 
Advisor, Bryan Doyle, for his work on behalf of every constituent in 
Minnesota's Third Congressional District. I could not be more proud or 
grateful for his service.
  Bryan is an experienced leader, executive coach and strategic analyst 
with a proven track record of effective counsel across multiple 
industry sectors. His service, first as my Communications Director and 
then as my Senior Advisor, has been invaluable. Bryan taught our entire 
team how communications builds influence, influence builds power, and 
power moves policy.
  Bryan has coached business executives, college professors, 
Congressional staff, students, and fast-food workers in strategic 
policy communications. A lifelong campaign professional, Doyle's skills 
as a community organizer complement his ability to communicate and 
problem-solve with diverse audiences with overlapping interests.
  Bryan secured press bookings on Politically Incorrect with Bill 
Maher, The Today Show, NPR's Morning Edition, Good Morning America, and 
several hits for multiple shows on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. He led the 
charge for my successful Let's Grow! Caucus-wide campaign for 
Democratic Policy and Communications Committee co-chair in 2022, to 
which his skills in communications were critical. He has since taken on 
tech policy for the office, with a special emphasis on artificial 
intelligence, labor, international competition and small business.
  Bryan brings a fresh and outside the box perspective when looking at 
the long-term trajectory of the office. His love of music and lyrics 
especially lightens the mood on tough days. He is willing to put 
himself out there, even dressing up as Teddy Roosevelt to bid farewell 
to a dear colleague on his last day in the office. Bryan brought his 
authenticity to work every day. My office wouldn't be the same without 
his zeal, sharp mind and propensity to break out in song.
  Bryan often says, ``peace and love are action words,'' and I'm 
grateful he lent his considerable talents to our mission to inspire 
more of both in Congress during his 3 years on my team. His colleagues 
and I will miss his booming voice and big heart.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have his dedication and leadership. I wish Bryan all the best in his 
future endeavors and thank him for three years of faithful service to 
this Nation.

             COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF VINCENT OMAR LEGGETT

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JOHN P. SARBANES

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of 
Vincent Omar Leggett, a tireless advocate for the Chesapeake Bay and 
the founder of the Blacks of the Chesapeake Foundation.
  Vince Leggett was a devoted historian and conservationist whose 
passion for the Chesapeake Bay was unmatched. Through his leadership of 
the Blacks of the Chesapeake Foundation, Vince shed light on the untold 
stories of Black life along the Bay and brought new depth to our 
understanding of the Bay's heritage.
  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Vince's family, friends and all 
who knew him. His commitment to the Chesapeake community inspired 
countless individuals--including myself--we will honor his memory by 
continuing his vital work to protect and celebrate the Bay and its 
diverse communities.
  I include in the Record an article by Christine Condon.

`He Was the First': Vincent Leggett Remembered as a Singular Voice for 
                  Black History of the Chesapeake Bay

                         (By Christine Condon)

       Carnelious Jones was volunteering aboard the Amistad, a 
     replica of the historic cargo schooner, when Vince Leggett 
     walked into his life.
       Jones, whose company had donated fuel to the Amistad, had 
     been told that an ``admiral'' would board the vessel before 
     it sailed into Baltimore's Inner Harbor. So Jones, a Navy 
     veteran, expected a stern military man in uniform--not the 
     sedan that pulled up nearby (several minutes late), and the 
     jovial man who climbed aboard in a white captain's hat.
       That was Vince Leggett, who had been named an Admiral of 
     the Chesapeake Bay in 2003 by then-Gov. Parris N. Glendening. 
     He was the third Black person to receive the honor, 
     recognizing a lifetime of service to the Nation's largest 
     estuary.
       ``I saw that he had done some astonishing things,'' Jones 
     said. ``So, I approached him and I shook his hand, I told him 
     I was happy to meet him, and thanked him for his 
     accomplishments.''
       When the ship reached the shore, Leggett brought Jones to 
     his tent, featuring artifacts he'd collected for his book 
     about the Black history of the Chesapeake Bay. Jones was 
     enthralled.
       ``I'm from the south--in Tennessee,'' Jones said. ``I was 
     amazed at just how outspoken everything was, and how much 
     development as it relates to the African American story was 
     so publicized and so published.''
       Vincent Omar Leggett died Nov. 23 at 71-years-old. A pillar 
     of the Anne Arundel County community, who served on the 
     school board, directed the Annapolis housing authority and 
     even became the first Black chaplain of the Annapolis fire 
     department, Leggett was perhaps best known for his work on 
     the Chesapeake Bay.
       Beginning in the 1980s, through his foundation, Blacks of 
     the Chesapeake, Leggett gathered and preserved the legacy of 
     Black bayside communities, watermen, captains, seafood 
     industry workers, and sail makers. For Leggett, it began with 
     the recognition that the history books often omitted these 
     stories. So, he told them himself, penning ``The Chesapeake 
     Bay Through Ebony Eyes,'' and serving for decades as an 
     encyclopedia of the Bay's Black legacy.
       ``He wanted everybody else to know that it was more. We 
     were just not shucking them oysters,'' said Jones, the vice 
     president for new business development at Blacks of the 
     Chesapeake. ``We had contributors, to this day, into this 
     maritime industry.''
       Leggett also had stints at the Maryland Department of 
     Natural Resources, as chairman of the Wiley H. Bates Legacy 
     Center, as a board member for the Seafarers Yacht Club of 
     Annapolis, and on the list goes. Friends remember him as a 
     talented historian and orator, who also served as a lobbyist, 
     an advocate, and perhaps above all--a leader.
       Leggett was also the driving force behind a successful 
     decades-long effort to preserve the historic Elktonia-Carr's 
     Beach Heritage Park, the last remnant of the Black-owned 
     beach land that welcomed Black families during segregation, 
     and hosted music legends such as Ella Fitzgerald and Aretha 
     Franklin.
       Along the way, Leggett inspired a new generation of 
     historians and environmental advocates, forging a path for 
     Black voices where none existed before, said R. Kenyatta 
     Rowel Jr., CEO of Breaking Boundaries Environmental, a 
     Maryland-based environmental restoration firm he started in 
     2022.
       ``Vince paved the way as a trailblazer for all of these 
     activities, all of these places and spaces for people like 
     me.'' Rowel said. ``He was the first.''
       Rowel remembers a recent event he attended with Leggett at 
     the Whitehall Plantation near Annapolis. For Rowel, who grew 
     up nearby in a historically African American community called 
     Mulberry Hill on the Broadneck Peninsula, the event was 
     already special. But Leggett made it even more so.
       ``He was talking on the mic, and he introduced me and my 
     company to have a few words. And to me, that was a moment I'm 
     never going to forget,'' Rowel said.
       For Leggett, it began with his upbringing in Baltimore, and 
     family trips fishing and boating on the Chesapeake Bay, Jones 
     said. The experiences tied him to the outdoors, and were the 
     first spark for his eventual effort as a historian.
       ``It wasn't a research project. It was part of his 
     livelihood,'' Jones said, ``That's the difference.'' Though 
     he grew up in Baltimore, where he also earned his bachelor's 
     degree from Morgan State University, Leggett ultimately built 
     his life in Anne Arundel County. He and his wife Aldena lived 
     in Arundel-on-the Bay enclave in Annapolis, according to an 
     online biography, where they enjoyed ``beautiful bay views, 
     fishing with their grandchildren and planning their next trip 
     to the golf green.'' For Jones, that day aboard the Amistad--
     a reproduction of the ship famous for its 1839 slave revolt--
     began a yearslong partnership and friendship with Leggett, 
     focused on achieving shared goals for the Bay's Black 
     community and its legacy.
       He looks back fondly on their frequent early morning phone 
     calls, beginning as soon as 4 a.m. and continuing for 90 
     minutes--or until Leggett left to make his wife coffee or 
     breakfast as she headed off to work, Jones said.
       To this day, Jones and others marvel at Leggett's ability 
     to balance it all. The early morning and late evening 
     meetings, the positions on countless boards and committees, 
     the appointments with legislators, community members and 
     advocates.
       ``There are people every now and then that come through, 
     that--it's unexplainable,'' Jones said.
       Much of Leggett's legacy lives on in the vast array of 
     artifacts he amassed amid decades of research on the Bay's 
     Black history. Today, much of the collection is stored in 
     warehouses, but it is being digitized and shared publicly 
     online, thanks to a partnership with the Maryland Archives.
       To Leggett, the history of the Bay should include not only 
     Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, but everyday Black 
     Marylanders, who let him into their homes--and into their 
     worlds. In a way, he became their representative--their 
     messenger, Jones said.
       ``The ones that passed, he would put a book inside of their 
     coffin. The family would give

[[Page E1248]]

     him the artifacts of the waterman,'' Jones said. ``They 
     trusted that he would do something with it.''
       In the archives, Leggett himself, and his foundation, is a 
     part of the history. In 2000, the Library of Congress 
     designated the foundation as a Local Legacy Project.
       The archive includes not only artifacts and images 
     documenting Black life in the Bay region, but also 
     documenting Leggett and his foundation--photos of him at a 
     book release or a boat show, examples of exhibits and more.
       ``He had collected a large collection at that time. Papers, 
     posters, his own personal documents, correspondence with 
     different officials, really chronicling the 30-year history 
     of Blacks of the Chesapeake,'' said Corey Lewis, assistant 
     state archivist at the Maryland Archives.
       ``You couldn't tell the story without Vince,'' Lewis said. 
     For the past several years, interns from local universities 
     have helped document the collection, conduct research and 
     find places to put the artifacts on display, Lewis said. 
     Leggett made a point of working with each intern directly, 
     pointing out figures in photos and telling their stories, 
     ensuring the online collection would be complete, Lewis said. 
     ``He could have just given us the collection. But he found it 
     important--we found it important--for him to come in, sit 
     down and spend time with them,'' Lewis said.
       Joel Dunn, president of the Chesapeake Conservancy, said he 
     was incredibly proud to work alongside Leggett to preserve 
     Carr's Beach, a crowning achievement for Leggett's legacy.
       Today, the beach is set to be transformed into public 
     parkland. The more recent acquisition--a home on the 
     property--could become a visitor center. Dunn believes it 
     should bear Leggett's name.
       Getting the land was far from simple, Dunn said, as the 
     waterfront properties were incredibly valuable. It took 
     millions, including from local government, the Conservancy 
     and Blacks of the Chesapeake, to save the land from another 
     fate, such as residential development. Leggett, who had an 
     existing relationship with landowners and a proven track 
     record of preservation, was instrumental in sealing the deal.
       ``Vince was so knowledgeable about that history, and all 
     the acts that played there. And the years and months that 
     they played,'' Dunn said. ``He just was such a great 
     storyteller. That, I think, was a really key part of winning 
     over the landowner and the elected officials and garnering 
     the resources we needed.'' There is a particular memory of 
     Leggett that still plays on in Dunn's mind. It was Juneteenth 
     this year, when Leggett planned a celebration at Carr's 
     Beach--complete with music acts, a fish fry and fried 
     chicken. And there Leggett was, in the middle of it all, 
     dancing on the very beach that he helped preserve. ``Now, 
     multiple generations ever after Vince Leggett will be able to 
     experience that place and learn about that place and 
     experience that history, because of his hard work and 
     passion,'' Dunn said. ``I'm so glad he got to enjoy that. I 
     wish he had more time.''

               TRIBUTE TO CHAIRWOMAN KAY GRANGER OF TEXAS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to join my colleagues to pay 
tribute to a true pioneer in the House of Representatives.
  My good friend Kay Granger has been a trailblazer since she was 
elected in 1991 as the first female Mayor of Fort Worth, Texas. Just a 
few years later, in 1997 she was elected as the first Republican woman 
to represent Texas here in the House.
  It's been a privilege to work beside Kay for more than a quarter 
century. Whether it was advancing American space exploration or 
enhancing our national security, Kay has always fought for our country 
and for Texas.
  In 2017, Kay was named Chair of the House Defense Appropriations 
Subcommittee. As the first woman to chair the subcommittee, Kay always 
put the needs of our warfighters first, advocating that our military 
must have the advanced capabilities necessary to deny our adversaries a 
fair fight.
  In 2022, Kay was selected to be the Chair of the House Appropriations 
Committee--making her the first Republican woman to lead the Committee. 
As a member of the Committee and her successor on the Defense 
Subcommittee, I saw first-hand how effective she was at collaborating 
with fellow Appropriators, navigating an always contentious process to 
achieve our shared goals to the benefit of taxpayers and our Nation.
  I will miss serving with Kay in the House as well as on the 
Appropriations Committee. I already miss her since she is no longer my 
neighbor here in Washington--but I know she is looking forward to being 
back home in Texas, and I wish her and her family the very best in the 
future.
  I thank Kay, for making this institution and our country a better 
place.

                          ____________________

      INTRODUCING THE DECEPTIVE DOWNSIZING PROHIBITION ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Deceptive 
Downsizing Prohibition Act of 2024 (DDPA). This vital piece of 
legislation empowers the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect 
consumers and small businesses against deceptive downsizing, the act of 
maintaining a product's packaging while reducing the content size. By 
defining deceptive downsizing as a prohibited unfair and deceptive 
practice, the FTC can pursue an action against a manufacturer of a 
consumer product who deceives everyday Americans and businesses on Main 
Street.
  DDPA bans the deceptive downsizing of consumer products, making it 
unlawful for manufacturers to sell products of reduced size, volume, or 
weight in packaging previously used for the same or similar product of 
a larger size. Holding manufacturers who engage in this deceptive 
practice accountable will protect consumers and small businesses.
  The practice of deceptive downsizing has become a significant concern 
for American households, particularly during times of economic 
uncertainty. Food, personal care items, and household products that 
Americans rely on most are particularly impacted by this deceptive 
practice. As manufacturers reduce the size or weight of products while 
maintaining the same exterior packaging, consumers are left with less, 
often for the same or even higher price.
  Most disturbingly, many consumers do not realize that the item they 
purchased was smaller than expected because the packaging looked the 
same, further intensifying the financial burden on hard-working 
Americans. Honesty in packaging is essential in enabling consumers to 
make informed choices, and misleading the public is unacceptable.
  This is not simply an issue of safeguarding the wallets of 
Americans--it is about fairness. When hardworking American consumers 
and businesses shop, they expect the product that comes in the same 
size packaging will remain the same size. When that happens, consumers 
and small businesses rightly feel duped. I am introducing this 
legislation to ensure that no American family or business is deceived 
and getting less than expected.
  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this crucial 
legislation that will help protect American consumers and businesses 
from the practice of deceptive downsizing so they will know that when 
they buy a product, they get what they expect and deserve.

                          ____________________

Headquarters. He became a Warrant Officer in 2009 and deployed to 
Afghanistan in 2012 with the 289th EN Co.
  His education includes an associate degree in Survey and Design from 
East Central Community College, where he played football, a certificate

family: his wife of 24 years, Karen; their sons, Jarrott (JJ) and 
Clifton (CJ); daughter-in-law, Madison; and their respective pursuits 
in contracting, medical school, and college.
  Chief Banks embodies dedication to family, service, and community. He 
is a true American hero and a proud Mississippian, and we are deeply 
grateful for his service.

               CONGRATULATING TIM BETE ON HIS RETIREMENT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Tim Bete, an outstanding 
community leader and close friend from my Congressional district, who 
is stepping down as president of St. Mary Development Corporation. St. 
Mary Development is a faith-based, nonprofit organization in Dayton, 
Ohio that provides affordable housing for low-income seniors and 
families.
  As president, Tim Bete has successfully carried the torch lit by 
Sister Rose Helene Wildenhaus and Dayton businessman Dick McBride, who 
formed St. Mary Development Corporation in 1989. Tim had worked closely 
with them for seven years, until they retired in 2013 and turned the 
management of the organization over to him. Under Tim's leadership, St. 
Mary has continued its focus on creating affordable housing and 
connecting residents to the services they need.
  Since its founding, St. Mary Development Corporation has created 70 
affordable apartment communities with nearly 5,000 housing units, 
including low-income senior apartments, single-family homes and 
emergency housing, and $580 million in real estate investment.
  From my time as mayor of Dayton, and throughout my service in 
Congress, I have strongly supported St. Mary's efforts to revitalize 
the community by creating affordable housing for the poor and elderly. 
I was proud to collaborate with Tim to secure resources for a pair of 
senior housing facilities, with priority placement for veterans, on the 
grounds of the Dayton VA Medical Center. These facilities provide safe, 
secure, and affordable housing for veterans, and easy access to the 
medical care they need.
  Tim has dedicated his entire career to making affordable housing 
available to people who need it. He has served on the boards of housing 
and homelessness organizations and a nursing home, and currently serves 
on LeadingAge Ohio's housing subcommittee. Tim is a graduate of the 
Achieving Excellence in Community Development at Harvard University's 
Kennedy School of Government, and has an MBA from Indiana University.
  Tim Bete has worked tirelessly to make his community a better place 
to call home. I wish him all the best in a well-deserved retirement. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in thanking this truly outstanding citizen 
for his lifetime of service to our community.

             HONORING SONOMA COUNTY SUPERVISOR SUSAN GORIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Supervisor Susan Gorin who is retiring after an extraordinary career of 
dedicated public service representing the residents of the City of 
Santa Rosa and the County of Sonoma. Her career is marked by a 
commitment to conservation, to the public's access to parks and to 
hardening our community against the threat of natural disasters.
  Born in Massachusetts and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Ms. 
Gorin later moved to Sonoma County where she attended the Santa Rosa 
Junior College and Sonoma State University. In 1991, she earned a 
degree in Political Science and Economics which set her on a path 
toward public service. She also established her family in our 
community. In Santa Rosa, Ms. Gorin married her husband Joe Gorin and 
raised her two children, Tracey Gorin and Courtney Taylor.
  Ms. Gorin's elected and appointed service spans nearly three decades 
with roots in city governance. Her journey began in 1996 when she was 
elected to the Santa Rosa City Schools Board of Trustees. Ms. Gorin 
would go on to serve on the City of Santa Rosa's Board of Public 
Utilities in 2002 and Planning Commission in 2004. Following those 
posts in City Hall, Ms. Gorin ran successfully to serve as a member of 
the Santa Rosa City Council. In 2008, her colleagues on the Council 
appointed her Mayor. She would lead the city through the tumultuous 
years of the Great Recession.
  In 2012, Ms. Gorin ran successfully to represent the residents of 
Sonoma County's 1st Supervisorial District. Her district includes the 
eastern portions of Santa Rosa, the Mayacamas Mountains, the Sonoma 
Mountains and the Sonoma Valley. She was reelected in 2016 and 2020 and 
was chosen by her colleagues to serve as Chair of the Board in 2015 and 
2020. Additionally, throughout her three terms as supervisor, she has 
been a tireless advocate for vulnerable and underrepresented 
communities.
  In 2017, our community was devastated by wildfires that raged 
throughout California--many lost their homes, and some lost their 
lives. Ms. Gorin is one of the survivors of the fires having lost her 
home to the Nuns Fire. In addition to leading her family's recovery, 
she has been a fierce advocate for fellow survivors. She continues to 
advocate for fire recovery and resiliency policy.
  During her twelve years as a supervisor, Ms. Gorin has served on 
numerous regional government boards, including the Sonoma County 
Transportation Authority, the Regional Climate Protection Authority, 
the Bay Conservation Development Commission, the Sonoma Marin Area Rail 
Transit Board, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, the Local 
Agency Formation Commission, and many others.
  Mr. Speaker, Supervisor Susan Gorin's legacy of public service, her 
unwavering commitment to our community and her efforts to improve the 
lives of those she serves exemplify the best of local government 
leadership. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my longtime friend 
and consultant, Chad Willems, for his years of service to me, our 
state, and our Nation.
  Chad Willems has managed hundreds of campaigns and public opinion 
surveys at both the local and national levels. His work has spanned 
various political offices, from school boards to members of Congress.
  Before establishing himself in Arizona, Willems was heavily involved 
in California politics, particularly as a grassroots organizer and 
political fundraiser. He also served as the Executive Director of the 
Adam Smith Institute, a conservative/libertarian think tank, before 
transitioning to consulting.
  Chad has been one of my closest confidants throughout my time in 
Congress and I am fortunate to have had his counsel during this 
important time.
  I cannot thank Chad enough for his commitment and dedication to me, 
my district, our state, and our Nation.

  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a poem 
submitted at the request of a Virginia Beach constituent, Rabbi Dr. 
Israel Zoberman of Temple Lev Tikvah, and are a reflection of his 
views:

                     The Sacred Lights of Chanukah

     The fragile yet formidable Chanukah candles
     We tenderly lit, daringly defy the suffocating
     Darkness around us and in us,
     Soothing and softening, we pray, all who
     Their magic of evoked memories of elation
     And trepidation with oil--dripping levivot
     (Potato pancakes) for expectant levavot
     (Hearts) while partaking of sustaining sweet
     Sufganiyot (donuts) to counteract the bitterness
     Of previous and following defeats,
     Celebrating a temporary victory before the
     Hasmonians' intra-feuds hastened the demise
     Of short-lived Jewish sovereignty with warning
     Lessons for the contemporary scene of mounting
     Extremism and spreading strife,
     With hostages in death-filled Gaza darkness
     Still-second Chanukah's Festival of Lights
     In captivity, how tragically ironic!--desperately
     Yearning for liberating light lagging too long
     Behind and may not come, and for too many
     Their wondrous light already snuffed out by
     Those adoring the dark with the candle of each
     Unique life burning down before its time and
     Forever lost is that consecrated inner oil,
     Though only we, today's brave Maccabees,
     Possess the priestly power to extinguish

[[Page E1250]]

     The miracle of the bright Chanukia (menorah)
     Embedded deep within us.

  Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is the founder of Temple Lev Tikvah in 
Virginia Beach. Kazakhstan's only born rabbi, he is the son of Polish 
Holocaust Survivors and spent his early childhood in transit and DP 
Camps in Austria and Germany. He grew up in Haifa, Israel.

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Vivica A. Fox, a 
Hoosier trailblazer whose six decades in the arts has helped shape 
American culture.
  Celebrated for her memorable roles in ``Independence Day'' and ``Set 
It Off,'' Vivica solidified her career as a prominent figure in 
Hollywood from a young age. Her journey to success began with the 
``Days of Our Lives'' soap opera and later the NBC-TV series ``The 
Young and the Restless.'' Her continued dedication to her craft as a 
lead actor has filled a much-needed gap in the entertainment industry 
for representation of Native American and Black communities. Vivica has 
inspired and uplifted her heritage throughout her career. This week, 
she is in Indianapolis for the Red Carpet Screening & Talkback for the 
film The Lost Holliday, a new project she proudly joined to explore and 
the challenging dynamics of grief, family and overcoming obstacles. She 
shines in this new endeavor, where she continues to inspire the next 
generation of artists and audiences.
  Known as, ``the diva who's done it all,'' Vivica has recently 
prioritized philanthropic and literary initiatives. Her partnership 
with The Fractal Group has nurtured the aspirations of the next 
generation of actors and provided crucial funding to the arts. In her 
motivational memoir, ``Every Day I'm Hustling,'' Vivica expands on her 
message of positivity and drive in hopes of inspiring people to never 
give up--a message that will continue to resonate with new generations 
of young artists and leaders.
  Vivica's professional trajectory has forged a legacy of leadership, 
compassion, and inspiration. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Vivica A. Fox.

               CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT OF CINDY AUBREY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LAMBORN

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the retirement of 
Cindy Aubrey from Pikes Peak United Way after ten years of dedicated 
service to Colorado's Fifth Congressional District. The CEO role at 
PPUW has been the culmination of a lifetime of service to her hometown. 
Cindy is known for her strong work ethic, visionary leadership, and her 
loving service of others. These qualities manifest in numerous 
capacities: as a daughter, a sister, a friend, a mentor, or a 
colleague. Cindy's career and impact demonstrate the rare combination 
of utilizing her community-minded as well as an individual-focused 
approach. Cindy has exemplified putting her neighbors above herself and 
uplifting those around her in every way that she could.
  A proud Colorado native, born and raised in Colorado Springs, Cindy 
graduated from Mitchell High School. Cindy then graduated from Colorado 
State University where she was and remains a proud CSU Ram. After 
college, Cindy started her media career at Fox 21 before moving to 
KOAA, where she led the Creative Services Department and later the News 
Department. In these roles Cindy helped inform and shape our community, 
while gaining the respect of the entire community for her outstanding 
work.
  After developing a heart for the Pikes Peak region in her media 
career, Cindy continued the mission of community service by taking on 
the role of Chief Communications Officer with the City of Colorado 
Springs. It was here that she served during some of the greatest 
challenges in our region's history--the Waldo Canyon and Black Forest 
fires. Working tirelessly with first responders and other city 
officials, Cindy provided residents with vital, accurate, timely 
information, and did so with empathy and humility.
  In some ways as a culmination of her life's mission of community 
service up to this point, Cindy took on a new endeavor with Pikes Peak 
United Way, first as the Senior Vice President of Marketing, and 
eventually, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under Cindy's 
guidance Pikes Peak United Way created new initiatives and partnerships 
that expanded the organization's already extensive impact. This 
included celebrating 100 years of Pikes Peak United Way serving the 
Pikes Peak region and partnering with many other organizations to 
launch the Family Success Center, offering a broad range of services to 
empower those in need in our community.
  In addition to her leadership in the Pikes Peak region, Cindy has 
been recognized for and awarded the Colorado Springs Business Journal 
Woman of Influence award, the Public Relations Society of America Vista 
Award, the Colorado Coaches for Charity MVP award, and the Business 
Leader of the Year from the Southern Colorado Women's Chamber of 
Commerce. It is evident that Cindy's impact is broad and deep in our 
community.
  Cindy and her husband Peter are parents to Liam and his wife Tori and 
now Grammy to their beautiful granddaughter, Azaela Joy. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask that my colleagues in Congress join me in congratulating her upon 
her retirement and celebrating the life and dedicated service of a true 
champion for the Pikes Peak region, Cindy Aubrey.

    RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HONORABLE MILDRED C. CRUMP

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LaMONICA McIVER

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mrs. McIVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of the 
Honorable Mildred C. Crump, a visionary leader and trailblazer from my 
beloved city of Newark, New Jersey. Mildred was a woman of many 
``firsts'' and her wisdom, guidance, and unwavering belief in justice 
helped shape my life and career--and transformed the lives of so many 
others. As the first African American woman elected to the Newark City 
Council and as the council's first woman president, Mildred broke 
barriers and demonstrated a steadfast commitment to equity, justice, 
and community empowerment.
  Her dedication to improving the lives of others--whether through her 
pioneering work as New Jersey's first African American Braille teacher 
or her tireless advocacy for housing, education, and civil rights--has 
left an everlasting mark on our city, state, and Nation. Council 
President Crump was more than a role model. She was a relentless 
advocate and champion for people, and a brilliant community strategist. 
She blazed a path for so many and was always a source of unwavering 
support for those of us who had the honor of learning from her. 
Mildred's leadership, compassion, and vision will be profoundly missed.
  All Newarkers mourn the loss of this exceptional woman. I send my 
deepest condolences to her children, Larry and Sheri, and all her loved 
ones. I know Mildred's legacy and impact will live on. It lives on in 
me and many others.
  I thank Mildred C. Crump, on behalf of all the little Black and brown 
girls she has inspired and provided a light to shine. We love you 
forever.

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our dear late 
neighbor Mrs. Bonna Jo Tersch, and her lifetime of devotion to the 
Fifth District of Illinois' Ravenswood community. Bonna, or ``B'', was 
a native of small-town Missouri who found her passion living along the 
Chicago River with her husband and sons, planting gardens for all to 
enjoy, and promoting peace and beauty in our world.
  B co-founded the Greater Rockwell Organization in 1979 and served as 
its first Secretary--a role she carried for 44 years. B started and 
managed Greater Rockwell Organization's popular annual neighborhood-
wide yard sales, worked with fellow volunteers to report criminal 
activity, and rose at dawn to paint over graffiti. This nonprofit civic 
group was recently voted Best Block Club by the Chicago Reader.
  B also partnered with the Chicago Transit Authority to modernize, 
decorate, and clean the Rockwell El station, the cornerstone of a small 
business hub that she helped make more vibrant than ever. She secured 
grants, including awards to establish over a dozen ``corner gardens'' 
that add distinctive natural charm around the neighborhood, and to 
create the Montrose Metra Community Gardens.
  Although B preferred to humbly volunteer behind the scenes, her 
decades of public service were recognized by groups like the Ravenswood 
Community Council and Greening of Ravenswood.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives in

recognizing Mrs. Bonna Jo Tersch for her years of service to the City 
of Chicago, and her legacy of ``leaving things better than you found 
them.''

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Tigran 
Gambaryan and celebrate his return home to the United States of the 
America, and to his friends and family.
  Mr. Gambaryan is an American citizen, a resident of Georgia, and a 
dedicated former public servant. While on a business trip to Nigeria in 
February, he was arrested and charged with false accusations of tax 
evasion and money laundering. Tigran was detained in the notorious Kuje 
Prison for months, repeatedly denied access to medical care as his 
health deteriorated, denied basic due process rights, and otherwise 
treated inhumanely. Despite these severe hardships, Mr. Gambaryan 
displayed remarkable resilience and an unwavering determination to 
return home.
  Finally, on October 23, 2024, Nigeria dropped all fraudulent charges 
against Mr. Gambaryan, and he was able to return safely to the United 
States. I want to thank the hard work and dedication of the Department 
of State officials for the role they played to bring Mr. Gambaryan 
home. I also want to extend my deepest gratitude to my colleagues on 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee for their unwavering support and 
advocacy in urging the Nigerian government to secure his release. Most 
importantly, I want to commend Mr. Gambaryan for his courage and for 
never losing hope during this tumultuous situation.
  It is an honor to represent brave individuals like Tigran Gambaryan 
in Congress, and I celebrate his return home to his wife Yuki and their 
two young children. God bless their family.

my friend and colleague, Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
Cathy McMorris Rodgers, on her retirement from the House of 
Representatives after a 20-year career representing the folks of 
Washington's 5th congressional district.
  I've had the pleasure of working closely with Cathy on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee for a long time and together we've been able to 
accomplish some amazing things for the American people. I've admired 
her determination and strength to get our priorities across the finish 
line and she has never stopped working tirelessly on behalf of the 
people she was elected to serve. What I most admire about Cathy is her 
dedication to her family and the Down Syndrome community. Over the 
years I've had the privilege of becoming friends with her son Cole, who 
has inspired me and is one of the reasons I'm so passionate about 
supporting Cathy's work on behalf of the Down Syndrome community. She 
has been a tireless champion for the community and left a lasting 
legacy with her accomplishments on behalf of the people who are 
differently-abled, so they can live their lives to their full potential 
with no barriers or bias or obstacles standing in their way.
  While her colleagues will miss her dearly, we wish Cathy and her 
family all the best as she begins this next chapter of her life.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating my friend Congresswoman 
Cathy McMorris Rodgers on her retirement from the House of 
Representatives after 20 years of service to the people of Washington's

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional 
District, it is my honor to recognize Maricopa County Supervisor for 
District 4, Clint Hickman.
  Clint, a 4th-generation Arizonan, has served on the Board of 
Supervisors since March 21, 2013. He also is the Vice President of 
Sales and Marketing at Hickman's Family Farms, the largest egg producer 
in the southwest United States. Supervisor Hickman's experience running 
a business and his deep roots in the West Valley have guided his 
actions on the Board of Supervisors, leading the Counties' approach to 
fiscal responsibility and effective governance. He has been a valuable 
resource to his constituents and small businesses, and helped lead the 
county through the challenging COVID-19 pandemic.
  I sincerely appreciate Clint's service to the 8th Congressional 
District, Maricopa County, and Arizona.

           CELEBRATING THE NEW TESTAMENT TEMPLE CHURCH OF GOD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the history 
of, and the amazing work carried out by the New Testament Temple Church 
of God (NTT). A Church that has always put community and congregation 
first, even in its name. In 1976, Jamaican Immigrant, Reverend Albert 
Edwards and his family founded the church in affiliation with the 
Church of God. To honor Jamaican naming preferences New Testament was 
added into the name, and the church added temple to honor the former 
Synagogue whose space the church bought. The church was officially 
named the New Testament Temple Church of God in 2013 to reflect the 
church's rich history. In 1983, the church purchased the location on 
Seymour Ave. where it resides today.
  NTT has always carried the Lord's work across the community. 
Originally, Edwards attended a church with his family outside of the 
Bronx, but soon found the travel distance to be too long. So, Reverend 
Edwards opened his home to provide a space to for a small fellowship to 
worship. As the congregation grew, so too did the services provided. 
Since becoming Senior Pastor in 1994, Bishop Paul Peart helped the 
church establish a non-profit called the Good Neighbors Community 
Outreach Agency (est. 2002). The organization provides so many social 
services within the church and to the broader community. Services have 
included GED courses, computer access, preschool, after school, housing 
assistance, food assistance, clothing provision, and a host of other 
critical community services.
  NTT played a key role in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and the community will be forever thankful for that. The church was 
deemed an essential organization and provided food pantry services to 
families. During the pandemic NTT went from assisting 200 families per 
week to over 2,000 families per week. Without their services many 
individuals would have been without food, NTT also partnered with 
United Way of NYC to provide other essential supplies to the community 
during the pandemic.
  Currently NTT is responding to increased migration by hosting up to 
120 asylum seekers per week. Giving them access to kitchen and dining 
facilities, as well as clothing and other necessities. Importantly NTT 
provides asylum seekers with local community connections.
  I thank the New Testament Temple Church of God and reiterate their 
motto. G.R.O.W.T.H.S Through Joyful Service. G--Glorifying God, R--
Religious Life, O--Outreach Evangelism, W--World Missions, T--Training 
of Disciples, H--Hospitality, S--Supportive Ministries. I look forward 
to hearing about NTT's continued community leadership.

Organized for Public Service/Metro Alliance. Since 1974, the COPS/Metro 
Alliance has invested billions of dollars into San Antonio families and 
have fought to make the City a place where everyone's voices are heard.
  Led by a West-Side native organizer named Ernesto Cortes Jr., church 
leaders across the City began to organize and work with one another to 
secure more opportunities for working class residents. They used their 
newfound voices to fight for housing for seniors, environmental 
protections, and safer streets. Members of COPS/Metro Alliance even 
began running for office, and successfully secured funding for 
libraries, parks, and public services.

[[Page E1252]]

  When factories and plants closed in San Antonio, they created job-
training programs and worked with businesses to bring more high-paying 
jobs to the City. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the COPS/
Metro Alliance founded an unprecedented education and job placement 
program called ``SA Ready to Work'', offering over 28,000 San Antonio 
residents job placement, support, and retention services, and tuition 
for high school equivalency, college degrees, and industry-recognized 
certifications: the first of its kind in the Nation.
  While great strides have been made in the last few decades to make 
San Antonio a more equitable city, there is still more work to be done. 
As the Representative for Texas's 35th Congressional District, I know 
that the COPS/Metro Alliance will continue its incredible legacy of 
uplifting the most disadvantaged among us, and work to create an even 
greater San Antonio.

                    CELEBRATING DETECTIVE EDWIN HUGH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. NICK LaLOTA

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. LaLOTA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate Detective Edwin 
Hugh of the Suffolk County Police Department, who has been honored with 
the 7th Annual U.S. Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service 
in Community Policing. This prestigious recognition highlights 
Detective Hugh's outstanding contributions to community safety and his 
unwavering commitment to making Suffolk County a better place to live. 
His achievements exemplify the core values of law enforcement: 
integrity, dedication, and an unrelenting drive to protect and serve.
  Detective Hugh has proven himself to be a leader in law enforcement, 
building trust with residents and strengthening public safety across 
Suffolk County. Whether pursuing justice for victims of crime or 
engaging directly with the community to foster partnerships, Detective 
Hugh consistently goes above and beyond the call of duty. Suffolk 
County is a safer place because of Detective Hugh's hard work and 
steadfast dedication to better our communities.
  His efforts to combat crime, reduce harm, and improve the lives of 
residents reflect his dedication not only to the badge he wears but 
also to the people he serves. He understands that effective policing is 
not just about enforcing laws--it is about creating an environment 
where families feel secure, businesses can thrive, and communities can 
flourish.
  On behalf of the people of Suffolk County and the 1st Congressional 
District of New York, I extend my sincere congratulations to Detective 
Edwin Hugh and my heartfelt gratitude for his exceptional service. His 
work serves as a model for law enforcement professionals across the 
country, and his contributions to Suffolk County are a source of pride 
for us all.

                          ____________________

  RECOGNIZING MY SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF DIRECTOR, SOPHIE MIRVISS, FOR HER 
  EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr.  PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Staff 
Director, Sophie Mirviss, for her work on behalf of every constituent 
in Minnesota's Third Congressional District. In October, Sophie 
departed my office for a new opportunity to serve as the Chief of Staff 
to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East and I 
could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
  Sophie's journey as a public servant began just after she graduated 
from Johns Hopkins University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in 
international studies and a minor in economics. Though she was 
initialjy hired as my scheduler, her expertise in foreign policy led 
her to become my National Security Legislative Assistant. Soon after, 
she joined the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East. 
North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism in which she served under 
Reps, Ted Deutch (FL-22) and David Cicilline (RI-0 1). In this time, 
she worked her way up from Professional Staff Member to the 
Subcommittee Staff Director all the while pursuing a master's degree in 
defense and strategic studies at the U.S. Naval War College. As a 
Minnesota District Three native. Sophie understands how diplomacy and 
conflicts in far-away lands can impact our own communities, which has 
made her a wonderful advocate for our constituents in the foreign 
policy sphere.
  Sophie is a powerhouse. She is not only a master knitter, but also an 
embodiment of what every congressional staffer strives to be. Confident 
in her abilities and fearless in her pursuit of peace through better 
policy, she brings a fire and intensity to her work that inspires 
everyone to be the best version of themselves. Sophie is just the type 
of person you would want with you in the case of a zombie apocalypse--
she is smart, determined, loyal, and a joy to be around. For that, 
we've been extremely grateful to have her on our team.
  The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. 
However, I'm extraordinarily happy that she will continue to do this 
work and serve the Nation. I wish Sophie all the best in her future 
endeavors and thank her for six years of faithful service to this 
Nation.

RECOGNIZING CHRISTIAN COUNTY, MISSOURI, TREASURER KAREN MATTHEWS ON HER 
                               RETIREMENT

                                 ______

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Karen Matthews, 
the Christian County, Missouri, Treasurer, on her retirement. Christian 
County is home to nearly 90,000 citizens in the southwest part of 
Missouri, and Ms. Matthews has served as an elected official there for 
22 years.
  During her tenure, Ms. Matthews has achieved many accomplishments. 
She manages nearly $50 million annually in county revenue and 
transitioned the county's operations from a third-class county to a 
first-class county due to the area's population growth. She initiated 
online banking for the county, direct deposit payroll for county 
employees and implemented premier financial software. She also saved 
the county thousands of dollars by implementing a more efficient time 
and attendance software. Finally, despite the millions of annual 
transactions, the county has successfully passed all of its dozens of 
audits with 100-percent compliance.
  Ms. Matthews was honored by her peers by being elected as the 
treasurer for the Missouri County Treasurer's Association, a position 
she has held since 2012. She also is the treasurer for Mt. Zion Baptist 
Church, serves on the Missouri County Treasurer's Association 
legislative board and is a member of several area chambers of commerce. 
In addition to her public service, she has been the co-owner of several 
small businesses in the construction and home design fields.
  I'd like to congratulate Ms. Matthews on her well-deserved 
retirement. She has faithfully executed her responsilities as county 
treasurer and she will be missed. I wish her the very best in the next 
phase of her life.

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Moniquec Conner 
as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.
  Moniquec is a trailblazing civil rights activist. She was recently 
recognized with a Humanitarian Stone Award from the National Action 
Network, an organization dedicated to advancing civil rights issues.
  This award reflects the years of hard work, dedication, and 
perseverance that she has invested in our community and fighting for 
the advancement of civil rights. Her commitment has remained 
steadfast--the hallmark of concerned and responsible citizenship.
  Moniquec is currently the chair of the Ohio Women in the NAACP, and 
in 1999, she revitalized the Stark County branch of the NAACP, serving 
as its president in 2000.
  In addition to her work for the NAACP, she is also the interim 
president of the National Action Network chapter that serves Stark and 
Summit counties.
  As she has throughout her remarkable career, Moniquec continues to 
focus on issues such as police accountability, voting rights, corporate 
responsibility, pension diversity, youth leadership, crisis intake, 
victim assistance, and bridging the digital divide.
  I would like to thank Moniquec for her dedication to fighting for 
change, and the amazing

[[Page E1253]]

work she does on behalf of the community. As a woman in a position of 
influence, she has certainly inspired the next generation of leaders to 
stand strong in their convictions and fight for justice.
  Moniquec's unwavering championing of civil rights exemplifies the 
very spirit that makes Ohio's 13th Congressional District the 
``Birthplace of Champions.'' With this national recognition, she has 
certainly made our community proud.

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my friend, Russell 
D. Smoldon, CEO of B3 Strategies.
  I first met Russell while serving in the Arizona State Legislature in 
2009. At the time, Russell was the manager of government relations for 
Salt River Project (SRP), a major utility and water company in Arizona.
  Russell now runs his own company and has over 35 years of public 
policy experience focused on energy, water, environmental, taxation, 
healthcare, and economic development issues.
  Russell is a respected leader in Arizona and I believe just about 
everyone knows him and likes him. He serves on the board of the Arizona 
Tax Research Association (ATRA) and on the board of CrossRoads. Russell 
has also served in leadership positions with the Western Business 
Roundtable, the Greater Phoenix Urban League, the American Legislative 
Exchange Council (ALEC), the National Conference of State Legislators' 
Advisory Council on Energy, and the National Tax Partnership. He also 
served as a member of the Arizona Supreme Court's Child Support 
Guidelines and Domestic Relations Committees and the Arizona Highway 
Users' Association, and has assisted numerous non-profit organizations, 
including the Arizona Trails Association.
  Russell is caring, fun-loving, funny, and knowledgeable. I have 
called on him for input on Arizona issues for many years.
  I thank Russell for his years of support and for all of the times he 
has provided me with valuable information and advice. Please know that 
I appreciate him. May God continue to Bless him and his family for 
years to come.

 RECOGNIZING BRYAN MacDONALD AND HIS DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE CITY OF 
                           OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 10, 2024

  Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Bryan MacDonald, 
Mayor Pro Tem of the City of Oxnard, a notable public servant whose 
unwavering dedication has left an indelible mark on our community.
  Bryan's service to Oxnard began in 2008 when he was first elected to 
the City Council, and his leadership and commitment to public service 
have been steadfast throughout his tenure. He was re-elected in 2012, 
2016, and 2020, demonstrating his ongoing dedication to the city's 
growth and prosperity. In 2020, Bryan was appointed Mayor Pro Tem, a 
role that has allowed him to further influence the city's progress and 
address the needs of its residents. Prior to his time in local 
government, Bryan served for 30 years in the Oxnard Police Department, 
retiring as Assistant Chief of Police. His leadership in law 
enforcement has been a pillar of the city's public safety efforts and 
continues to serve as a lasting testament to his dedication and 
commitment to our community.
  Beyond his roles in law enforcement and city governance, Bryan 
continues to share his wealth of knowledge as an Adjunct Professor of 
Criminal Justice at Ventura College. His influence extends well beyond 
the classroom, as he has taken on leadership positions with 
organizations that impact the entire community. Bryan has served as the 
Chairperson for the American Cancer Society Gold Coast Community 
Council, Board President of the Elite Theatre Company, and is an active 
member of the Alcohol and Drug Advisory Board for the County of Ventura 
Behavioral Health Department. He is also deeply involved with the 
Knights of Columbus, Council 750, and has contributed countless hours 
to making Oxnard a better place for all.
  A long-time resident of Oxnard, Bryan and his wife Lorraine have 
called this community home since 1985. Together, they have been a 
constant presence in our city, investing in its people, its future, and 
its wellbeing.
  As Bryan steps down from his role on the City Council, I join our 
community in expressing our appreciation for his immense contributions 
to public safety, education, and the overall commitment to building a 
better and stronger Oxnard. From his distinguished career in law 
enforcement to his leadership in governance and his community 
involvement, Bryan MacDonald has served our community well.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with great esteem and respect that I recognize 
Bryan MacDonald for his invaluable service to the City of Oxnard. I 
thank him for his many years of leadership and commitment, and I wish 
him continued success in the next chapter of his life's journey.

        CONGRATULATING CONGRESSIONAL WRITING COMPETITION WINNERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
winners of our first ever congressional writing competition. I asked 
students from around Iowa's First Congressional District, elementary, 
middle, and high school, to submit an essay about what makes Iowa 
special. Given that the University of Iowa has the Writers' Workshop, 
writing in Iowa is a known quantity.
  I was moved by the quality of writing our students in Iowa possess 
and their unwavering love for Iowa.
  The winners are: Katelyn Cope, sixth grader from Newton; Adele 
Decker, sixth grader from Newton; Sawyer Rhoades, sixth grader from 
Keokuk; Georgia Clark, eighth grader from West Liberty; Gwenavier 
Spalding, ninth grader from Anamosa; Kayden Wherry, ninth grader from 
Anamosa; Yuchen Gong, 11th grader from Iowa City; and Justin Chapman, 
12th grader from Williamsburg.
  The winners will receive a certificate of achievement as well as a 
flag flown over the Capitol building.
  I congratulate these dedicated students. I look forward to seeing all 
of their contributions to Iowa in the future.


             Congratulating the Iowa Hawkeyes Football Team

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Iowa 
Hawkeyes football team on another winning season. Led by the breakout 
running back Kaleb Johnson, who finished the regular season with 1,537 
yards and 21 touchdowns, the Hawkeyes finished 8-4, with key wins 
coming against Washington, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
  This season was a historical one for our longtime coach, Kirk 
Ferentz. Coach Ferentz clinched his 204th career win on November 29 and 
is now only one win away from the all-time record for wins in the Big 
10.
  While the regular season may be over, there is still more football to 
be played. On December 30, the Iowa Hawkeyes will be taking on the 
number 19 in the country, the Missouri Tigers, in the Music City Bowl 
in Nashville.
  I once again congratulate the Hawkeyes on a great season and wish 
them all the best in their bowl game.
  Go Hawks.


                    Giving Veterans Tools to Thrive

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Veterans SPORT Act, legislation I introduced to ensure that our 
Nation's veterans have access to adaptive prostheses and terminal 
devices for sports and recreational activities as part of their medical 
benefits.
  Currently, veterans eligible for VA medical services can receive 
artificial limbs, but those wishing to engage in sports and recreation 
lack access to specialized equipment. This bill amends title 38 of the 
United States Code to include these critical devices, allowing veterans 
to pursue activities that support their physical and mental well-being.
  Sports and recreation are vital components to rehabilitation, 
promoting fitness, social interaction, a sense of accomplishment, and 
the sense of being a whole person once again.
  The Veterans SPORT Act empowers veterans to regain independence and 
participate fully in activities they love. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill and ensure our veterans have the tools they need to 
thrive.


                         Misguided EV Mandates

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
President Trump's commitment to ending the misguided EV mandates set by 
the Biden-Harris administration.
  While our country and our automakers need to make EVs to combat the 
Chinese Communist Party and electric vehicles have their place in the 
market, the American people should not be forced into adopting them.
  Hundreds of millions of Americans rely on combustion engine vehicles 
in their daily lives, and these mandates are driving up the cost for 
families who can least afford it.
  In just 2 years, the Biden administration allocated $7.5 billion in 
taxpayer funds for EV chargers, yet only eight

[[Page H6540]]

stations have been completed. This failure highlights the need for a 
more thoughtful approach, one that assesses cost and benefit and one 
that respects consumer choice and avoids unnecessary government 
intervention.
  President Trump understands that a thriving economy is built on 
freedom and choice, not top-down mandates. Under his leadership, the 
American people will have the freedom to make their own decisions 
without the overreach of Washington.


                   Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year

  Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, Merriam-Webster has named 
``polarization'' the word of year. While that may reflect current 
times, it should also serve as a reminder that we must work harder to 
bridge the growing divide in our Nation.

  Too often, political discourse has become hostile, with one side 
labeling their opponents as extremists for advocating commonsense 
solutions like securing our borders, lowering costs, or commonsense 
solutions that are helping hardworking families and ensuring fairness 
in women's sports.
  I am optimistic that we can begin to heal these divisions and put 
America back on track. We must come together to prioritize policies 
that promote economic growth, strengthen national security, and restore 
the American Dream.
  As we move into a new year, let us focus on the values that unite us 
and work for the betterment of all Americans.

    WITH GRATITUDE TO NORTH CAROLINA'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Manning) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep gratitude for the 
people of North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District for trusting me 
to represent them in the U.S. House of Representatives.
  I have been proud to stand with House Democrats to pass historic 
legislation to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, lower the cost of 
prescription drugs, strengthen domestic manufacturing, protect our 
future with the development of clean energy, address gun violence, and 
provide vital support for our veterans.
  Thanks to these efforts, 80,000 households in my district have gained 
access to affordable high-speed internet, 39,000 residents are saving 
hundreds of dollars annually on their prescription drugs, and more than 
4,700 veterans exposed to toxins during their service have filed claims 
to access benefits they have earned.
  I have also been proud to secure nearly $60 million in Federal 
funding for community projects across the Sixth District. From improved 
transportation to new equipment for our police and firefighters, public 
safety initiatives, expanding education and job training, incentivizing 
economic development and public health, these projects are making a 
real difference.
  I have also been proud to fight against the terrible loss of women's 
rights. Two years ago, the Supreme Court overturned 50 years of 
judicial precedent with its decision to strike down Roe v. Wade. This 
terrible ruling stripped millions of women of their right to obtain an 
abortion, has placed devastating hurdles in obtaining care for 
miscarriages, and has unleashed a wave of rightwing attacks on the full 
range of women's reproductive healthcare, including birth control.
  That is why I introduced my Right to Contraception Act, to protect 
access to all FDA-approved birth control, which passed through the 
House in the last Congress. Sadly, my bill was blocked by Republicans, 
first in the Senate and again this term by Republicans in the House. It 
is shameful.
  As policy co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I have been 
proud to fight for all women to make decisions about their own bodies 
and to have the ability to succeed in the workplace while still caring 
for their children and their family members.
  In addition to fighting for North Carolinians' basic freedoms, I have 
worked to advance America's values and interests on the world stage. As 
the vice ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have 
advocated for rebuilding and expanding strong relationships with our 
allies, including unwavering support for Ukraine and Israel in the face 
of unprecedented attacks.
  After Hamas' brutal October 7 invasion of Israel, I have stood up 
against the alarming rise in anti-Semitism here at home and around the 
globe as the co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating 
Antisemitism. This includes introducing my Countering Antisemitism Act, 
the most comprehensive legislation aimed at addressing the disturbing 
increase in anti-Semitism in our country's history.
  This bill must be passed if we are serious about eradicating the 
scourge of the world's oldest hatred and protecting the fundamentals of 
our democracy. What begins with hatred against the Jews never ends 
there but spreads to other vulnerable groups.
  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I have 
championed investments in our students and schools and worked to 
address the youth mental health crisis, introducing the Improving 
Mental Health and Wellness in Schools Act to expand resources for our 
students.
  As chair of the New Democrat Coalition Workforce Development Task 
Force, I have fought to address ongoing labor shortages and prepare 
workers for the jobs of the future.
  While I would love to continue this important work on behalf of my 
constituents, the blatantly gerrymandered congressional districts 
passed by the Republican-led North Carolina General Assembly make it 
impossible for me to do so. These maps are a deliberate distortion of 
the will of the people, designed with surgical precision to split 
communities of interest and deny real representation to North 
Carolinians. These maps force me to depart Congress, but I recognize 
that I am doing so at a time of great division within our country.
  Now, more than ever, it is our duty in this Chamber to reaffirm the 
fundamental values that unite us as Americans: freedom, democracy, the 
rule of law, and the belief that all people are created equal.
  While I will not be here to witness the next chapters of history 
written in this Chamber, I will keep using my voice to defend these 
values and trust in their enduring power to make our Union more 
perfect.
  I will close by thanking my extraordinary staff members who work 
every day to get things done for the people we represent. I thank 
everyone who supported me in getting to Congress and all the colleagues 
with whom I have worked to develop friendships on both sides of the 
aisle.

           RECOGNIZING FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND OTHER PRODUCERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize our 
Nation's hardworking and dedicated farmers, ranchers, and other 
producers.
  In 1978, radio broadcaster Paul Harvey addressed the Future Farmers 
of America at their annual convention and delivered a powerful message 
that highlighted the importance of our Nation's farmers.
  He said:

     And on the 8th day, God looked down on his planned paradise 
           and said: I need a caretaker.
     So God made a farmer.
     God said: I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk 
           cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat 
           supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a 
           meeting of the school board.
     So God made a farmer.
     God said: I need somebody with arms strong enough to rustle a 
           calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own 
           grandchild; somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous 
           machinery, come home hungry, have to wait lunch until 
           his wife is done feeding visiting ladies, then tell the 
           ladies to be sure and come back real soon and mean it.
     So God made a farmer.
     God said: I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a 
           newborn colt and watch it die, then dry his eyes and 
           say: Maybe next year. I need somebody who can shape an 
           ax handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a 
           hunk of car tire, who can make a harness out of 
           haywire, feed sacks, and shoe scraps; who, planting 
           time and

[[Page H6541]]

           harvest season, will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday 
           noon and then painin' from tractor back, put in another 
           72 hours.
     So God made a farmer.
     God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double 
           speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and 
           yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the 
           first smoke from a neighbor's place.
     So God made a farmer.
     God said: I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and 
           heave bales, yet gentle enough to tame lambs and wean 
           pigs and tend the pink-combed pullets, who will stop 
           his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a 
           meadow lark.
     It had to be somebody who would plow deep and straight and 
           not cut corners; somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, 
           and rake and disc and plow and plant, and tie the 
           fleece and strain the milk and replenish the self-
           feeders and finish the hard week's work with a 5-mile 
           drive to church; somebody who would bale a family 
           together with the soft, strong bonds of sharing, who 
           would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply, with 
           smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend 
           his life ``doing what dad does.''
     So God made a farmer.

                              {time}  1015

  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, it is 
my honor to advocate for their interests and ensure that they have 
certainty and stability for generations to come.
  Even though Paul Harvey wrote these remarks about our Nation's 
farmers, it encompasses so much more than that. Our farmers, ranchers, 
foresters, and producers are essential in providing food, fiber, and 
fuel to our Nation and the world.
  Mr. Speaker, food security is national security. As we head into the 
holiday season, I recognize and thank our Nation's producers for their 
contributions to our everyday lives.

                          ____________________

     HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HOUSTON'S IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. Lee Carter) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the rich legacy 
of Houston's immigrant communities and the contributions they have made 
to improve the lives of all Houstonians and the United States of 
America.
  Houston is a city built by Dreamers, a vibrant metropolis where 
nearly one-quarter of our population is comprised of immigrants.
  I will highlight members of Houston's immigrant community who are as 
diverse as they are inspiring.
  From Eugene Pillot, who opened one of the city's first opera houses, 
to Ninfa Laurenzo, whose modest restaurant blossomed into a 
multimillion-dollar empire featuring Tex-Mex classics.
  In these times when some would demonize immigrants, who have always 
been an important part of America's fabric, I choose to lift them up.
  In Houston, foreign-born Latinos make up 20 percent of our population 
and include persons like Renaissance man Felix Tijerina, a 
restaurateur, philanthropist, and the 25th president of the League of 
United Latin American Citizens; Ellen Ochoa, the first Latina in space 
and a former director at the Johnson Space Center which is in the 
Houston area. They remind me of the limitless potential immigrants 
bring to our society.
  Houston is also home to the Nation's largest Nigerian population 
outside of Nigeria. Nearly 57,000 Nigerian Americans call Houston home.
  The legendary athlete Hakeem Olajuwon is a proud Nigerian American. 
He dominated at the University of Houston and became the number one 
draft pick in 1984 where he played for the Houston Rockets and led us 
to a pair of championships. I was proud to be at those games to cheer 
him on.
  Immigrant contributions go beyond culture and commerce. Immigrants 
are vital to Houston's economy, especially in industries like 
healthcare, education, and construction.
  Our educational institutions have also prospered from immigrant 
leadership like Dr. Renu Khator, an immigrant from India and the 
chancellor of the University of Houston. She was the first Indian 
immigrant to head a comprehensive research institution in the United 
States. She has raised a record number of research dollars and overseen 
unprecedented growth. Her story remains a testament to the 
transformative power of immigration, education, and innovation.
  Yet, challenges still persist. Around 67,000 college-educated 
immigrants in Houston are underemployed and not living to their full 
potential, which is sometimes called brain waste. We must address this 
by reducing licensing barriers and improving English proficiency 
programs. We must create real immigration reform, as that solidifies 
pathways to citizenship and reduces the backlog.
  Also, nearly one-half of all children in Houston live in a household 
where at least one parent immigrated to the United States, and these 
parents are shaping the next generation of Houstonians who will be 
leaders, innovators, and changemakers.
  However, they face extreme challenges, specifically those with 
temporary or undocumented status. Barriers to naturalization and access 
to public services create uncertainty for many, despite their immense 
contributions to our city.
  In my home State of Texas, State leadership is fighting to keep DACA 
recipients, our Dreamers, from being able to pay for Affordable Care 
Act insurance under the Biden rule. They should not deny access to 
those brought here as children to healthcare and health insurance.

  Houston's immigrant communities are not just part of our city, they 
are a key part of what has made our city and Nation truly great. Let us 
honor their contributions, celebrate their achievements, and continue 
to build a city and a nation where everyone, regardless of origin, has 
the opportunity to thrive.

                          ____________________

                  RECONCILIATION CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, our country is in dire fiscal straits. 
Years of profligacy under both parties are now crushing our economy 
under the heaviest debt in our long history. Just paying the interest 
on that debt now exceeds what we spend on our Nation's entire defense. 
History warns us that nations that bankrupt themselves aren't around 
very long.
  Now many people find hope in President Trump's creation of an 
unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Others propose 
a bipartisan fiscal commission.
  However, in our haste to pass the buck, let us all remember that it 
is Congress alone that holds the purse strings. Try as we may, we 
cannot escape our responsibility. Congress is the ultimate bipartisan 
fiscal commission because, in a very real sense, the buck starts here. 
The Federal Government cannot raise or spend a single dollar unless and 
until the House says that it can. Ultimately, this responsibility rests 
with us. It cannot be DOGE'd and it cannot be dodged.
  Fortunately, we have the ideal tools in our possession to bring 
spending in line with revenues if we choose to use them properly: the 
budget resolution and the accompanying reconciliation act.
  Here is how it works. Both Houses agree on a spending ceiling by a 
simple majority resolution. Reconciliation instructions are then sent 
to every House committee with the mandate to report out statutory 
changes to bring spending within these limits. If they fail to act, 
then the House Budget Committee acts in their place, and a single 
comprehensive bill goes to the floor for an up-or-down vote. The bill 
gets expedited consideration in the Senate, and when signed by the 
President, all the laws necessary to balance the budget are enacted 
together.
  There is one catch. It can only be used to enact the fiscal reforms 
necessary to implement the budget. It cannot be used for general 
policymaking beyond these fiscal confines.
  The last time this process was used as it was designed and intended 
was during the Republican majority led by Newt Gingrich in 1995. The 
result was four balanced budgets in a row that produced one of the 
greatest waves of prosperity our Nation as has ever seen.
  Tragically, in 2017, the Republican majority under Paul Ryan utterly

[[Page H6542]]

squandered this authority. Instead of using the reconciliation process 
to bring mandatory spending to heel, it was abused to achieve pet 
political projects, first repealing ObamaCare and next for tax cuts.
  The first attempt resulted in a mangled mess of incomplete fiscal 
measures that collapsed in the Senate. The next budget year, the object 
was tax reform, but since it had to fall within the narrow fiscal 
parameters of reconciliation, most of the tax cuts could only be 
temporary and will soon expire. The result was no healthcare reform and 
only temporary tax relief.
  The opportunity cost was to squander our last chance to prevent the 
fiscal debacle that our country now faces.
  Last month, the American people gave Republicans a rare second chance 
to save our country from insolvency. We must not repeat the mistakes 
that have brought us here. Republican leaders in the House and Senate 
are, once again, proposing to use the budget and reconciliation process 
not as it was designed, to set spending limits and adhere to those 
limits, but rather to chase a variety of shiny objects including tax 
reform, energy development, and border security.
  These are all vital reforms, and they need to be enacted. Indeed, 
some aspects of them can be realized as a byproduct of the 
reconciliation process. However, that process cannot produce 
comprehensive policy reform. It can produce comprehensive fiscal reform 
at a moment when our Nation faces its greatest fiscal threat in its 
history.
  I appeal to the Speaker to follow the success of the Gingrich 
majority. If we repeat the mistakes of the past, then we will lose the 
future. We are on the threshold of a sovereign debt crisis the likes of 
which this Nation has never seen and that few nations have ever 
survived. Let us not throw away this, the last fleeting chance to avert 
fiscal disaster.
  The American people didn't save our country last month. They gave us 
the tools and the trust to save our country. Let us use the tools that 
they have given us, and let us be worthy of the trust that they have 
placed in us.

                HONORING REPRESENTATIVE EARL BLUMENAUER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Womack) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge 
the last speaker, my friend, Earl Blumenauer.
  It was a source of pride for me to be here on the floor this morning 
and see the gentleman's last speech on the floor of the House of 
Representatives. Though we may disagree on policy, and we have many 
times, I count the gentleman as a dear friend and colleague. It has 
been a great honor to serve with my colleague Earl, and this place is 
going to miss him.
  The gentleman has made me a better Congressman, and he has made me a 
better person. I congratulate the gentleman and wish him the best.


                 Congratulating the Greenwood Bulldogs

  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Arkansas' 6A State 
football champions, the Greenwood Bulldogs, after a convincing 61-35 
victory over Shiloh Christian Saturday at Little Rock's War Memorial 
Stadium.
  The Bulldogs went back to back in winning their 12th overall State 
title. I commend Head Coach Chris Young and his staff and players for 
another thrilling chapter in Greenwood football with this perfect and 
magical 13-0 season.
  Mr. Speaker, this title is not without tragedy. Earlier in the 
season, a house fire took the life of one of Greenwood's finest 
athletes, 18-year-old Isaiah ``Ike'' Arrington; his 46-year-old mother, 
Wendy Medrano; and his 5-year-old sister, Vivian.
  This season was dedicated to the memory of Ike and his family. The 
motivation to make this a season to remember helped Greenwood not only 
bring home the trophy but record its 70th consecutive home win in the 
process.
  I congratulate Greenwood. Their Bulldog pride is showing today, and 
they have made all of us Arkansas Proud.

                          FAREWELL TO CONGRESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor for the last time I 
will address this Chamber after 28 years in Congress.
  My goal as a Member of Congress was to leave this place a little 
better than I found it, and I am proud of what we have done. There are 
things that you are not going to see on FOX or MSNBC News, Mr. Speaker, 
and it is not going to rocket around the internet, but they are simple, 
commonsense efforts to bring people together to solve problems.
  At the beginning of each Congress for the last dozen years, I have 
given each new Member, hand-delivered, my thoughts about what they need 
to know to be able to navigate these strange waters in Congress.
  Together, we have been able to achieve some interesting things, as I 
say, items you don't see in the news necessarily, Mr. Speaker, but that 
have made a huge difference.
  I am proud of the work we have done with international water and 
sanitation that has resulted in millions of people having their lives 
saved and reducing the burdens on 140 million women who struggle to get 
water, often dirty water, for their families every day.
  I am proud of the work I have done in terms of agriculture reform 
because it is past time that we stop subsidizing a diet that makes 
Americans sick.
  I am proud of the work we did in the midst of the pandemic to create 
the Restaurant Rescue Plan: 100,000 grants that have resulted in many 
independent restaurants that were able to stay in business.
  I am proud of the work we have done with transportation and 
infrastructure to rebuild and renew America. Instead of having 
infrastructure week be a joke, we are actually doing it.
  I am proud of the work that I have done, for example, in terms of 
bicycling, symbolized by the bike lanes in the middle of Pennsylvania 
Avenue, making it easier for people to burn calories instead of fossil 
fuel and transform the face of our communities.
  I am proud of the work that we have done dealing in terms of saving 
the lives of Iraqis and Afghans who put their trust in us when they 
were helping our people in those troubled countries. You don't have to 
believe in the wars, Mr. Speaker, I didn't, but I worked to make sure 
that the men and women who were the drivers, the guides, and the 
interpreters were not left to the tender mercies of al-Qaida and the 
Taliban.
  Together we were able, with Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, to 
pass a Special Immigrant Visa that has resulted in thousands of these 
people who worked with us to be able to live and, in many cases, to be 
able to seek safety in the United States.
  As I say, these are not things that people necessarily see in the 
news or on the internet. They are not going to raise campaign money for 
their goals using them, but they are the things that make the 
difference.
  I guess my last piece of advice that I leave to the people who are 
coming in the next Congress is to focus on things that bring people 
together rather than divide them and to look for ways to solve problems 
rather than to create new ones.
  Over the course of the last 28 years, I have seen this formula work, 
and I hope in the new Congress people will employ it in ways that will 
make a difference.
  Heaven knows we need to do it.

                          ____________________

                CELEBRATING ALBANY PARK THEATER PROJECT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Albany Park 
Theater Project, a gem of Illinois' Third Congressional District, and 
to recognize their production of ``Port of Entry,'' which reminds us 
all of an important lesson.
  The story of our Nation wouldn't be complete without the sweat, 
without the tears, without the joy, and without the dreams and hopes of 
so many immigrants and children of immigrants.

[[Page H6543]]

They are the same stories that brought so many of us here to Congress.
  Located in the heart of Albany Park, one of the most diverse 
immigrant communities in the Nation, the Albany Park Theater Project 
has long been a beacon of creativity, resilience, and hope. Through the 
power of storytelling and theater, this organization prepares and 
propels young people in Illinois' Third Congressional District to lead 
civically engaged and choice-filled lives.
  Together, their team ensemble members and adult artists make world-
class, award-winning, original theater that amplifies and illuminates 
the voices of immigrants and refugees, showcasing their struggles, 
triumphs, pain, and enduring humanity.
  My husband, Boris, and I were fortunate to experience the production 
of ``Port of Entry'' together, and it was more than a performance. It 
was a profound journey in the daily lives of immigrant families from 
all over the world living in Albany Park.
  As a ``proud,'' ``orgulloso,'' daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, I 
know firsthand how important it is for immigrant stories to be told 
authentically and celebrated unapologetically.
  ``Port of Entry,'' a collaboration with Third Rail Projects, takes 
audiences into a theater production set in a typical Chicago apartment 
building.
  Audience members of ``Port of Entry'' are part of an immersive 
experience of the intimate lives of neighbors from Mexico, the 
Philippines, Russia, and beyond. Audience members share in the lived 
experiences and stories of immigrant families, celebrating their 
resilience, amplifying their voices, and showcasing the invaluable 
contributions they make to our communities.
  The cast is made up of talented young people from our community who 
brilliantly invite us to reflect on what it means to call a place home 
and what it means to find belonging and to build a future in the face 
of challenge.
  It invites us to wonder what makes the United States of America. The 
production is a culmination of years of work involving over 300 
collaborators, including youth performers, storytellers, and creators. 
It is a testament to the theater company's 27-year-old commitment to 
using the arts to empower young people in bringing our community 
together.
  Albany Park and our Nation have always been a port of entry for many 
families seeking new beginnings, whether through the southern border, 
like my mom, or welcomed by the ``Mother of Exiles,'' the Statue of 
Liberty, like many of the ancestors of the Members of this very same 
body.
  Today, at a time when Members of this Chamber and the incoming 
administration are threatening to tear our communities apart and would 
question who gets to be American and who doesn't, this play feels so 
timely and vital.
  I thank the Albany Park Theater Project and Debbie Reznick, one of 
the founding directors, for reminding us of the power of storytelling 
to inspire empathy and connection. I thank them for showing us that 
theater is not just for entertainment, but it is a vehicle for change 
and a celebration of the human spirit.

  I am so proud to represent this community. I am even prouder to be 
the daughter of immigrants. Their work reflects the very best of our 
district and our Nation.

       CELEBRATING RETIREMENT OF DENVER METEOROLOGIST MIKE NELSON

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Sorensen) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, as the only meteorologist in Congress, I 
rise today to honor one of the best in the career field of atmospheric 
science, Mike Nelson of Denver's Channel 7, on a remarkable 40-year 
career.
  For decades, Mike was the trusted voice that families turned to in 
order to prepare them for what is ahead. Blizzards, tornadoes, 
devastating wildfires, Mike tracked them all.
  His impact did not stop there. Early on, Mike took the initiative to 
communicate how our climate was changing. In addition to those watching 
his broadcasts, more than a million school-age students learned from 
him.
  A 20-time Emmy Award winner, a member of the Emmys Silver Circle, and 
a fellow of the American Meteorological Society, Mike's contributions 
are extraordinary. With many thanks, he signs off from Denver7 News 
this week.
  From Capitol Hill, I am forecasting a sunny and well-deserved 
retirement ahead. I congratulate Mike on a job well done.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Caraveo).
  Ms. CARAVEO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable career and 
contributions of Denver7 Chief Meteorologist Mike Nelson, who will 
deliver his final weather forecast this week.
  With 40 years of forecasting and 25 of those dedicated to Colorado, 
Mike Nelson has become a familiar face and trusted voice for weather in 
our State, and his impact goes far beyond the screen. From his early 
days at Weather Central to pioneering the use of computer weather 
graphics, Mike has been a trailblazer in his field.
  Over his career, Mike has shared his love of weather with more than 
750,000 students across the State, inspiring young minds with his 
trademark tornado dance. Mike's decades of dedication, innovation, and 
community service have made Colorado a better place.
  I congratulate Mike on his well-deserved retirement. Here is to clear 
skies and sunny days ahead.
  Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, finally, a last word of advice for our 
friend, Mike Nelson. On his last broadcast day, when his executive 
producer gets into his ear and says he has gone over in time, he should 
finish his work and then say: I yield back.

       HONORING RETIRING STAFF MEMBERS WADE BALLOU AND RALPH SEEP

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to honor two men who 
have given a combined 74 years of service to the House of 
Representatives, Wade Ballou and Ralph Seep. Both of these gentlemen 
are retiring and have made important contributions in the way that the 
House functions.
  In November, Wade Ballou retired after 41 years of service in the 
Office of Legislative Counsel, including the past years as head of OLC. 
Over his years, he provided clear, coherent, and high-quality legal 
analysis and built a reputation for being warm, engaging, and attentive 
to the needs of Members of Congress and staff.
  No matter how complicated or time-sensitive the project was, Wade was 
warm, engaging, and attentive to the needs of the Members of Congress 
and our staff. We are all grateful for his care and his work.
  Ralph Seep spent the past 33 years in the Office of the Law Revision 
Counsel, including the past 13 years as head of the office. After a 
long career of helping to oversee and maintain the publication of the 
United States Code, Wade retired on October 1.
  While the Members of Congress write the laws, Ralph was the one who 
ensured that they were literally published in black and white and 
placed into the United States Code.
  Ralph's leadership, high standards of excellence, calm demeanor, and 
generous spirit have made him a trusted leader and colleague and earned 
him the respect of his staff and colleagues.
  On behalf of the entire House of Representatives, I thank Wade and 
Ralph for their service to this Chamber, and we wish them both the best 
in their next stages of life.

               STRENGTHENING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRAEL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to address a 
crucial and escalating situation facing Israel, our close ally. They 
have been under attack not only from isolated factions but from a 
coordinated effort orchestrated by Iran.
  Rockets have rained down on Israel from Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, and

[[Page H6544]]

Yemen, forcing Israel to defend its citizens and its sovereignty from 
these relentless threats. It is crucial to understand that these 
attacks are not random acts of violence but part of a larger, more 
sinister and coordinated plan.
  In each of these regions, there exists a militia backed by Iran. In 
the Gaza Strip, it is Hamas; in Yemen, the Houthis; and in Lebanon, it 
is Hezbollah.
  Recently, with the fall of Assad and the regime in Syria, this very 
much will disrupt some of those efforts that Iran and some of their 
backers in Russia have been able to do in there, but the United States 
and our diplomacy must pay very, very close attention to how this is 
handled because many times when there is a vacuum like this, there can 
be even worse results coming in, such as what happened in Libya and 
Iraq.
  We will have to grade this by what we see as possible new leadership 
coming in, but, indeed, be on top of that so that Iran doesn't get a 
stronger foothold in Syria again.
  It is exacerbated by the policies of previous U.S. administrations 
because of the overall outcome we are seeing. These people are funded, 
supplied, and directed by Iran as part of a calculated strategy to 
encircle and weaken Israel.
  Indeed, they do not want Israel to exist, and it is pretty hard to 
sit down at a negotiation table to come up with peace when they don't 
even acknowledge your right to exist as a nation.
  Unfortunately, the lenient stances taken by Presidents Obama and 
Biden have only encouraged Iran and others in the Middle East to keep 
Israel firmly in the target sights.
  Secretary Blinken recently warned that Iran is potentially within 
weeks of nuclear capabilities. This is not hyperbole. It is a direct 
reality. We have been hearing that for some time, so we don't know what 
that really means, but Iran has been working ever since the JCPOA to 
become a nuclear nation.
  We are witnessing a comprehensive and coordinated assault by Iranian 
militias aimed at Israel. The intent is to strain Israel's defenses 
from every direction. We must recognize and respond to the true nature 
of this threat.
  The National Defense Authorization Act being brought to the floor 
this week in the House takes decisive steps to strengthen our 
partnership with Israel in the face of these ongoing threats. Our 
partnership with Israel is critical for their existence but also for 
us, as they have been a great partner in the Middle East and there are 
so many innovations and things that we do together as countries.
  The NDAA authorizes full funding for joint U.S.-Israel missile 
defense programs, like the Iron Dome, a defensive mechanism. It 
allocates $47 million for cutting-edge technologies, such as anti-
missile laser defenses, and commits $30 million to dismantling Hamas 
tunnel networks.
  As Iran continues its aggression against Israel, these measures 
reaffirm our unwavering support for Israel's right to defend itself and 
its future and to exist. Together, we must ensure that Israel has the 
tools it needs to stand strong.
  Our partnership is ironclad. It is important to both of us. It is 
important to Israeli existence, and even other Arab countries nearby 
have acknowledged that Israel is an important partner due to the 
success of the Abraham Accords.
  If my colleagues ask Arab Israelis who live in the country if they 
like it better in Israel or would rather go back to something else, 
they like it better in Israel.
  There is a lot of good that comes from that nation being able to 
stand on its own, as it has always been a beacon of light and 
opportunity for people who just want to play by a good set of rules.

                      BIDDING FAREWELL TO CONGRESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Allred) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the people of north 
Texas for trusting me with the sacred responsibility and opportunity to 
represent them for the last 6 years. It has been an honor of my life to 
serve the great people of north Texas, who I was born and raised among, 
and to have done it with so many great colleagues.
  I was born and raised in Dallas by a single mom who was a public 
schoolteacher. It wasn't always easy for us, but because of our 
community, because of my family, because of my teachers, my coaches, 
and the good folks at the YMCA, I was able to make it. I played 
Division 1 football at Baylor University. Afterwards, I made the team 
on the Tennessee Titans and spent 5 years as a linebacker. I eventually 
went to law school and became a voting rights attorney, and I proudly 
served the Obama administration at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.
  For the last 6 years, it has been my greatest honor to represent my 
hometown of Dallas and all the communities across the 32nd District 
from Dallas to Richardson to Addison to Mesquite to Garland, 
communities big and small across the DFW area. The folks in north Texas 
have always been my inspiration to get things done.
  I am so proud of all the things we have done together. Working with 
folks in both parties, we secured the Garland VA Medical Center. It 
took over a year, but after countless meetings, phone calls, letters, 
and false starts and stops, we got it done. Together, we created 
thousands of good-paying jobs in north Texas and are helping to better 
serve our veterans and get them the care they have earned. This is one 
of my proudest accomplishments, and I will continue to support local 
efforts to invest and expand the facility.
  We passed historic legislation that will help north Texas and the 
country for years to come: the CHIPS Act, the bipartisan infrastructure 
law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the pandemic relief legislation 
that helped save our economy in a time of deep crisis.
  We lowered the cost of healthcare and kept the cost of insulin for 
seniors at $35 a month. We invested in high-tech manufacturing, job 
training, and clean energy that is helping Texas create thousands upon 
thousands of jobs.
  Because of our efforts, more Texans will have access to economic 
opportunities to enter the middle class and to live their version of 
the American Dream.
  During my time in office, I made a point to introduce legislation 
that was focused on helping people. From voting rights to ensuring 
veterans can access their benefits to cutting red tape and helping 
government work for people, I am so proud that together we worked to 
pass 50 of the bills I cosponsored into law. That doesn't include the 
dozens of amendments, committee work, or administrative actions that we 
had a hand in helping to get done.
  We ran a constituent-first office that was focused on cutting red 
tape for people and helping them get the services and help they needed 
from their government. From helping folks with Social Security to 
assisting veterans to helping our businesses, big and small, keep 
people employed, I am proud that we closed over 4,300 cases and saved 
Texans more than $57 million. I am also personally proud to be the 
first Member of Congress to ever take paternity leave and to hopefully 
set an example for all new dads who will follow me.
  Though this is the end of a chapter for me, I am reminded that our 
democracy is great because it doesn't begin or end with one elected 
official. It is not about one person. It never has been.
  We are caretakers. We are guardians of the great American experiment 
and protectors of this democracy.
  I know that Congresswoman-elect Julie Johnson will serve the people 
of the 32nd District with honor. I thank my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle who have worked with me over the years, people who I know 
will keep working in a bipartisan way to represent and deliver for 
their constituents.
  I remember the legends and icons I have had a chance to serve with, 
Members like Eddie Bernice Johnson to John Lewis.
  I also could not have done this without my wife, Aly, and my two 
boys, Jordan and Cameron, who have helped me every step of the way.
  I thank my staff, who have been on my team and on my side since the 
very beginning. I am so proud that we have had one of the lowest 
turnover rates of any office in Congress. My dedicated staff are public 
servants who have

[[Page H6545]]

helped us serve people here in Washington and in Dallas.
  This was always personal for me, Mr. Speaker. It wasn't just another 
district; it was the place where I was born and raised, where I went to 
high school, where my family lives.
  Mr. Speaker, we served during a time of great uncertainty: a pandemic 
and an insurrection. There is more uncertainty to come, but I believe 
in this country. I believe in the people of north Texas. I know that 
God will continue to bless Texas and our great country.

               DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CAN'T PASS AN AUDIT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bean of Florida). The Chair recognizes 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hoyle) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. HOYLE of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to state my opposition 
to the National Defense Authorization Act.
  First, let me be clear, I support any funding to keep Americans safe, 
protect and fairly compensate our troops for their sacrifices, and to 
improve our national security. I also support some of what is included 
in this act: pay raises for our servicemembers, expanding access to 
contraceptives for female servicemembers under TRICARE, and properly 
funding the replacement of poor and failing military housing and 
barracks.
  However, it is simply irresponsible to give more money to an agency 
that accounts for half of our discretionary spending but can't pass an 
audit. This is an agency that spends over half its budget on defense 
contractors who have no incentive against price gouging, some who 
overcharge the Department of Defense by 40 to 50 percent with no 
accountability and no consequences. Year after year, we dump money into 
defense contractors that grow fatter while our servicemembers and their 
families struggle to scrape by.

  Since the election, we have heard a lot of talk about improving 
government efficiency and cutting waste, and I agree. It is incumbent 
upon us to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, but instead of 
proposing cuts to Social Security benefits for seniors or cutting 
veterans' benefits to our servicemembers, benefits that they have 
earned, let's start where there are clear savings to be had.
  In this NDAA, the Pentagon would get $10 billion more than last year. 
Simply put, the Pentagon just failed its seventh audit, and it is 
getting nearly $900 billion already. Why should we keep writing blank 
checks and expecting things to change when there is no incentive to do 
so?
  Without robust accountability, all this is, is a transfer of wealth 
from hardworking American taxpayers to private defense contractors in 
the military industrial complex. Without meaningful oversight for how 
my constituents' taxpayer dollars are spent, I plan on voting no.

             HONORING REPRESENTATIVE CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers for her 20 years of public service in the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
  Not only is Cathy the first woman Congress Member in history to give 
birth three times while in office, she is also the first woman in 
history to become chairwoman of the powerful and influential Energy and 
Commerce Committee. In addition, Cathy served 6 years in leadership as 
the Republican Conference Chair.
  Cathy and her husband, Brian, and their three children attended the 
same D.C. church that Joe and I attended. I remember going out to lunch 
after church with them and having fun throwing snowballs with their 
kids. I will always remember Cathy giving Bibles to every member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, inviting me and others to Bible studies, 
and walking around the U.S. Capitol after votes praying with other 
Congress Members.
  Mr. Speaker, Cathy has made a difference in this world and in the 
people she has touched. May God continue to bless her and her family. 
She will be missed.


                         Recognizing Lou Hrkman

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of my 
staff, Lou Hrkman, for his dedication and service to me and the 
constituents of Arizona's Eighth Congressional District.
  Lou joined my staff as my energy policy advisor and brought with him 
decades of experience in the energy space, including experience on the 
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and at the Department of Energy 
under President Trump.
  Lou's expertise was key to my work on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and his commitment to advancing sound energy policy was 
critical in the passage of my legislation, Hands Off Our Home 
Appliances and Save Our Gas Stoves Act this Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, as I leave Congress, I have no doubt Lou will go on to 
do great things as he continues his public service. I wish him nothing 
but the best in all of his endeavors. I appreciate him.


                      Recognizing Daniel Stefanski

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of my 
staff, Daniel Stefanski, for his dedication and service to the 
constituents of Arizona's Eighth Congressional District.
  As Members of Congress, we know the importance of communicating our 
work to our constituents, and communications staffers are essential to 
this endeavor.
  Daniel joined my communications team after a career that included 
service to other Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the 
former Attorney General of Arizona. He is a dedicated professional who 
is committed to helping conservatives effectively communicate their 
policy priorities to the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Daniel for his hard work and dedication to me 
and to our team. As I leave Congress, I have no doubt Daniel will go on 
to do great things. I wish him nothing but the best in all of his 
future endeavors. I greatly appreciate him.


                        Recognizing Bobby Bravo

  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize someone whose 
service and dedication to both myself and the State of Arizona are 
unmatched, Bobby Bravo.
  Bobby first came to work for me when I was serving in the Arizona 
State Legislature, and I was honored when he joined me on my 
congressional staff in Washington, D.C.
  My longest serving aide, Bobby is a hard worker with a commitment to 
advancing the policies and priorities that make our Nation and State 
great.
  A native of Mesa, Arizona, and a graduate of Arizona State 
University, Bobby never meets a stranger. Bobby is kind to everyone and 
treats everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their position 
or party affiliation. He always has a smile for anyone he comes in 
contact with.
  When I look back at my time in elected office, Bobby was such an 
important part of my journey, and I thank him for his service and 
commitment to me, our State, and our Nation. I greatly appreciate him.

           CONFUSING ZIP CODES CAUSE UNNECESSARY DIFFICULTIES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Molinaro). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, currently in the United States, some 
municipalities have ZIP Codes that don't match the municipal 
boundaries, and it is a real problem.
  Communities across southeast Wisconsin, including Somers, Mount 
Pleasant, Caledonia, and Franklin have dealt with this unnecessary 
difficulty as a result, so I rise in support of H.R. 8753 to fix this 
problem.
  H.R. 8753 will direct the United States Postal Service to designate 
single, unique ZIP Codes for certain communities.
  When physical mailing addresses differ because multiple ZIP Codes 
converge within one municipality, it causes real confusion.
  Besides mail delivery issues, inaccurate address listings can cause 
delays in service response times, higher

[[Page H6546]]

insurance rates, problems with tax rebates, confusion over polling 
places, and incorrect jury summonses.

                              {time}  1100

  ZIP Codes play an important role in community identity. The 
consequences of inaccurate address listings have been a constant 
frustration for many local officials and the people they serve. In 
fact, Dave DeGroot is the one who brought this to my attention.
  This bill directs USPS to create ZIP Codes that align with municipal 
boundaries. It is a commonsense solution, and I encourage my colleagues 
to support this legislation.


                         ActBlue Investigation

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree foreign funding has 
no place in American elections.
  Over the past year, my Committee on House Administration has 
investigated multiple situations, and in particular the Democratic 
online fundraising platform of ActBlue, identifying and showing the 
vulnerabilities that exist that could be exploited by foreign actors.
  We have uncovered that the platform previously wasn't requiring the 
use of a CVV code. That is the three or four digit number on the back 
of your credit card. It is a simple financial safeguard most online 
companies use to deter bad actors.
  The Committee on House Administration has recently subpoenaed ActBlue 
for documents related to potential foreign influence in campaign 
funding. As chairman, I have introduced legislation to require the CVV 
number and prohibit prepaid cards from being used to make 
contributions, a pathway for foreign entities, including drug cartels, 
to launder money.
  The SHIELD Act would prohibit political committees from accepting 
online contributions unless the contributor provides the CVV number and 
the billing address associated with the card and also prohibit them 
from accepting online contributions from prepaid cards.
  It is imperative that we are increasing trust and transparency in our 
elections. All parties should be complying with Federal election law, 
including campaign finance laws.
  Foreign actors have no place contributing in American elections. They 
have no place in contributing to American political campaigns. I will 
continue working to prevent foreign funding in our elections.

                     AMERICA NEEDS MEDICARE FOR ALL

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Khanna) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, across our land, there is outrage at private 
health insurance companies that are denying claims: denying claims for 
heart disease, denying claims for cancer, denying claims for diabetes.
  Mr. Speaker, the average cancer patient in America will lose their 
entire life savings in 2 years. Forty-two percent of Americans who have 
cancer lose their life savings in 2 years. Mr. Speaker, 18 percent of 
Americans have had their healthcare claims denied, over 3.4 million 
Americans.
  On a very small matter, I had my healthcare claim denied by 
UnitedHealthcare when I wanted to get a $100 nasal pump for allergies. 
Back it came: denied. I couldn't get that reversed. Imagine people with 
more serious problems.
  One of the people in my district, Sarah Broughton, died of a sinus 
infection because her health insurance companies denied her claims for 
basic healthcare.
  As Americans face denial after denial after denial, what is happening 
with these private insurance companies? Let me tell you: $1.4 trillion 
in revenue, $70 billion in profits for the top seven private insurance 
companies. They say, oh, it is only 5 percent profit, but it is $1.4 
trillion sucked out of our economy while basic Americans are denied 
healthcare.
  What is this money going to? It is going to administrative costs. It 
is going to advertising. It is going to bloated executive pay salaries 
while we can't give people treatment for cancer, for diabetes, for 
basic health issues.
  The American people are outraged, and they are rising up across our 
country, demanding fundamental change to a broken healthcare system. 
Enough.
  Here are three things that we could do: First, if a doctor prescribes 
a medicine, the private insurance company must cover it if Medicare 
covers it. That is common sense.
  Second, let us cap out-of-pocket costs so you don't have someone who 
has cancer depleting their entire life savings. Cap those costs at 
$2,000 a year.
  Third, let us make sure that these private insurance companies can't 
rely on AI to have AI-generated algorithms that deny claims. No AI used 
to deny Americans' claims.
  Really, what we need, Mr. Speaker, is what so many other democracies 
have. We need Medicare for All. The reality is, the average American is 
paying more than $6,000 a year on healthcare costs, and those premiums 
are up 7 percent from last year. We are not going to get those premiums 
down. We are not going to get those healthcare costs down unless we 
have Medicare for All.
  When we have Medicare for All, we will have 2 percent administrative 
fees. Medicare will be able to negotiate with the hospitals and the 
pharmaceutical companies to lower costs for all Americans and provide 
care.
  Guess what. If we have Medicare for All, every doctor and every 
hospital will be in network. No more of these denied claims that are 
bankrupting Americans and taking people's lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I represent a district in Silicon Valley that has $12 
trillion of value: Apple, Google, Nvidia, Tesla. We are producing more 
wealth in my ZIP Code than anyplace in human history. How is it that in 
the wealthiest nation in the world when we are producing more wealth 
than ever before, Americans can't get basic healthcare?
  Healthcare is a human right. We have the money to make sure every 
American is covered and not denied. It is time for change. It is time 
to hold private health insurance companies accountable. It is time to 
fight and pass Medicare for All.

     CONGRATULATING MICA MOUNTAIN HIGH SCHOOL VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mica 
Mountain High School varsity football team for winning the 4A State 
championship, the first title in the school's history.
  The fourth-seed Mica Mountain Thunderbolts overcame the odds and beat 
second-seed Arizona College Prep by a resounding score of 42-13 and 
capped their perfect 14-0 season with a majestic trophy.
  The Thunderbolts attacked early and quickly, scoring on each of their 
opening four drives and leading by a score of 28-7 at halftime. They 
were led by star running back Josiah Thornwell, who finished the night 
with 182 yards and four touchdowns.
  Considering that Mica Mountain only became a school 4\1/2\ years ago, 
it is remarkable to see how much the students and staff have 
accomplished in such a short time, setting a strong foundation for 
future classes to build upon.
  Moreover, this was Coach Nugent's first championship in his 34 years 
of coaching. Coach Nugent did a great job.
  Coach Nugent, all the coaching staff, the players, the 
administration, the school, the students and everyone who had their 
hand in this special season made their school and our community 
extremely proud. This is their victory. They earned it. Go on and enjoy 
it.


                      Congratulating Micah Powell

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Micah Powell 
for an outstanding tenure as mayor of Eloy.
  Since the day he took office 4 years ago, Micah has been a devoted 
public servant who cared deeply for the residents of Eloy and dedicated 
himself to serving his community with genuine passion and a tireless 
work ethic.
  During his tenure, Micah focused on bringing more jobs and housing 
opportunities for the residents and promoting businesses and economic 
growth. In my time in Congress, I am deeply proud of the strong 
Federal-local partnership Micah and I forged to benefit our 
constituents. In FY25, we worked together to initially secure $1

[[Page H6547]]

million to repair and revitalize the historic Frontier Street, which 
serves as the main gateway to downtown Eloy.
  While Micah's leadership will be missed, his public service will 
continue to be felt in his community long after his tenure and far into 
the future.
  I also congratulate the outgoing and incoming leadership of Eloy. I 
look forward to working with all of them in advance and our district to 
continue to look forward and advance our community always.
  Again, congratulations to my friend Micah. He deserves it.

  (Mr. COLLINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand that Texas be sent 
back to the Big 12 and to congratulate the 2024 SEC champions, the 
Georgia Bulldogs. After the Dawgs' historic win over the Longhorns the 
SEC's championship over the weekend, which, by the way, was the second 
time Georgia has beat Texas this season, the Dawgs have proved, without 
a doubt, that Texas just ain't ready for SEC ball.
  What an incredible win, Mr. Speaker. Not only did the Dawgs 
absolutely smoke Texas in overtime, but they did it with class, style, 
and a backup quarterback.
  This is the 15th SEC championship in Georgia history, and the Dawgs 
aren't done yet.
  As we move into the playoffs, don't let off the gas.
  The Dawgs have got a national championship to bring back to Athens, 
and don't let anyone stop them.
  Mr. Speaker, Go Dawgs.

                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  Holy and eternal God, the source of light in our darkness and the 
hope of our world in these days and always, help us in opening our eyes 
to and rejoice in the hope that is ours on this day.
  Teach us how to be patient in tribulation, to refrain from getting 
caught up in the arguments that pit one side against one another, to 
avoid fueling fires of discord and division. Show us instead how to 
reach within our souls and draw from Your deep well of mercy and Your 
steadfast loving kindness, that the urgency and sense of instancy to 
react would dissolve into forbearance with one another and a calm that 
will enable us to see Your will.
  Even as we pause to bow our heads in this moment, may we be inspired 
to be constant in prayer, to realize that You walk with us throughout 
the day, ever available to receive our petitions, to hear our 
pleadings, and to respond to our deepest needs.
  Reveal Your divine spirit among us today as we claim Your name in 
prayer.
  Amen.

                           RECIPE FOR SUCCESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bean) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is that time of year. Everyone 
is talking about who has the best recipes for pies or who has the best 
recipes for cookies.
  I don't know about those, Mr. Speaker, but I can tell you who has got 
the best recipe for an amazing elementary school environment: Paterson 
Elementary in Clay County, Florida.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of the best schools in the 
Nation. The Florida Department of Education recently released their 
elementary school rankings for the 2023-2024 school year, and out of 
411 in the Sunshine State, Clay County's very own Paterson Elementary 
placed in the top 10.
  Mr. Speaker, 86 percent of the fourth and fifth graders showed 
massive learning gains in math last year, not to mention 98 percent of 
sixth graders. Talk about an A-plus in learning momentum.
  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am putting their report card on my refrigerator. 
Abby and I recently visited the campus and saw firsthand how educators 
at Paterson Elementary cultivate truly exceptional students by doing 
their job with hard work, love, and care.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
everyone at Paterson Elementary for their incredible recipe for 
success.
  I say to Paterson Elementary: Keep up the great work, and go get `em.


                  Orange Park Elementary Ranked First

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is that time of year: Everybody 
is debating on school rankings. Where does your school rank? Are you in 
the top 12?
  Mr. Speaker, I can tell you who is number one. It is Orange Park 
Elementary in Orange Park, Florida.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Orange Park Elementary School's rise 
to the top. The Florida Department of Education recently released their 
rankings for the 2023-2024 school year, and out of 411 schools 
statewide, Clay County's very own Orange Park Elementary was ranked 
number one.
  Mr. Speaker, 93 percent of fourth graders showed impressive learning 
gains in math last year, as well as 91 percent of fifth graders. Mr. 
Speaker, 95 percent of sixth graders saw the same results.
  How is that for a report card? Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am putting their 
report card on my refrigerator.
  I commend all of the teachers and administrators at Orange Park 
Elementary for their passion and hard work in shaping the future of our 
great State: our kids.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Orange Park Elementary for the incredible example they set for schools 
around the country. It is not easy being number one.
  I say to Orange Park: Keep up the great work, and go get `em.

            INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge International 
Human Rights Day, observed annually on December 10, to commemorate the 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
  This landmark document was signed by the United Nations General 
Assembly on December 10, 1948, with contributions of representatives 
from all regions with different legal and cultural backgrounds to 
create a universal structure and standard of fundamental human rights.

[[Page H6548]]

  This year's theme, ``Our Rights, Our Future, Our Now,'' is a call to 
address the formidable year of human rights suppression, wartime 
atrocities, and transactional democracy, including renewed hostilities 
between Israel and Hamas, the ongoing crisis in Haiti, and backsliding 
democracies in the Sahel region of Africa.
  Millions worldwide face violations of their basic rights, and the 
very system we rely upon is under threat.
  Today, and every day, let us renew our commitment to the universal 
protection of human rights where all people are entitled to live with 
dignity, respect, and equality.

                          ____________________

                 CELEBRATING RETIREMENT OF PETER KIELTY

  (Mrs. RODGERS of Washington asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
trusted adviser and friend, Peter Kielty, who is retiring at the end of 
this year.
  Peter has served the House Energy and Commerce Committee with 
distinction for 25 years, including currently as general counsel.
  Former Chair Fred Upton said: Peter worked as hard as the day is long 
and is a part of the legacy of its success.
  Former Chair Greg Walden said: In a town filled with attention 
seekers, Peter worked harder than anyone I know to put the committee 
and its members in the spotlight and never himself. The committee, the 
Congress, and the country are better off because of Peter Kielty.
  I echo those sentiments, but to me, it is his charm, wit, and 
relentless kindness that will be his lasting legacy for the committee.
  I thank Peter for his public service, and I wish him and his wife, 
Mary, nothing but the best in the next chapter of their lives.
  May God bless Peter.

             HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SUZANNE MURRAY

  (Mr. MAGAZINER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Suzanne Murray, a humanitarian and philanthropist who made it her 
life's work to advocate for women's education.
  Born in Providence, Sue was an accomplished student who attended 
Henry Barnard School, the Lincoln School, and Radcliffe College, where 
she discovered a passion for education and found the love of her life, 
Terry Murray.
  The Murrays settled in Warwick and later Narragansett, raising five 
children.
  Sue devoted her time giving back to her alma maters, serving as chair 
of the board of the Lincoln School and as a trustee at Radcliffe, among 
many other leadership positions.
  In 2003, Lincoln named its middle school the Murray Middle School in 
her honor.
  In 1997, Sue and Terry cofounded the Murray Family Charitable 
Foundation to support education, healthcare, and the arts in southern 
New England. She assisted in the founding of Sophia Academy, a middle 
school in Providence for girls. Her work to expand access to education, 
particularly for young women, has made a difference in countless lives 
across Rhode Island and beyond.
  I join Sue's family and loved ones in celebrating her remarkable 
life.

                      SAFEGUARDING OUR FREE SPEECH

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act is 
more than just a defense bill. It is a safeguard for free speech.
  How can that be?
  It is because within its pages, Congress took an important step to 
protect the First Amendment by prohibiting the Department of Defense 
from partnering with advertising firms such as NewsGuard which unfairly 
targets conservative news sources as untrustworthy.
  Stopping censorship and ensuring the government isn't using taxpayer 
dollars to silence viewpoints it doesn't like under the pretense of 
misinformation is essential for free press.
  By including this provision, the NDAA ensures that Federal agencies 
can't act as gatekeepers for acceptable speech or manipulate the flow 
of information.
  At a time when cancel culture seems to have no boundaries, this is a 
much-needed step to keep the government out of the business of picking 
winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas, especially in 
information that needs to get out to the public.
  The NDAA sends a clear message: Free speech isn't a privilege; it is 
a right for us to know.

                  CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS

  (Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate our 
2024 Congressional App Challenge winners during Computer Science 
Education Week.
  Lydia Denton, an 11th grader, and Bethany Denton, a 9th grader from 
Wilson Early College Academy, were inspired to create BITES Bento Box 
after seeing a friend with diabetes struggle to track blood sugar and 
accurately dose insulin levels.
  The BITES Bento app pairs a hardware Bento Box with an app to 
dynamically calculate the macros consumed in food. Using the Bento Box 
to get the most accurate information, the user can weigh food before 
and after eating.
  Our winners, who are also sisters, demonstrated great application and 
innovation.
  Congratulations to Lydia and Bethany on this fantastic 
accomplishment.

              CELEBRATING COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Computer Science Education Week.
  Computer Science Education Week is a chance for students of all ages 
to learn about the importance and benefits of computer science and the 
endless professional opportunities that abound with a skills-based 
education.
  In today's world, technology influences every sector: healthcare, 
agriculture, transportation, entertainment, and beyond.
  Yet, many students are growing up without exposure to the 
foundational skills that power this innovation. Only about one-half of 
schools in the United States offer any kind of computer science 
coursework. That is a gap we cannot afford to ignore.
  As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, 
I have been proud to work across the aisle to invest in cutting-edge 
CTE programming that, in many cases, now incorporates computer science 
courses.
  Our Nation desperately needs skilled workers, and career and 
technical education is a win-win. It can offer rewarding professional 
futures for learners of all ages while closing the Nation's skill gap.
  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Computer Science Education Week, we 
recognize the importance of equipping our young people with the skills 
they need to navigate and contribute to an increasingly digital world.

                          ____________________

                             END HUNGER NOW

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before Thanksgiving, I joined the 15th 
Annual March for the Food Bank, a 43-mile journey through western 
Massachusetts, led by the incredible Monte Belmonte along with Andrew 
Morehouse, the director of the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts, and 
his amazing team, countless advocates, students, and local elected 
officials.

[[Page H6549]]

  Together, we broke records, raising over $600,000, equivalent to 1.7 
million meals for families in need. I am inspired every year by the 
resilience of the walkers and the generosity of the community.
  I also want to recognize New England Public Media and 93.9, ``The 
River,'' for amplifying this cause and inspiring others to join the 
fight, but let's be clear. Charity alone cannot end hunger. Congress 
must do its part by further improving our antihunger safety net and 
supporting programs like SNAP, WIC, TEFAP, and universal school meals 
nationwide.
  The March for the Food Bank is one step we are taking in 
Massachusetts to improve food security. Hunger is solvable, and it is 
time for us to end hunger now.

      CELEBRATING RETIREMENT OF COLONEL ROBERT R. ``BART'' BARTRAN

  (Mr. EZELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Robert Bartran 
for his remarkable 36 years of dedicated service to the Mississippi 
Army National Guard.
  Over the course of his distinguished career, Colonel Bartran has 
exemplified what it means to be a true leader--selfless, committed, and 
always ready to serve.
  His service has not only protected our Nation but also strengthened 
our State and enriched the communities that he has sworn to defend. He 
has answered the call of duty with distinction, representing the State 
of Mississippi with pride and honor.
  In his role as the director of the counterdrug program for the 
Mississippi National Guard and as commandant of the Regional 
Counterdrug Training Academy at Naval Air Station Meridian, Colonel 
Bartran has made an incredible mark on the battle against illegal drugs 
and organized crime.
  His leadership has not only advanced the mission but has also guided 
countless servicemembers, empowering them to make a difference in their 
own communities.

  His vision and dedication remain a steady force, driving the success 
of future generations of guardsmen and -women.
  On behalf of all Mississippians, we are deeply grateful for Colonel 
Bartran's extraordinary contributions to our State, Nation, and 
military.
  I thank Colonel Bartran for his tireless commitment, leadership, and 
unwavering service. As he enters this new chapter of his life, we wish 
him nothing but success, happiness, and fulfillment.

                    CINDERELLA STORY OF ASU FOOTBALL

  (Mr. STANTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a team from my 
district, a team that is a Cinderella story for all ages, the Arizona 
State University football team.
  A couple of years ago, the team was in bad shape. This year, the team 
was coming off two straight seasons of only three wins, their worst 
stretch since the 1940s.
  Coach Kenny Dillingham was hired a couple of years ago, the youngest 
head coach in Division 1 college football. He grew up in Phoenix. He 
worked hard at rebuilding this program.
  Their star player, running back Cam Skattebo, had only one college 
scholarship coming out of high school. Analysts predicted that ASU 
would finish dead last in their first season in the Big 12 Conference, 
16th out of 16 teams.
  No one believed in them, but they believed in themselves. They are a 
testament to what anyone can achieve when they show up, work hard, and 
are good teammates. They won 11-2 this season, undefeated at home for 
the first time in 20 years.
  Just this past Saturday, they had a massive victory over Iowa State 
and won the Big 12 Conference championship, solidifying their place as 
one of the best comeback stories in Arizona history.
  They are now one of the best teams in the United States. No one is 
underestimating them now. Coach Dillingham and the people's Heisman 
winner, Cam Skattebo, and this team are easy to root for. They have 
activated our valley like never before. Onward to Victory and Forks Up.

                         PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the military protects the 
freedom of all American families, and we must provide adequate support 
to retain our ability to have peace through strength.
  Tomorrow, the House will consider the Servicemember Quality of Life 
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act to improve the lives 
of servicemembers and their families and strengthen national security 
with the energetic leadership of Chairman   Mike Rogers.
  This bill supports the deployment of the National Guard to the 
southern border, deters the Chinese Communist Party, combats anti-
Semitism, blocks war criminal Putin, supports Israel, cuts inefficient 
programs, and guts woke programs at the Department of Defense.
  The legislation improves the quality of life of servicemembers with 
housing upgrades, pay raises, lower healthcare wait times, better 
access to childcare, employment support for spouses, and more.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism 
continues. Open borders for dictators put all American families at risk 
of imminent 9/11 attacks, as warned by the FBI.
  Trump will reinstitute existing laws to protect American families 
with peace through strength. I congratulate Chairman-elect Brian Mast.

House Resolution 1612, providing for consideration of three measures, 
including the Senate amendment to H.R. 5009, the Servicemember Quality 
of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

  The rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the 
Committee on Armed Services or his designee that the House concur in 
the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 118-52.
  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate on the motion, equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Armed Services 
Committee or their respective designees.
  The rule also provides that the chair of the Armed Services Committee 
may insert into the Congressional Record, not later than December 10, 
2024, such material as he may deem explanatory of the Senate amendment 
and the motion specified in section 3.
  Additionally, the rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 7673, 
the Liberty in Laundry Act, under a closed rule.
  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce or their respective designees, and provides for one motion 
to recommit.
  Further, the rule provides for consideration of S. 4199, the Judicial 
Understaffing Delays Getting Emergencies Solved Act of 2024, under a 
closed rule.
  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary or their respective designees, and provides for one motion to 
recommit.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the rule and the underlying 
piece of legislation, beginning with the Servicemember Quality of Life 
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2025.
  Mr. Speaker, under the leadership of Speaker   Mike Johnson, Chairman 
  Mike Rogers, Ranking Member Adam Smith, and additional colleagues in 
the House and Senate, the fiscal year 2025 National Defense 
Authorization Act represents the result of months of bipartisan and 
bicameral collaboration.
  It is a bill that balances the needs of our servicemen and -women and 
the fiscal challenges facing our Nation. The NDAA significantly 
improves the quality of life for our servicemembers, deters our 
adversaries, supports our allies, and focuses on military readiness and 
our national security.
  Our country is facing serious threats to our security and freedom at 
levels that we have not seen since World War II. It is imperative for 
our national security that our servicemembers and their families are 
supported so that they can focus on their mission.
  Ahead of the NDAA, Chairman Rogers established a panel to evaluate 
the quality of life for our servicemembers and found that 
servicemembers' standards of living are a major cause of low morale and 
family stress. This undermines our recruitment, retention, and military 
readiness.

                              {time}  1230

  The NDAA puts our servicemembers and their families first and 
addresses many of the issues found by the Quality of Life Panel. This 
legislation boosts compensation, improves housing, expands access to 
medical care, increases access to childcare, and provides support for 
the spouses of servicemembers.
  Through the tireless work of the House Armed Services Committee and 
Rules Committee staff, the NDAA advances important policies to support 
our warfighters at home and abroad and deters our adversaries.
  The National Defense Authorization Act ensures that our Nation's 
military is organized, trained, and equipped to deter our adversaries. 
Communist China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and any other nation or 
terrorist group must know that they will never succeed in a war with 
the United States of America.
  To strengthen our defense, the NDAA supports the continued 
modernization of our nuclear deterrent. It invests in our naval fleet, 
increases innovation, and revitalizes our defense industrial base to 
ensure our warfighters have the capabilities they need to win on future 
battlefields.
  The NDAA restores American deterrence by restoring lethality, 
defending Israel, securing our southern border, and providing oversight 
and accountability.
  We must continue to modernize our military. The NDAA fosters 
innovation by providing for the development and fielding of artificial 
intelligence, hypersonics, quantum computing, and autonomous systems.
  The NDAA builds and maintains the overmatch we need to deter China. 
This legislation counters Communist China's maligned global influence 
in Africa, South America, and Central America. The NDAA removes 
Communist China from our supply chains and prevents CCP spies from 
infiltrating our research institutions.
  The NDAA bolsters Taiwan's defense and support of our Indo-Pacific 
allies as they work to deter our shared adversaries. This legislation 
also supports our ally Israel as they defend themselves from Hamas 
terrorists by fully funding cooperative missile defense programs and 
expanding emerging technology research and development efforts.
  The NDAA reforms and improves the acquisition process by streamlining 
the budgeting, milestone, and contracting processes making them more 
efficient, user-friendly, and less costly.
  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the NDAA includes language that saves our 
taxpayers over $31 billion by cutting inefficient programs, obsolete 
weapons, and Pentagon bureaucracy.
  We live in the greatest Nation on Earth, and it is imperative that we 
support those who protect our freedoms.
  Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2025 NDAA is another step in that 
direction.
  Now, moving on to H.R. 7673, the Liberty in Laundry Act.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill is simple. It clarifies the intent of the 
Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 by prohibiting the Secretary of 
Energy from imposing new efficiency mandates or enforcing existing 
standards for washing machines unless these standards: one, are cost-
effective and technologically feasible; two, save the consumers money; 
and three, save a significant amount of energy.
  The Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 already requires the 
Department of Energy to follow specific criteria for prescribing new 
efficiency standards and the DOE may only propose the new standard if 
the new standard results in a significant conservation of energy, is 
technologically feasible, and economically justified.
  The DOE, under President Biden, has consistently ignored the consumer 
protections built into the underlying statute and has used efficiency 
and appliance standards to pursue climate objectives over consumer 
choice. They have attempted to impose these mandates on every appliance 
in our homes: gas stoves, clothes dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, 
and air-conditioners.
  These mandates have increased the cost of appliances, undercut 
appliance production quality, and jeopardized

[[Page H6551]]

consumer choice. It is just another example of executive overreach that 
has made the cost of living for everyday Americans more expensive.
  If the Biden administration had proposed standards in accordance with 
the law, H.R. 7673 wouldn't be coming to the floor.
  Finally, we have S. 4199, the JUDGES Act of 2024. It is another 
simple bill, Mr. Speaker.
  Congress last comprehensively updated judgeships for the district 
courts in the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990. Since then, the 
population of the United States has grown by nearly 100 million people 
and Federal caseload has increased by 40 percent.
  In the last 20 years, civil cases pending more than 3 years have 
increased 346 percent and the average time between filing cases and 
trial is over 2 years, but often it is 3 to 4 years.
  This bill is based off the 2023 recommendations of the Judicial 
Conference of the United States and increases district judgeships by 66 
over time, splitting the new judges into six tranches across at least 
two Presidential administrations.
  Additionally, S. 4199 amends certain districts in Utah, Texas, and 
California, and requires a GAO report on the caseload of district 
courts and courts of appeals with recommendations on how to alleviate 
any caseload-related challenges.
  Mr. Speaker, to simplify it further, this bill requires the President 
to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, new judgeships 
for certain district courts by each of the years 2025, 2027, 2029, 
2031, 2033, and 2035.
  That is across six different Congresses, across three different 
Presidential terms, and at least two different Presidential 
administrations.
  This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in August. I will 
say that again, Mr. Speaker. This bill passed the Senate by unanimous 
consent in August, and the House should now do its part to address the 
workload demands in the courts.

  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to consideration of these important 
pieces of legislation and urge passage of this rule.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my 
colleague from Rules (Mr. Austin Scott) for the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, families all across the United States want Congress to 
help lower the cost of living, whether it is the single mom working to 
put enough food on the table for her kids or an elder who tries to 
stretch their Social Security as much as possible. Millions of 
Americans also worry about the cost of their utilities. Indeed, utility 
bills are at the heart of our most basic needs. They are some of the 
highest costs that working families have to think about each month.
  H.R. 7673, the Liberty in Laundry Act--yes, I know. Some chuckle just 
by hearing the title--but the Liberty in Laundry Act betrays Americans' 
desire for lower costs because it increases utility bills. Energy-
efficient washing machines can save the average family up to $285 over 
the washing machine's lifetime.
  Republicans would take away these savings with these bills. This 
isn't the first appliance where Republicans are raising costs. 
Republicans are making your refrigerators, dishwashers, and stoves even 
more expensive to operate. With these bills attacking energy 
efficiency, they are definitely not looking after American working 
families.
  Who are they really protecting?
  With just 6 more days in the congressional calendar this year, we 
have a laundry list. Indeed, we need to talk about laundry, but it is 
the laundry list of unfinished business that Congress should be doing 
for the American people.
  However, my colleagues across the aisle decided that a washing 
machine is more important than Social Security, the farm bill, 
nutrition programs, and so much more.
  I am here to tell you, when I am in New Mexico, my constituents never 
ask me what I am doing about washers and dryers unless, of course, I am 
lost in the hardware store.
  They do ask, however, about saving Social Security and lowering the 
cost of medicine. While Democrats have worked hard to protect Social 
Security and lower healthcare costs, what do we hear from the other 
side? Trump's billionaire bros were just here and they said his plans 
would ``necessarily involve some temporary hardship,'' from billionaire 
bro Musk.
  Now, I need to tell you, if you are a billionaire, a little bit of 
hardship, you are not going to face with some of the cuts they are 
talking. Working families will suffer.
  This rule also includes the National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2025. I am pleased that so much of this year's NDAA is 
rooted in improving the quality of life for our servicemembers and 
their families.
  These measures, some of which were described by my colleague, include 
things like the 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted 
servicemembers and 4.5 percent pay raise for all other servicemembers. 
They are going to provide our military personnel with the resources 
they deserve.
  Indeed, it is the care for our servicemembers and the shared goal of 
increased military readiness that typically makes the NDAA very 
bipartisan. That is why it is, indeed, disappointing that the 
Republican majority decided to use the NDAA to attack military families 
with the inclusion of a provision to attack transgender children.
  As Ranking Member Smith eloquently discussed at Rules last night, for 
the first time, the NDAA is attacking a family member's right to choose 
the healthcare they need for their kids. He pointed out that there are 
thousands of families who rely on medical care to improve the lives of 
children who suffer from gender dysphoria.
  Imagine, you are serving in the Marines because you and your family 
love your country, but your child is suffering. He comes to you, she 
comes to you, their pain is so great that they tell you they are 
contemplating suicide. Of course, as a parent, you want to do 
everything you can to help your child, and the medical profession has 
tools that can help. They can help you treat your child, save your 
child, make sure your child leads a healthy, happy life, but Congress 
is now telling that marine, you can't get the medical help your child 
needs.
  Congress is telling that marine: We know better.
  The Committee on Armed Services did not ask for this ban on 
transgender healthcare for minors. That was explained to us last night 
in Rules. This did not come out of the Committee whose goal is to look 
at armed services. No, this proposed ban was inserted by Speaker 
Johnson.
  What Republicans are doing is interfering with a parent's ability to 
get healthcare for their children.
  Why do Republicans keep interfering in personal healthcare decisions?
  We have Republican politicians sitting on the examination table when 
a parent is trying to get their children care just like they sit on the 
examination table when women are trying to get reproductive healthcare.
  This mean provision is a stain on the bipartisan NDAA.
  I don't know why Republicans keep launching culture wars when the 
NDAA should focus on preventing wars.
  Finally, the rule also includes the JUDGES Act, adding Federal judges 
to ensure we guarantee justice in America. We worked on a bipartisan 
bargain to do just that. Democrats and Republicans negotiated a good, 
fair deal to pass this bill, but the deal was to pass it before the 
election so we could ensure impartiality before anybody knew who had 
won.
  Republican leadership went back on that deal and refused to move the 
bill until Donald Trump won. That is a huge breach of trust.
  How are we supposed to negotiate unless the other side keeps their 
promise?
  Republicans broke their word and broke the deal.
  Time and again, the Republican majority shows the American people 
that their priorities are power and partisanship. They did it again 
with a closed rule for each of these bills, so Congress cannot debate 
any amendments that were offered.
  Members should have the opportunity to debate. The American people 
should have the opportunity to hear where their Representatives stand 
on these issues, where they will vote on amendments, but we keep 
getting denied the right to have any amendments

[[Page H6552]]

debated on this floor in the people's House.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I will take just a second 
to read to the American citizens the provision that the Democratic 
Party, at least some in the Democratic Party, are using as an excuse to 
vote against the National Defense Authorization Act.
  I will read this word for word: ``Medical interventions for the 
treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization may 
not be provided to a child under the age of 18.''
  Let me read that one more time, Mr. Speaker. ``Medical interventions 
for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in 
sterilization may not be provided to a child under the age of 18.''

                              {time}  1245

  That is the provision that they are talking about that is their 
excuse for voting against the National Defense Authorization Act.
  We are talking about children under the age of 18, and we are saying 
that we are not going to allow a surgical procedure on them that could 
lead to or result in sterilization.
  I don't understand why we are even having this discussion. It defies 
logic to me that it is even legal to do that to a child under the age 
of 18. These are permanent and irreversible procedures, and they should 
not be allowed.
  Mr. Speaker, they certainly shouldn't be an excuse to vote against 
the National Defense Authorization Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I point out, once again, that these 
are decisions, individual decisions with regard to gender care that a 
marine, a naval officer, or enlisted personnel are making in 
consultation with their doctors and for their family. We are saying we 
know better.
  I would also point out what happens if your child has not gotten the 
care they need and have taken their life? Fifty-six percent of 
transgender youth attempt suicide.
  When the Republican Governor of Utah was vetoing a transgender ban, 
his words were so moving. He said: I don't really understand this, but 
it is not my place to understand those decisions. This is what haunts 
me is his statement: ``But I want them to live.'' That is a quote. 
``But I want them to live.''
  We should want all of our children to live, and we should let the 
parents of those children take actions so that their children can live.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the 
Committee on Rules and my dear friend and mentor.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I feel like I am living in an alternative 
reality right now.
  Liberty in laundry? I mean, liberty in laundry? Are you kidding me, 
Mr. Speaker? I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Who came up with the 
title? ChatGPT? What is next, changing the national motto to ``lint 
free or die''?
  It is no surprise coming from the same Republican Party that gave us 
the Refrigerator Freedom Act and the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. 
I mean, is something wrong with them? I ask that seriously, Mr. 
Speaker. Americans voted for lower grocery prices, not whatever the 
hell this is. This is insane.
  As I listen to the gentleman on the other side talk about lowering 
costs for consumers, I have to wonder what bill is he talking about 
because it is definitely not this one.
  This bill gives big companies license to cut corners and make bad 
appliances that use more electricity and water. I mean, to put it 
simply, they object to appliances that save consumers money on their 
bills. What the hell planet are these guys living on where that saves 
people money?
  I remember, Mr. Speaker, when a washing machine used to last 30 
years. People could go their whole lives without buying a new 
refrigerator. Now they break all the time. Why is that? It is because 
these big, huge companies cut corners and because my Republican friends 
are letting them do it right here and right now.
  That is what this is all about. That is the Republican solution: Let 
the appliance companies cut corners so they can make a buck, say it 
will lower costs, and then turn around and act surprised when 
everyone's crappy washing machine breaks down in 2 years.
  This bill is about one thing. It is about making money for big 
corporations at the expense of everyone else. That is all my Republican 
friends care about.
  Then we have the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 
2025. I have to tell you, the military budget is out of control. We are 
looking at over a trillion dollars. I mean, does anyone here realize 
how much money that is? This is for an agency that cannot even pass an 
audit. Not once in 33 years has the DOD been able to pass an audit.
  Meanwhile, I hear from every one of my friends on the other side of 
the aisle about the deficit, the deficit, the deficit. There are long 
diatribes about the national debt. Where is that energy and passion 
today as we are talking about an agency that probably wastes more money 
in a second than most people earn in a year?
  The kicker here is that all this money we spend on the military, a 
huge chunk of it doesn't even go to our troops. It goes to defense 
contractors. It goes to their CEOs. It goes to the military-industrial 
complex. There is no discussion of that on the floor today--just more 
money, more money, more money for the Pentagon.
  When does it all end?
  Don't worry, though, the Republicans found time to strip out language 
on in vitro fertilization for our servicemembers. They found a way to 
deny people IVF because of their extreme views on everything under the 
Sun. Women's rights, family rights, you name it, they are against it.
  They also found a way to talk about transgender people, their weird 
obsession. They talk about transgender people and bathrooms more than 
they talk about jobs and the economy. They never miss an opportunity to 
divide people, to double down on the cruelty.
  Once again, the agenda of this majority is just all screwed up, and 
today's rule is just the latest example of how wrong their priorities 
are.
  Mr. Speaker, before I forget, I have one last thing. This rule that 
we are debating provides for three more completely closed rules on 
legislation. This is the most closed Congress in history. This is the 
most authoritarian House in U.S. history. My colleagues are making 
Putin proud. But I will tell you this: It is lousy for democracy.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I do want to acknowledge 
that the citizens did vote for lower gas prices, grocery prices, secure 
borders, and extension of the Tax Code.

  I again want to read the provision of the bill: Medical interventions 
for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in 
sterilization may not be provided to a child--a child, Mr. Speaker--
under the age of 18.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, 
I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 9643, a bill to 
protect and expand nationwide access to fertility treatment, including 
in vitro fertilization.
  Mr. Speaker, Republicans have been relentless on their attacks 
against reproductive healthcare rights, including IVF treatments that 
are so important to millions of Americans hoping to start a family.
  Just recently, the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of the 
NDAA contained provisions to improve IVF access for our servicemembers. 
However, what did Republicans do? They stripped those provisions from 
the legislation we are considering today. They stripped the 
recommendations to allow access to IVF treatment.
  Simply put, that is why we must defeat the previous question and pass 
H.R. 9643, to ensure that IVF treatment is protected for all Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material 
immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild) to discuss our proposal.

[[Page H6553]]

  

  Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, there are only 2 weeks left of this Congress 
and I, along with many of my colleagues, want to use that time to do 
useful things that will actually help the American people.
  Instead, House Republicans and Speaker Johnson have us debating the 
Liberty in Laundry Act, but I am here today to urge my colleagues to 
consider a vote on the Right to IVF Act, a bill that I have been proud 
to lead this Congress, which would protect the right of Americans 
across the country to receive fertility treatments.
  I wish we were not facing unprecedented times, where even our most 
basic freedoms, including the freedom to start or grow your family, are 
at risk.
  Like so many hopeful parents, I struggled with my own fertility when 
having my children, and I am so grateful that there were no government 
restrictions on what was available to me. That would have made an 
already heartbreaking situation even more heartbreaking.
  Unfortunately, politicians and judges across the country are now 
threatening to strip hopeful parents of that right. Imagine looking at 
a couple who has been hoping and praying for a baby for years and has 
struggled to conceive or a cancer patient who has been told by their 
oncologist that treatment could destroy their fertility, and then 
telling them that they can no longer turn to IVF.
  Imagine a military couple in the midst of IVF treatments in one State 
where they are permitted, then being transferred to a new post in a 
State that forbids IVF.
  Since long before my time in Congress, I have believed that judges 
and politicians have no place in your bedroom or doctor's office, and 
that your personal medical decisions are yours alone to make. That is 
why I am proud to be the House lead of the Right to IVF Act, which 
would ensure hopeful parents across the country have access to the 
fertility treatments they need and to expand insurance coverage to make 
those treatments more affordable.
  With an incoming administration that has promised to roll back 
reproductive rights, it is more crucial than ever that we pass the 
Right to IVF Act and prevent access to fertility treatments from being 
swept up in all the dangerous rhetoric and legislation around embryos 
and personhood.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
  Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, instead of wasting time with messaging bills 
that have no chance of becoming law, Speaker Johnson and House 
Republicans should be taking steps that would actually solve problems 
for the American people. Please put the Right to IVF Act on the floor 
for a vote today, and vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we 
can protect Americans' right to build their families free from 
government interference.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell you a 
couple of the great things the National Defense Authorization Act does: 
14.5 percent pay raise for our junior enlisted, and a 4.5 percent pay 
raise for all other servicemembers. It fixes some of the cost of living 
and the basic needs allowances for our soldiers, and it authorizes an 
additional $954 million over the Pentagon's request for housing and 
facility maintenance accounts.
  It authorizes over $569 million to build new family housing units, 
$1.2 billion to renovate and build new barracks.
  It increases access to childcare, authorizes over $176 million for 
the design and construction of new childcare centers. It fully funds 
childcare fee assistance programs to eliminate all fee assistance wait-
lists for eligible families.
  Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of good things in this National Defense 
Authorization Act. It takes care of our military servicemen and -women, 
and it makes sure that we are safe.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), another distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee and my friend.
  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a rule that 
demonstrates much of what is wrong with the 118th Congress under this 
Republican majority, primarily a failure to do the people's business in 
a timely and serious manner.
  This rule has three bills. First, there is S. 4199, which addresses 
serious understaffing in our Federal courts, which impedes access to 
justice for all Americans. This carefully negotiated, bipartisan bill 
should have passed months ago, but it has been delayed in the House to 
seek partisan political advantage in the staffing of those new 
positions.
  Next, we have the Liberty in Laundry Act, part of the House 
Republican spin cycle to undermine energy efficiency standards for 
common household appliances. Like the companion bills that have been 
offered throughout this term, it would hamper the process of setting 
energy efficiency standards upon which consumers rely to save money and 
operate their homes more efficiently.

                              {time}  1300

  Finally, and most distressingly, this rule puts forward a politicized 
version of the National Defense Authorization Act. For 60 years, 
Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to draft the NDAA, coming 
together to put our troops, veterans, and national security above 
political considerations. The FY25 NDAA breaks from this tradition.
  I am deeply opposed to a provision in this NDAA that will prohibit 
the children of U.S. servicemembers from receiving medical treatment if 
they are diagnosed with gender dysphoria. This provision has no 
business being in an NDAA. At a time when we are struggling to recruit 
and retain soldiers, ensuring access to medical care for servicemembers 
and their families is more important than ever, but this bill, as 
written, will take away medically necessary care.
  The evidence is clear. Gender-affirming care of various types is 
life-changing and lifesaving for the children who need it. Our soldiers 
need to be able to focus on their missions, not worrying whether their 
children are able to get the medical treatment that they need.
  In order to illustrate the impact of this political attack, I would 
like to share the following story from a military spouse whose family 
would be harmed by this provision of the NDAA. They write:

       My spouse has proudly served in the U.S. Air Force for 22 
     years, dedicating their life to protecting our country. Over 
     the years, our family has moved across the Nation and the 
     world, embracing the challenges and opportunities that 
     military life brings.
       One of the greatest blessings of this life has been the 
     assurance of quality healthcare for our family. It has been a 
     cornerstone of our stability and a key reason why my spouse 
     continues to serve. Knowing we could depend on the military 
     healthcare system gave us the peace of mind to focus on the 
     sacrifices required of us as a military family.
       However, I am now writing to you with great concern and a 
     heavy heart. Recent legislative efforts to restrict or 
     eliminate access to gender-affirming care threaten not only 
     the well-being of my trans child but also the very values of 
     dignity and respect that our military stands for.
       This care has been transformative for my child, giving them 
     confidence, joy, and a sense of self that we had only 
     glimpsed before. To have this vital care stripped away feels 
     cruel and unjust. For lawmakers to target military families, 
     families who already sacrifice so much for this Nation, only 
     compounds the pain.
       My spouse has given 22 years to the service of this 
     country, and now it feels as though the country is turning 
     its back on us.

  I am thankful to this military family for sharing their story.
  The ability to obtain medical care for one's child, including gender-
affirming care, should be between a parent, a child, and their doctor, 
and politicians should stay the hell out of it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I oppose today's 
rule.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, again, as long as that 
treatment did not result in the sterilization of a child under the age 
of 18, then there is not a provision in this legislation that should be 
a problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
McCormick).

[[Page H6554]]

  

  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule 
providing for consideration of H.R. 7673, S. 4199, and H.R. 5009, the 
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025.
  I am confident that this year's NDAA will have a lasting, positive 
impact on our national security, and I urge my colleagues to support 
the rule providing for its consideration.
  The fiscal year 2025 NDAA authorizes targeted, responsible 
investments in critical technologies and future capabilities while 
restoring our military's focus on lethality.
  I served with sailors, marines, and Army folks from all walks of life 
during my time on Active Duty. We all bled red and were all green at 
heart, and we were all united in our mission to protect the United 
States.
  Putting our differences under the microscope only divides us and 
distracts us from our mission, so I am pleased that the NDAA gets 
things like DEI and critical race theory out of the military's divisive 
issues.
  I am also glad that it reauthorizes language I put in last year's 
NDAA to improve the Defense Department's transparency on how it works 
with entities that discriminate against conservative voices by steering 
advertisement dollars away from them.
  I was also proud to champion specific provisions in this bill that 
will help us deter and, if necessary, defeat our allies in the future 
fight. Things like using drones to clear land mines, changing how we do 
aircraft maintenance by using AI to bring down costs and improve 
readiness results, and making it easier for the Marine Corps to procure 
critical capabilities like LPDs and CH-53K helicopters will all help us 
maintain our edge over our adversaries using these techniques.
  Perhaps most importantly, the NDAA will drastically improve our 
servicemembers' quality of life, especially for the junior enlisted. 
The least we can do for our fellow Americans who take up the mantle of 
service is to make sure they have good housing, quality medical care, 
and the tools and resources to raise a family in the military if they 
so choose.
  This NDAA deters our adversaries, supports our allies, and exercises 
Congress' lawful oversight mandate to cut down on waste and improve the 
way our military does business within the private sector.
  Mr. Speaker, I express my sincerest thanks to Chairman Rogers, 
Ranking Member Smith, my fellow committee members, and all the staff 
for their work on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have helped with this bill, and I urge 
swift passage for the rule and swift passage of the fiscal year 2025 
NDAA.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of the 
gentlewoman if she has any additional speakers.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, indeed, I do have additional 
speakers.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Vermont (Ms. Balint).
  Ms. BALINT. Mr. Speaker, this is a message to all of my colleagues 
voting on the NDAA and to Americans who might be watching: You are 
being misled.
  Our most cynical Republican colleagues are telling you that Democrats 
are pushing for sterilization and surgery for kids in military 
families. Let me be absolutely clear: This is not true. That is not 
what is going on here.
  Here is what is true: TRICARE currently covers appropriate gender-
affirming hormone therapy for all military dependents, period, the kind 
of care that millions of doctors support as safe and effective.
  Now, Republicans want to restrict this, but only for trans kids. They 
are targeting trans kids and their families and saying what kind of 
healthcare is appropriate for them. This is a very tiny percentage of 
the population, and they are using this opportunity to scapegoat them.
  We know that appropriate and medically recommended care saves lives. 
We know this. It is well documented. Why wouldn't we want to do 
everything that we can to save the lives of children?
  I am a member of a military family. I was born on an Army base in 
Germany when my dad served in the military. Military families carry the 
weight of the world on their shoulders. They shouldn't have to worry 
whether their kids can receive the lifesaving care that they need.
  Our servicemembers have enough to worry about. Why do Republicans 
want to make it even more complicated for them by limiting healthcare 
options for their families?
  I am here to say it absolutely loud and clear: Military families 
deserve the healthcare that they need. This includes gender-affirming 
care options for their children.
  Servicemembers across this country and across the world deserve so 
much better than what they are getting from House Republicans.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, once again, I will read the 
provision word for word: ``Medical interventions for the treatment of 
gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization may not be provided 
to a child under the age of 18.'' That is word for word the language in 
the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, we have heard from my Democratic colleagues as we have 
raised our voices in opposition to this rule. We have raised our voices 
in opposition to this rule for numerous reasons.
  One is that it is not really taking care of the people's business, of 
their most pressing concerns--liberty and laundry, really?--when we 
could be addressing key things like funding the government, protecting 
Social Security, passing the farm bill, and making sure that we have 
the nutrition programs so children do not go to school hungry and stay 
hungry.
  We need to protect education. We need to do all of these things that 
the American people are asking for, and what do we get instead? We get 
their bills for liberty and laundry.
  This is a continuation of their other bills, you know, stoves, 
refrigerators, all kinds of things that mean nothing to the American 
people but that mean a lot to those big corporations and those 
billionaires.
  Time and time again, Republicans have come to this floor and told us 
who they stand with. They stand with the richest Americans. They stand 
with the billionaires. They stand with the wealthy corporations who do 
not want any regulation.
  When they say no regulation, what they are saying is don't pass the 
kinds of regulations that save lives, don't pass the kinds of 
regulations that make sure that we save money. That is when we will 
constantly point out every time they do it: Who are you standing with? 
The wealthiest, the billionaires.
  We are standing with working families.
  Then, we have the NDAA, something that is usually and almost always 
bipartisan. You do not hear the ranking member of the Armed Services 
Committee come before the committee and describe how these kinds of 
provisions are poison pills, how they are a stain on bipartisanship.

  My colleague across the aisle keeps getting up and pointing out one 
provision, but that provision fails to acknowledge that the lack of 
care leads to death, leads to suicide. You are standing in between a 
father, a mother, and their child. You are standing in between the 
parents, the doctors, and their child.
  I think that Americans deserve more. We deserve American families, 
especially those who, as the story from the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) said, have sacrificed so much for our 
Nation, who go and travel from one base to another base to another base 
knowing they can get care for their children.
  Members on the other side say: No, no, no, we know better than you. 
We know better than the parent and the doctor as to what care your 
child should get.
  That is insulting to our marines, to those who serve in our Navy, to 
those who are deployed overseas and on our bases around our own 
country. They deserve better.
  That is why we are calling out that provision, because it interferes 
with a

[[Page H6555]]

family's ability to get care for their children. Because of these 
tragic problems and the fact that you don't let us debate anything--all 
those amendments that were offered, no, we never get to debate any of 
those, so the American people don't know. They can't hear us talk about 
these things. This is one of the only times we get to come to talk 
about these things.
  For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I think every American knows that when agencies pass 
rules and regulations just for the sake of passing rules and 
regulations, those rules and regulations increase the costs of consumer 
goods. It doesn't hurt the billionaire. It hurts the working Americans.
  This week, we have the ability to advance significant legislation in 
the House of Representatives. In fiscal year 2025, the National Defense 
Authorization Act fully authorizes our national defense and improves 
efficiency while eliminating wasteful spending and harmful programs.

                              {time}  1315

  Mr. Speaker, it strengthens our military and takes important steps to 
address the security threats Americans face from our adversaries 
including China, Iran, and foreign terrorist organizations.
  It improves our military readiness, provides robust support to our 
ally, Israel, and supports law enforcement operations at our southern 
border.
  Critically, Mr. Speaker, it focuses on improving the quality of life 
of our servicemembers and their families who sacrifice so much to 
defend us. This NDAA provides a 14.5 percent pay raise for our junior 
enlisted servicemembers and a 4.5 percent pay raise for all other 
servicemembers.
  The NDAA has been enacted into law every year for 63 years, and I 
encourage all Members to do what is best for our military and national 
security and support this legislation.
  Additionally, H.R. 7673, the Liberty in Laundry Act, pushes back on 
executive overreach that is increasing the costs of appliances and 
diminishing their quality.
  Again, H.R. 7673 clarifies the intent of the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act by prohibiting the Secretary of Energy from imposing 
new efficiency mandates or enforcing existing standards for washing 
machines, unless they are cost effective and technologically feasible, 
not likely to result in any additional costs to Americans, and save a 
significant amount of energy.
  Again, passing additional rules and regulations that increase the 
cost of people's appliances doesn't matter to the billionaire. It does 
matter to the working American.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill which supports 
energy efficiency standards. As long as the technology exists to meet 
them, they don't take more money out of the pockets of hardworking 
Americans, and they actually save energy.
  Finally, S. 4199, the JUDGES Act of 2024, adds 66 judgeships over 
three different Presidential terms. It fairly works to address the 
workload demands in our courts. I call on my colleagues to join me in 
voting ``yes'' on the previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge on my colleagues to support this legislation 
which passed out of the Senate unanimously.
  The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as 
follows:

     The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order 
     against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous 
     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
     any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening 
     motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and 
     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
     Committee on Energy and Commerce or their respective 
     designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.
       Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the 
     consideration of H.R. 9643.
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous 
question.

                         LIBERTY IN LAUNDRY ACT

  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1612, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 7673) to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from 
prescribing or enforcing energy conservation standards for clothes 
washers that are not cost-effective or technologically feasible, and 
for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the 
House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Molinaro). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1612, the bill is considered read.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7673

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Liberty in Laundry Act''.

     SEC. 2. PRESCRIBING AND ENFORCING ENERGY CONSERVATION 
                   STANDARDS FOR CLOTHES WASHERS.

       (a) Technologically Feasible and Economically Justified.--
     Notwithstanding subsections (m), (n), and (o) of section 325 
     of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295), 
     the Secretary of Energy may not--
       (1) prescribe a new or an amended energy conservation 
     standard for a covered product that is a clothes washer under 
     such section unless the Secretary of Energy determines that 
     the prescription and imposition of such energy conservation 
     standard is technologically feasible and economically 
     justified; or
       (2) enforce an energy conservation standard prescribed 
     under such section for a covered product that is a clothes 
     washer if the Secretary of Energy determines that enforcement 
     of or compliance with such energy conservation standard is 
     not technologically feasible or economically justified.
       (b) Prohibition on Increased Costs to Consumers.--
     Notwithstanding subsections (m), (n), and (o) of section 325 
     of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295), 
     the Secretary of Energy may not--
       (1) prescribe a new or an amended energy conservation 
     standard for a covered product that is a clothes washer under 
     such section unless the Secretary of Energy determines that 
     the prescription and imposition of such energy conservation 
     standard is not likely to result in additional net costs to 
     the consumer, including any increase in net costs associated 
     with the purchase, installation, maintenance, disposal, and 
     replacement of the covered product; or
       (2) enforce an energy conservation standard prescribed 
     under such section for a covered product that is a clothes 
     washer if the Secretary of Energy determines that enforcement 
     of or compliance with such energy conservation standard is 
     likely to result in additional net costs to the consumer, 
     including any increase in net costs associated with the 
     purchase, installation, maintenance, disposal, and 
     replacement of the covered product.
       (c) Significant Energy Savings Requirement.--
     Notwithstanding subsections (m), (n), and (o) of section 325 
     of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295), 
     the Secretary of Energy may not--
       (1) prescribe a new or an amended energy conservation 
     standard for a covered product that is a clothes washer under 
     such section if the Secretary of Energy determines that the 
     prescription and imposition of such energy conservation 
     standard will not result in significant conservation of 
     energy; or
       (2) enforce an energy conservation standard prescribed 
     under such section for a covered product that is a clothes 
     washer if the Secretary of Energy determines that enforcement 
     of or compliance with such energy conservation standard will 
     not result in significant conservation of energy.
       (d) Covered Product; Energy Conservation Standard.--In this 
     section, the terms ``covered product'' and ``energy 
     conservation standard'' have the meanings given such terms in 
     section 321 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
     U.S.C. 6291).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and

[[Page H6559]]

ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or 
their respective designees.
  The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) and the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).


                             General Leave

  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 7673.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7673, the Liberty in 
Laundry Act, and I thank Congressman Ogles for leading on this issue.
  Throughout the 118th Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee has 
been on the front lines for defending the needs of everyday Americans 
against the radical climate agenda of the Biden administration.
  This administration has prioritized expensive and unreliable energy 
policies that have diminished the quality of life for our friends and 
neighbors across the country.
  These harmful policies have sought to direct the energy we use and 
even the appliances we buy. We stood on this floor and we talked about 
gas stoves, dishwashers, and HVACs. In Congress, we talked about the 
push to electrification and the mandates from the U.S. Government to 
Americans to tell them what kind of cars they have to drive--not what 
they want to drive, but cars they have to drive. Today, we are 
addressing the assault on clothes washers.
  This bill protects the affordability and quality and choice for 
Americans to decide for themselves what suits their needs best.
  Thanks to radical climate policies, Americans will spend 34 percent 
more on appliances today than they did just a decade ago. These 
appliances are not only more expensive, they offer a lesser quality 
with fewer features Americans rely on and shorter lifespans.
  This legislation will prevent the DOE from enforcing standards for 
clothes washers unless they are technologically feasible and 
economically justified, are not likely to result in additional cost to 
the consumer, and will result in significant conservation of energy.
  The American people have spoken. They cannot afford and they don't 
want more of the same. They have overwhelmingly rejected the Democratic 
Party and their pandering to the radical climate lobby.
  Everyday Americans are tired of record inflation, high-energy costs, 
and just the struggle they have every day to make ends meet.

                              {time}  1430

  This legislation addresses kitchen-table issues for Americans and 
their families. The out-of-touch policies of the Biden administration 
are why the American people decided to elect President Donald J. Trump 
to a second term.
  In the 119th Congress, House Republicans will continue to fight for 
hardworking Americans and unleash our energy to lower costs and improve 
the quality of life for those across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 7673, 
the Liberty in Laundry Act. I thank Representative Ogles for leading 
this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, we are quickly approaching the final days of this 
Congress, and after spending a year on the campaign trail promising to 
lower prices for working families, today House Republicans are bringing 
up a bill that will raise energy bills for those very same families.
  H.R. 7673 guts popular energy efficiency standards for laundry 
machines, standards that save Americans money on their utility bills 
and reduce dangerous greenhouse gas pollution at the same time.
  These efficiency standards create certainty for manufacturers, and 
they protect consumers from rising costs. In the case of these laundry 
machine standards, they also reduce water use, a benefit that could 
greatly aid drought-prone regions around the Nation.
  What is more, Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's energy 
efficiency actions are projected to save Americans $1 trillion and 
reduce greenhouse gas pollution by more than 2.5 billion metric tons 
over the next 30 years. The laundry machine standard that this bill 
guts is on track to save Americans $18 billion on their utility bills 
over the next 30 years, as well.
  However, today's Republican Party is unpersuaded by things like facts 
and cost savings. With this bill, Republicans are proving that their 
vow to lower costs was nothing more than an empty campaign promise. 
This legislation actively works to raise Americans' energy bills, all 
so they can curry favor with their special interest friends and do the 
bidding of their fossil fuel industry friends. Absolutely no one else 
stands to benefit from this legislation, proving once and for all that 
Republicans only pay lip service to lowering costs when it is campaign 
season.
  That is why this bill conveniently ignores the efficiency standards-
setting process that already exists at the Department of Energy, which 
already requires that these standards result in significant savings, be 
technologically feasible, and economically justifiable.
  In fact, DOE's process works so well that the laundry machine 
standard targeted by this bill was actually the result of a consensus 
agreement between the appliance industry, efficiency advocates, and 
consumer advocates. They actually embrace reality. The reality is that 
laundry machine standards haven't been updated in more than a decade, 
many models that meet the new standard already exist, and appliance 
manufacturers have said they do not feel burdened by it at all.
  All this begs the question--why are Republicans trying to undermine a 
process that brings everyone to the table to lower costs? Who, exactly, 
is asking for this bill?
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7673 would effectively overturn the Department of 
Energy's recently finalized efficiency standards and prohibit the 
Department from enforcing any standard that increases upfront costs by 
even a single penny, completely ignoring the massive savings that 
Americans would enjoy on their home energy bills over the long run.
  I oppose the bill because it will increase energy costs for American 
families and undermine our ongoing efforts to combat the worsening 
climate crisis. Republicans will go out of their way to cut taxes for 
their wealthy billionaire friends, but when it comes to taking actions 
that actually lower costs for everyday Americans, they are nowhere to 
be found.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I remind Americans that this mandate by the Biden administration on 
washing machines will only save them about $9 total over the lifespan 
of the unit itself, which is about 13\1/2\ years, a savings of only $9 
over 13\1/2\ years. Unbelievable.
  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. Ogles), my friend.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Liberty in 
Laundry Act, which defends the American people against rogue and out-
of-touch D.C. bureaucrats.
  There might only be 41 days remaining in the current administration, 
but this administration is still doing its best to make household 
appliances unaffordable. If he wanted to limit consumer choice, 
undercut quality, and raise costs for Americans, then Joe Biden 
couldn't have done a better job.
  First it was gas stoves, then it was water heaters and HVAC. Go down 
the list. Now the Biden-Harris administration is going after your 
washing machines.
  When the government tries to micromanage something as basic as your 
laundry routine, including which washing machines you can buy and how 
much you will pay for them, my Republican colleagues and I will take a 
stand.
  The Biden Energy Department doesn't even believe in the value of its

[[Page H6560]]

own rulemaking. As the chairman said, $9 over the lifespan of this 
device. The upfront cost of the machine is outweighed by this so-called 
savings.
  They are imposing energy standards that often mean higher costs on 
the appliances themselves, longer wash cycles, and perhaps even using 
more water. The American people pay more for their appliances upfront 
because of these efficiency standards.
  Worse, the Biden administration repealed better efficiency rules 
implemented by the Trump administration with the Fifth Circuit ruling 
earlier this year that DOE's repeal of President Trump's efficiency 
rules were arbitrary and capricious.

  The court found that the Biden administration failed to consider--now 
keep in mind, this is the court--failed to consider things like 
appliance performance and the fact that the standards were causing 
Americans to use more water, not less.
  Some Democrats may want to race down the world to serfdom, replacing 
the judgments of consumers with those of government commissars about 
what products best meet their needs. However, I will not allow them to 
drag millions of hardworking Americans, like in the rural parts of my 
district, who are going to go to their appliance store and pay more.
  My bill prohibits the Department of Energy from imposing or enforcing 
standards that would increase net costs to consumers. My bill requires 
them to include costs related to purchase, installation, maintenance, 
and replacement cost, forcing them to be honest about the true cost of 
the rule or the regulation.
  My bill safeguards the right of families to choose the appliance that 
best fits their needs and budget, again, without the burden of the 
Biden administration.
  Of course, we won't stop with laundry. We will continue pursuing 
legislation to stop bureaucrats wherever they choose to make life 
harder for hardworking Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my legislation.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), the ranking member of the 
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 
7673. It is a Republican bill that is going to raise costs on American 
families.
  Mr. Speaker, years ago, Congress directed the Department of Energy to 
encourage innovation and cost savings in the appliances we use by 
working with manufacturers and consumer advocates to routinely update 
energy efficiency standards. That is one of the reasons why Americans 
enjoy modern and cost-saving appliances when they go to replace them.
  Everyone knows that higher standards do not force you to go and 
replace your washing machine, but when that washer finally breaks, you 
have the choice to replace it with a better model, one that saves you 
money.
  Energy efficiency across all appliances is a huge success. It helps 
families save money and improves our lives.
  Earlier this year, the Department of Energy updated standards for 
clothes washers based upon the input of a wide range of stakeholders, 
including the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers--that is 
right, the manufacturers support energy efficiency standards--the 
Consumer Federation of America, and energy efficiency advocates. To 
them, I say great work and thank you because over time Americans will 
save big on their energy and water bills while also reducing tons of 
dangerous carbon dioxide pollution.
  You could say that energy-efficient clothes washers will provide 
loads of savings, as the new models speed up the cycle to aid the 
household bottom line.
  All together, with more efficient appliances, DOE projects that the 
average family could save at least $100 a year on their utility bills, 
plus efficiency helps cut the pollution that is fueling costly extreme 
weather events like Hurricanes Helene and Milton that ruined homes and 
businesses back in my community just a few months ago.
  If the appliance industry supports efficiency standards and consumer 
groups support efficiency standards, and three out of five Americans 
support the cost savings, why are Republicans making this a priority? 
Well, here is the dirty, little secret. The special interests that 
profit off of people using as much energy as possible and who profit 
when energy is wasted--like oil and gas companies and some utilities--
have a lot of influence here on Capitol Hill.
  You can either side with the polluters and their profits or you can 
side with the people and their pocketbooks. I am going to side with the 
people and their pocketbooks every time.
  Appliance efficiency standards are one of the best tools we have to 
lower household energy costs, so I urge my colleagues not to fall for 
the rinse and spin, put this bill out to dry, and vote ``no.''
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 
partisan energy appliance bill. Time and time again in this Congress, 
we keep seeing these bills brought to the floor that are partisan 
messaging bills meant to rile up the American people, not really get 
something done, while continuing to put off the work that the American 
people sent us here to do.

  H.R. 7673 isn't the first anti-efficiency bill we have seen on the 
House floor this year. I say to my Republican colleagues and friends, I 
am not sure what we are really getting done. The Liberty in Laundry 
Act, along with other anti-efficiency bills this Congress, would delay 
and weaken popular energy efficiency standards, courting favor with 
polluters, not consumers.
  The bill attacks existing standards and sends a message to the 
incoming Trump administration to attack existing standards and 
undermine the entire program. Bills like the Liberty in Laundry Act 
show that Republicans don't want to help save American consumers money 
on their energy bills.
  I wish we could work together on doing things that the American 
people need us to do instead of going after America's household 
appliances. The fear-mongering continues, and it is nothing more than 
politics designed to scare consumers.
  I am a car girl. Hey, I am not old, but I am seasoned. When the 
administration, Republicans and Democrats, wanted to increase fuel 
efficiency standards, American consumers wanted it, and yet on the 
floor of both houses, people stood up against it. I will tell you what, 
the American consumer likes those fuel efficiency standards. It saved 
them money.
  The American people sent us here to work together in a bipartisan 
manner to find commonsense solutions, and that is what I want to work 
with my colleagues on, but we don't have much time left in this 
Congress, so I am just saying, can we please work together on the real 
issues facing the American people instead of talking about people's 
dirty laundry?
  Let me say again, we are politicizing washing machines. Why? We have 
real work to do to cut costs and make life better for Americans. We 
need to fund the government. Attacking popular energy efficiency 
standards is not why our constituents sent us here. They want us to 
save them money.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 7673. We need 
to work on things that will make a difference for consumers every day 
in the remaining days of the 118th Congress.

                              {time}  1445

  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, just a point. The payback periods for many 
of these appliances are uneconomical. Republicans look long term. 
Republicans look toward quality and value for Americans.
  For example, the payback period for the Department of Energy's 
proposed clothes washer standard for a ventless electric combination 
washer and dryer is--are you ready for it?--46 years. Forty-six years 
for a washing machine that, if we are lucky, will last 15 years. 
Americans know they have to replace a lot of appliances over a period 
of time.
  Mr. Speaker, it is sort of a bittersweet moment for me because this 
may be the very last time I get to speak from the House floor, and it 
is an honor to be here to represent the Energy and Commerce Committee's 
Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee

[[Page H6561]]

that I chair on this bill, but it has been an honor to work on so many 
other bills over time.
  I have enjoyed working with my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. Ranking Member Pallone has been a phenomenal ranking member for 
the Energy and Commerce Committee to work with. I have enjoyed it. 
There are so many others on the other side of the aisle, too many to 
name, but Representative Henry Cuellar is a good friend and Scott 
Peters. Albio Sires was a good friend of mine who is no longer in 
Congress.
  It has been an interesting ride for 14 years in the United States 
Congress. I have seen a lot on this House floor, from last year with 
the Speaker's debate from the original Speaker election that happened 
in this Congress back to John Boehner, Speaker Boehner, calling me a 
hardhead on the floor, something I wore as a badge of courage because I 
was representing my constituents in the Third District of South 
Carolina, who sent me to Washington to be that hardhead because they 
were tired of seeing runaway government. They were tired of seeing 
government spending that has created a balance of about $35 trillion in 
debt that our Nation faces today. That is a number that is 
unfathomable.
  To work on energy policy has been something that I came to Washington 
to work on, and I was blessed with the opportunity to become the chair 
of the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee. We dealt with 
energy, grid security, and climate change in this Congress--retitled 
that committee--but we focus a lot on American energy, American energy 
independence.
  There are four words that I talk about often. Those are produce, 
deliver, utilize, and export. We are blessed in this Nation with 
abundant resources that we need to produce more of because using 
natural gas, as an example, we have in abundance. We can't even measure 
the amount of natural gas we are blessed with in this Nation, and 
utilizing that natural gas has helped us lower our global carbon 
emissions.
  The carbon emissions in the United States have gone down because of 
the use of cleaner-burning, American-produced natural gas. If we 
produce more, we are going to need to deliver those assets whether it 
is liquid fuels or gas or electricity down power lines, transmission 
lines. That is the delivery component.
  We have to deliver that resource, whether it is electricity produced 
at a nuclear power plant or whether it is natural gas or liquid fuels 
going to the refinery. We need to produce more. We need to deliver it 
to where it can be utilized.
  We need to utilize it to create the electricity that meets the 
demands of America and the globe, and energy demand in this country and 
globally is not going down. It is only going up, and it is going up 
exponentially globally. We can help so many people around the world 
improve their quality of life, their standard of living, by exporting 
more United States-produced natural gas to help them meet their global 
carbon emissions goals by utilizing cleaner burning U.S. gas, taking 
their coal-fired power plants offline and using U.S. gas to produce the 
electricity that makes the lives of their constituents and their 
citizens much better.
  These are things we have worked on, and I hope Congress in the future 
will continue to work on, yes, lowering our global carbon emissions 
because, yes, cleaner air is just the right thing. Whatever side you 
come down on on the global climate change aspects, cleaner air is good, 
and we can do that by utilizing more U.S.-produced natural gas.
  Produce more, deliver more, utilize more, and export more to help our 
friends and allies in Eastern Europe that are facing energy security 
issues because they depend on Russia. They look west to the U.S. to 
help them meet their energy needs.
  Yet, we debate things like washing machines, stoves, and dishwashers, 
but we have had the opportunity to work on real substantive issues for 
American energy policy under my tenure as an Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee chair, but also under Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a great 
American who chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee for this 
Congress. She has been a great leader. She also is somebody who cares 
about more than just energy. She cares about the whole spectrum of 
energy and commerce, from children's online safety to privacy, data 
privacy. She also understands the need for American energy 
independence.
  I have been blessed with the opportunity in Congress to stand here, 
and I give a shout-out to Representative Doc Hastings, who was the 
former chair of the Natural Resources Committee who gave me the 
opportunity twice back in the day when we actually did motions to 
recommit and had those speeches. Ranking Member Pallone may remember 
those days. Honestly, that was some of the most fun debate on the House 
floor. You heard cheers. Trey Gowdy was up here, and others. I miss 
those days in the United States Congress when we interacted a little 
bit more.
  I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee staff that is sitting 
behind me and the full committee staff that has made this job much 
easier, providing us the information we need to debate properly.
  This is a great institution that I have been honored to be a part of. 
I thank the House staff because they are great. They make order out of 
all this chaos. It is chaos many, many days, but we are all here 
elected, both Republican and Democrat, to do what is best for the 
United States of America, a country that we love, every one of us.

  We may have differences on how to get there, but making America 
great, being the best nation we can be, providing for our constituents, 
providing for our Nation, being a strong nation, is something everybody 
believes in. We just have different approaches. Nobody dislikes one 
another, and that is what really makes the United States House of 
Representatives so special.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this 
today on the floor. I thank my creator for giving me the opportunity to 
do this.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Duncan for all that he has done for many 
years in Congress, particularly on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
We were at the Rules Committee last night, and we actually said that we 
enjoyed being at the Rules Committee and sparring back and forth. I 
think we really meant it. Not too many people would say that when they 
go to the Rules Committee, to be perfectly honest. That is because he 
has always been a gentleman. He is always concerned about doing the 
right thing.
  One of the things in the Energy and Commerce Committee that we do all 
the time is try to come to a consensus. It is not always possible. That 
is certainly not possible on this bill, but we really try to get things 
done. We try to build a consensus and do what we think is going to make 
a difference to improve the lives of the American people. I thank him 
for the comments he made and for his service, and I know we are going 
to see each other after this year as well, hopefully a lot.
  Mr. Speaker, maybe this bill is a good example of what I just said. I 
understand where the Republicans are coming from, but I just strongly 
disagree, frankly, because I think for many years now the Department of 
Energy has had the obligation to try to come up with better efficiency 
standards for appliances. Usually, it is done on a consensus basis with 
industry, and it has to, under the current law, save money.
  In this case, it is not only saving money over the life of a washing 
machine, if you will, but also saving water, reducing the amount of 
greenhouse gases that go into the atmosphere. I think the one thing 
where we differ is Mr. Duncan has talked about maybe--I don't want to 
put words in his mouth--the price goes up a dollar or a few dollars 
from where it is right now, but over the life of a machine, you 
actually are saving money. That is exactly what the Department is 
supposed to look at when they look at not only the energy savings but 
the reduced costs to the consumer. That is maybe where the difference 
lies here.
  The bottom line is that this standard doesn't go into effect until 
2028. It certainly is my experience--and you know they have done focus 
groups and other things on this to show that people actually want more 
efficient machines

[[Page H6562]]

and the new technology that goes with it.
  I think it really makes no sense to simply say we are going to wipe 
away these efficiency standards for laundry machines. We have had 
similar bills on refrigerators and other appliances because what we are 
all about in this country is using technology to make things more 
efficient, make things cheaper, and make things better for the future.
  That is essentially why I oppose the bill and would ask my colleagues 
to vote ``no'' on this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think the difference between the 
Republican Party and administration and Democrats comes down to 
government mandating certain choices and Republicans believing in free 
markets, market choices, and market opportunities.
  If Americans want to buy something that, in their mind, is more 
efficient and that can save them money, maybe will last longer, that is 
up to the Americans. The market will step up and provide those 
opportunities and products. If you want an electric vehicle, the market 
is going to provide that. It shouldn't be mandated.
  I thank my colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) for approaching this 
bill that is dealing with washing machines, but the broader picture is 
the mandates from the administration to tell Americans the only choices 
they have aren't going to save them that much money in the long run, as 
we pointed out.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to 
recommit and vote in favor of this legislation, H.R. 7673.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1612, the previous question is ordered 
on the bill.
  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed.

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 9769.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9769. As we have all witnessed 
in recent weeks, foreign malicious cyber actors are continuously 
attempting to infiltrate IT environments in a wide range of U.S. 
critical infrastructure sectors.
  The DHS Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored 
Threats Act will establish an interagency task force chaired by the 
Director of CISA to address the cybersecurity threats posed by PRC 
cyber actors, including Volt Typhoon.
  I commend my colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lee), for 
her leadership in confronting these threats. I am proud to have joined 
her in introducing this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, our adversaries are growing bolder and more 
sophisticated in using cyber tools to gain access to government and 
critical infrastructure networks. As we speak, the Federal Government 
and its private-sector partners are working to understand the full 
scope and scale of the telecommunications hack by state-sponsored 
threat actors from China, known as Salt Typhoon.
  The Salt Typhoon telecom hack followed warnings issued earlier this 
year by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its 
Federal partners that state-sponsored threat actors from China are 
``seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or 
destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure.''
  H.R. 9769, the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored 
Threats Act, formalizes interagency efforts already underway to defend 
against state-sponsored threat activity directed by the People's 
Republic of China.
  Notably, it would establish an interagency task force and a reporting 
requirement to ensure Congress is informed of sector-specific cyber 
threat trends and additional resources or authorities the government 
needs to protect government and critical infrastructure networks, among 
other things.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 9769, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lee).

[[Page H6564]]

  

  Ms. LEE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party and 
other adversary nation-states and criminal networks have been 
exploiting our critical infrastructure and collecting information on 
American officials, posing a grave threat to our national security.
  The malicious cyber activity by the CCP represents a calculated 
effort to gather intelligence on IT systems vital to U.S. national 
security, public safety, and economic stability.
  Specifically, the CCP state-sponsored cyber actor known as Volt 
Typhoon has conducted a coordinated campaign to infiltrate the 
information technology environments of a wide range of critical 
infrastructure sectors of the United States, including sectors like 
communications, transportation, energy, and water.
  H.R. 9769, the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored 
Threats Act, will create an interagency task force, chaired by the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, Director and 
co-chaired by the FBI Director to address the cybersecurity threat 
posed by CCP cyber actors.
  This bill would improve our defensive and offensive capabilities in 
cyberspace and requires the task force to provide a classified report 
and briefing to Congress annually for 5 years on their findings, 
conclusions, and recommendations relating to malicious cyber activity. 
Specifically, this task force will help Congress create a mitigation 
strategy every year to help us prevent future cyberattacks and protect 
our national security.
  It is time to mitigate this threat and secure our networks and 
infrastructure to protect all Americans. We must address the grave 
threats China and other foreign adversaries pose to our cybersecurity. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 9769.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 9769, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 9769, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9769.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

``Sec. 1334. Cybersecurity internship program.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.


                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 9689.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9689, the DHS Cybersecurity 
Internship Program Act.
  I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), for 
her work on this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, according to testimony before the House Committee on 
Homeland Security earlier this year, there are approximately 2,000 
cybersecurity vacancies at the Department of Homeland Security. Recent 
cyber intrusions like the Salt Typhoon telecom breach demonstrate the 
urgent need to fill those empty desks.
  That is why I have introduced H.R. 9689, the DHS Cybersecurity 
Internship Program Act. This bill codifies DHS' cyber internship 
program, helping ensure DHS continues to expand its efforts to support 
individuals seeking to join the cyber workforce.

[[Page H6565]]

  Internships are particularly valuable for building the workforce 
because they help build the connection from school to work. For 
students, they provide critical work experience that can help launch 
their careers with the practical skills they will need in the 
workforce. For the Department, internships can help support the cyber 
mission while building a pipeline to future employment at DHS.
  Importantly, these internships are paid, ensuring the program is 
accessible to all. This summer, 85 interns participated in DHS' new 
cyber internship program.
  Enacting this legislation will ensure that DHS continues the program 
while adding new oversight requirements to keep Congress informed on 
how the Department is recruiting interns and utilizing the program to 
support its cyber mission.
  Additionally, my legislation directs the Department to meet cyber 
talent where it is, whether in high school, community and 4-year 
colleges, technical schools, or graduate school. Recruiting cyber 
talent from a broad range of educational institutions will result in a 
bigger pool of applicants and reflect best practices that more 
employers should implement.
  I thank Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee 
Chairman Garbarino for cosponsoring this bill and my colleagues on the 
House Committee on Homeland Security for supporting it at our markup in 
September. I look forward to similar bipartisan support in the full 
House.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, the DHS Cybersecurity Internship 
Program Act will advance our shared goal of strengthening the American 
cyber workforce while supporting DHS' effort to recruit the next 
generation of cyber talent and to defend the homeland.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 9689, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 9689, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9689.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.


                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6229.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6229, the DHS Special Events 
Program and Support Act. I thank the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
Titus) for bringing this measure forward.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6229, the DHS Special Events 
Program and Support Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
Titus).
  H.R. 6229 is a bipartisan bill that would make our communities safer 
during large public events and mass gatherings by ensuring that our 
State,

[[Page H6566]]

local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement have access to tools, 
resources, and help from the Department of Homeland Security.
  We all know that the United States holds some of the world's greatest 
events, from professional football games to Formula One races, rodeos, 
State fairs, NASCAR, and so on. Every one of these events, big or 
small, requires security planning and management by State, local, 
Tribal, and territorial officials. Good planning and management are 
what it takes to prevent threats at mass gatherings and public events 
and, in the event of any danger, respond quickly and effectively.
  H.R. 6229 is an opportunity for Congress to provide our communities 
with planning and management resources by authorizing the Special Event 
Assessment Rating program, known as the SEAR program, within DHS.
  The SEAR program has had great success in every one of the States we 
represent, helping us ensure safe and enjoyable experiences at home 
events, big and small.
  What SEAR does is measure the risk of a terrorist attack or other 
hazards, as appropriate, on a special event. Events are submitted to 
DHS by a State, local, Tribal, or territorial partner for an 
assessment.
  Under the bill, DHS may provide security coordination and protection 
support for events with the most serious ratings.
  Earlier this year in a hearing during National Police Week, former 
Atlanta Chief of Police Rodney Bryant told the House Committee on 
Homeland Security that the SEAR program and DHS resources helped him 
ensure a safe experience for Americans attending the Super Bowl and 
college football playoff championship.
  Looking forward, our communities are going to need even more help 
from DHS through the SEAR program. In addition to longstanding large-
scale public events like NFL games or New Year's celebrations in Times 
Square, the United States has a robust and growing presence on the 
Formula One racing circuit, and in just 2 years, we will be host to the 
World Cup.

                              {time}  1515

  DHS recently informed Congress that the World Cup matches across the 
country in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, 
Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and New Jersey 
are SEAR rated and will need Federal help to secure their global soccer 
matches.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time we authorize this critical program and ensure 
that these social, sporting, and other events can be enjoyed freely, 
safely, and without fear.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
Titus), the author of the bill.
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6229, the DHS 
Special Events Program and Support Act.
  Nevada's First District, that I am proud to represent, hosts hundreds 
of high-profile events each year that require considerable security 
measures to keep safe the southern Nevadans and the thousands of 
visitors who attend these events.
  While State and local law enforcement take the primary responsibility 
in providing support for local events, many occasions, from the Super 
Bowl to Formula One races, require additional Federal support to ensure 
that security measures are hardened to prevent and protect against bad 
actors intending to do harm.
  Through October of this year, about 35 million visitors have come to 
Las Vegas. This includes 5 million who came for conventions, 330,000 
who attended the Super Bowl, and 300,000 who were there recently for 
Formula One.
  Major events like this don't just occur in my district. They occur 
all around the country. Our country hosts some of the world's greatest 
events, as you have heard. In communities across the United States, 
special events routinely draw visitors from around the country and 
around the world, necessitating large-scale security coordination and 
assistance from the Federal Government.
  Our next decade will be crucial for the United States as we host 
several large-scale events that will draw millions of visitors. These 
will require enhanced security coordination. They include the World 
Cup, the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, Men's and Women's Rugby 
World Cup, and the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, that in 
addition will give our country the opportunity to show off to the rest 
of the world that we are the unparalleled sports, entertainment, and 
hospitality capital.
  My bill, H.R. 6229, the DHS Special Events Program and Support Act, 
will enable the Federal Government to support these local jurisdictions 
in safely hosting these events.
  The SEAR program within DHS helps to provide this supplemental 
Federal support on an ad hoc basis, but it has never been authorized 
into law. This legislation does just that and in turn fortifies the 
existing program to better equip law enforcement authorities to 
prevent, mitigate, and respond to threats to events that happen in all 
our districts.
  Importantly, it codifies the standardized SEAR process into law, 
ensures DHS maintains its risk-based methodology for event review, and 
allows expedited consideration or reconsideration of events that 
receive an initial SEAR designation.
  I thank Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina for 
partnering with me on this legislation to codify the SEAR program, as 
well as Representatives  Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Anthony 
D'Esposito of New York, and Jared Moskowitz of Florida for cosponsoring 
the bill. I thank the chairman and ranking member for bringing it to 
the floor, and I urge all Members to vote in support of this bipartisan 
measure.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time for closing.
  Mr. Speaker, authorizing SEAR's great work will ensure that DHS may 
continue providing risk assessments and support to certain preplanned 
special events across the United States.
  I thank Representatives Titus of Nevada and Hudson of North Carolina 
for introducing this bill, which will strengthen Homeland Security and 
protect our greatest community events from terrorism or other security 
threats.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6229, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6229, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules

            VETERANS EXPEDITED TSA SCREENING SAFE TRAVEL ACT

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (H.R. 7365) to provide PreCheck to certain severely 
injured or disabled veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 7365

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Expedited TSA 
     Screening Safe Travel Act'' or the ``VETS Safe Travel Act''.

     SEC. 2. AVAILABILITY OF PRECHECK PROGRAM TO CERTAIN SEVERELY 
                   INJURED OR DISABLED VETERANS.

       (a) In General.--Section 44927 of title 49, United States 
     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(g) Availability of PreCheck Program to Certain Severely 
     Injured or Disabled Veterans.--
       ``(1) In general.--A veteran described in paragraph (2) is 
     eligible for security screening under the PreCheck Program

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Green) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.


                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 7365.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7365, the VETS Safe 
Travel Act. The bill would make the Transportation Security 
Administration's PreCheck program available to certain disabled 
veterans. It is an important piece of legislation, and I thank the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) for his attention to this matter.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, during this era of partisanship and discord, there is 
one issue on which I hope we can all agree: that veterans who are 
disabled while serving our country should be provided the utmost care 
and respect.
  Unfortunately, our current airport security screening systems cause 
unnecessary delays and intrusions for many disabled veterans.
  The VETS Safe Travel Act, H.R. 7365, would help address these 
challenges by allowing veterans with service-connected disabilities and 
severe injuries to enroll in the Transportation Security 
Administration's PreCheck expedited screening program at no cost to the 
veteran.
  Doing so will allow disabled veterans to move through airport 
screening quickly and with minimal hassle.
  Importantly, such veterans will still be required to undergo the 
background checks required for all passengers enrolling in the PreCheck 
program, thus maintaining the integrity and security of the program.
  In addition, during committee consideration of this bill, Democrats 
offered an amendment that would ensure the bill does not 
unintentionally require TSA to increase PreCheck enrollment fees for 
all other passengers to pay for the enrollments of disabled veterans.
  By passing this bill, Congress will improve everyday life for 
disabled veterans as they travel.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).
  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Green for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, my great State of Arizona is home to over 450,000 
veterans, and nearly 30 percent of those veterans live with a 
disability.
  My legislation, H.R. 7365, the Veterans Expedited TSA Screening, or 
VETS, Safe Travel Act, will provide optimized security screenings to 
veterans with catastrophic, service-connected disabilities free of 
charge, connect veterans to the VA for expanded access to the benefits 
they deserve, and restore veterans' dignity and independence while 
traveling.
  Traveling through standard airport checkpoints with severe injuries 
can present significant challenges for disabled veterans. They often 
must wait in long, winding lines, remove their shoes, and maintain 
balance to stand in a security scanner.
  For many disabled veterans, these can be difficult tasks and can 
present a fall hazard or require special assistance.
  By providing TSA PreCheck free of charge, my legislation will create 
a more honorable travel experience for veterans with prosthetics, 
vision impairment, paralysis, or relying on wheelchairs or other 
mobility aids.
  The VETS Safe Travel Act will also help create an improved airport 
experience for everyone by decreasing congestion at the standard 
security checkpoints.
  To obtain the benefit, the VA will certify that a veteran has a 
service-connected disability and is therefore eligible to apply for the 
program at no cost. TSA is also required to partner with veteran 
service organizations to make veterans aware of this benefit. TSA must 
also submit a report to Congress about the program to ensure it is 
working efficiently.
  Importantly, my bill specifically prohibits any budget gimmick used 
to offset costs by increasing the fees for other TSA PreCheck 
enrollees.
  This year, the Honor Flight Network welcomed 302 veterans from my 
home State of Arizona alone to our Nation's Capital. These veterans 
deserve the star treatment from departure to arrival and back.
  H.R. 7365 will ease the burden of any air travel on disabled 
veterans, their families, and caregivers and pave the way for 
additional disability reforms in veteran air travel.
  I thank the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security as well as 
the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for prioritizing the 
quality of life for our disabled veterans.
  I ask my colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation that helps 
disabled veterans who have sacrificed so much for our country.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time for closing.
  Mr. Speaker, we owe our disabled veterans not only our gratitude for 
their service but our commitment to their continued care. This is a 
sensible

[[Page H6568]]

bill that would help ensure disabled veterans are provided the benefits 
and dignity they deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this measure, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time to close.
  I am appreciative of both Mr. Gosar, as a veteran myself, and Mr. 
Thanedar, the Democrat cosponsor of this bill, for their hard work on 
it and their whipping of it and whipping me and the committee to get it 
done.
  I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7365, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7365, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                             General Leave

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 9668.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 9668, the SHIELD Against 
the CCP Act.
  Throughout the past few years, the Chinese Communist Party has 
increasingly threatened our security, the security of our homeland. We 
must begin to come up with serious solutions to this very serious 
problem, and this bill is an important start.
  This bill will require DHS to establish a working group to 
appropriately address and counter these threats.
  I commend my colleague, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong) for 
his work on this measure.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the actions of the Chinese Communist Party at home and 
around the world have shown us that China is intent on undermining the 
global standing of the United States and weakening democratic 
institutions and norms.
  According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 
China is expanding its covert influence and aims to sow doubts about 
U.S. leadership and undermine democracy, including by interfering in 
our elections.

                              {time}  1530

  The FBI director has stated that the CCP poses a broad and 
unrelenting threat to the United States critical infrastructure.
  H.R. 9668 would require the Department of Homeland Security to 
establish a working group to coordinate its efforts to address threats 
that the CCP poses to the homeland. The working group would evaluate 
threats posed by the CCP, identify what DHS is doing to address these 
threats, identify what more could be done to address these threats, and 
then facilitate coordination across DHS to holistically address the 
threats from the CCP.
  By supporting this bill, Congress can ensure that DHS has a strong 
and unified response to the Chinese Communist Party provocation and 
aggression.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong).
  Mr. STRONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 
9668, the SHIELD Against CCP Act.
  We can all agree that the Chinese Communist Party poses a clear and 
present danger to America's democracy and homeland security.
  The CCP exploits every possible avenue to undermine our national 
security, and the Biden-Harris administration's open southern border 
policy and soft-on-China policies have only aided our adversaries' 
ability to harm American interests.
  Our immigration system is routinely exploited by the CCP through 
identity theft, immigrant and nonimmigrant visa processes, and unlawful 
border crossings. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, 
in fiscal year 2021, there were 323 apprehensions of Chinese foreign 
nationals. Nearly 4 years of the Biden-Harris administration have 
ballooned that number to 64,000.
  In addition to exploiting our immigration system, the CCP also 
engages in theft of U.S. intellectual property and technology, which 
comes at a significant cost to our economy. It is estimated that 
China's IP theft alone costs the average American family of four 
anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000 annually after taxes. It is critical 
that DHS do more to combat these complex threats both at home and 
abroad.
  For these reasons, I introduced H.R. 9668, the SHIELD Against CCP 
Act. This legislation will require the Department of Homeland Security 
to establish a dedicated working group to counter threats posed to our 
homeland security by the Chinese Communist Party.
  Specifically, it will require them to examine, assess, and report on 
DHS' efforts to counter the threats posed by the CCP. To ensure DHS is 
held accountable, H.R. 9668 also requires DHS to report annually to 
Congress.
  It is our duty in Congress to ensure the safety and well-being of our 
great Nation, and we must not ignore the increasing aggression and 
influence of China on the global stage.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Green and all of the Members who have 
supported this legislation, and I urge all Members to join me in 
supporting this critically important piece of legislation to protect 
our national security and safeguard our interest.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi), who is the bill's Democratic 
lead.
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Green and Congresswoman 
Clarke, my good friend, for their leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of a bill I authored with Congressman 
Strong, the bipartisan SHIELD Against the CCP Act.
  The Chinese Communist Party is intent on promoting authoritarianism 
by weakening America from within. They seek to take our greatest 
strengths: pluralism, diversity, free speech, capitalism, and 
representative government, and use them against us.
  China uses our freedoms, our social media, and our open society to 
sow chaos and division in our country. They know we cannot solve 
difficult problems in an environment of fear and anger, so they 
encourage fear and anger. They promote the most extreme sides of our 
thorniest debates. Whether it is Black lives matter versus blue lives 
matter, or transgender versus evangelicals, or Israel versus Gaza, the 
Chinese Communist Party promotes the most extreme positions on both 
sides of the debate, not with an objective of winning a debate but of 
fomenting dissent in America.
  Add to this theft of our intellectual property, threats to our 
critical infrastructure, and trying to intimidate U.S. citizens through 
transnational repression. We must act.
  The fact that today we are promoting bipartisan legislation is our 
greatest possible response. Democrats and Republicans can work together 
to combat this threat.
  Our bipartisan bill counters the Chinese Communist Party with 
strength by, one, building the capacity of the Department of Homeland 
Security to

[[Page H6570]]

fight predatory economic and trade practices; two, preventing identity 
theft; three, strengthening our border security; four, providing the 
Department of Homeland Security with adequate resources to protect our 
critical infrastructure; five, improving cybersecurity; and, six, 
fighting transnational repression and criminal organizations.
  The FBI Director has stated that the CCP, the Chinese Communist 
Party, poses a broad and unrelenting threat. The Chinese Communist 
Party is also engaged in a brutal campaign of transnational repression, 
targeting democracy advocates, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Uyghurs, and 
other ethnic minority groups.
  The Chinese Communist Party actually targets Americans, including my 
constituents. Just before Thanksgiving, after years of fighting for his 
release, I received the incredible news that my constituent, Kai Li, 
was finally released to the U.S. after more than a decade of wrongful 
imprisonment in China. If we are to honor the years Mr. Li spent 
Chinese detention, then we must remain clear-eyed about the CCP threat 
and redouble our efforts to counter it.
  Among their provocative tactics is transnational repression, which 
can be illustrated through the torment of Dr. Gulshan Abbas and her 
family. In 2018, Dr. Abbas was taken to a Uyghur forced labor camp.
  What was her crime, Mr. Speaker?
  Her sister, Rushan Abbas, an American, spoke out against the Uyghur 
genocide during a panel discussion here in America, then her sister was 
put in prison in China.
  Think about it, Mr. Speaker. The CCP is not only carrying out mass 
detention, torture, forced sterilization, and forced labor against 
religious minorities within China, but also imprisoning family members 
of American citizens to suppress free expression here in America.
  Let me be clear: the United States cannot waver in the face of this 
unrelenting strategic adversary. Today, we must demonstrate our resolve 
by supporting the SHIELD Against CCP Act which will help ensure that 
our government has a strong and unified response to the Chinese 
Communist Party's aggression.
  Working with Congressman Strong demonstrates that when we work 
together, we will succeed.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation.
  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Strong and Suozzi for leading on 
this bill, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I echo those 
comments. This is another great bipartisan effort in the Committee on 
Homeland Security.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 9668, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 9668, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

                          ____________________

     proposes only investigative sampling of historic mine 
     residue, soil, sediment, or water that only includes the 
     requirements described in paragraph (1), the Administrator 
     may grant an investigative sampling permit that authorizes 
     the person only to carry out the plan of investigative 
     sampling of historic mine residue, soil, sediment, or water, 
     as described in the investigative sampling permit application 
     under paragraph (3).
       (B) Reprocessing.--An investigative sampling permit--

     investigative sampling permit concludes, a Good Samaritan to 
     whom an investigative sampling permit is granted under 
     paragraph (1) may apply to convert an investigative sampling 
     permit into a Good Samaritan permit under subsection (e)(1).
       (6) Permit not converted.--
       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B)(ii)(I), a Good 
     Samaritan who obtains an investigative sampling permit may 
     decline--
       (i) to apply to convert the investigative sampling permit 
     into a Good Samaritan permit under paragraph (5); and
       (ii) to undertake remediation activities on the site where 
     investigative sampling was conducted on conclusion of 
     investigative sampling.
       (B) Effect of lack of conversion.--
       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding a refusal by a Good 
     Samaritan to convert an investigative sampling permit into a 
     Good Samaritan permit under subparagraph (A), but subject to 
     clause (ii), the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) of 
     subsection (n) shall continue to apply to the Good Samaritan 
     and any cooperating persons after the refusal to convert.
       (ii) Degradation of surface water quality.--

       (I) Opportunity to correct.--If, before the date on which a 
     Good Samaritan refuses to convert an investigative sampling 
     permit under subparagraph (A), actions by the Good Samaritan 
     or any cooperating person have caused conditions at the 
     abandoned hardrock mine site to be measurably worse, as 
     determined by the Administrator, when compared to conditions 
     described pursuant to paragraph (3)(B), if applicable, the 
     Administrator shall provide the Good Samaritan or cooperating 
     person, as applicable, the opportunity to return the 
     conditions at the abandoned hardrock mine site to those 
     conditions.

[[Page H6573]]

       (II) Effect.--If, pursuant to subclause (I), the applicable 
     Good Samaritan or cooperating person does not return the 
     surface water quality at the abandoned hardrock mine site to 
     conditions described pursuant to paragraph (3)(B), if

     the records of the applicant relevant to compliance with the 
     requirements of the Good Samaritan permit; and
       (V) demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, 
     that--

       (aa) the applicant has, or has access to, the financial 
     resources to complete the project described in the Good 
     Samaritan permit application, including any long-term 
     monitoring and operations and maintenance that the 
     Administrator may require the applicant to perform in the 
     Good Samaritan permit; or
       (bb) the applicant has established a third-party financial 
     assurance mechanism, such as a corporate guarantee from a 
     parent or other corporate affiliate, letter of credit, trust, 
     surety bond, or insurance to assure that funds are available 
     to complete the permitted work, including for operations and 
     maintenance and to address potential contingencies, that--
       (AA) establishes the Administrator or the head of the 
     Federal land management agency as the beneficiary of the 
     third-party financial assurance mechanism; and
       (BB) allows the Administrator to retain and use the funds 
     from the financial assurance mechanism in the event the Good 
     Samaritan does not complete the remediation under the Good 
     Samaritan permit; and
       (vii) the project meets the requirements of this Act;
       (B) the State or Indian tribe with jurisdiction over land 
     on which the abandoned hardrock mine site is located has been 
     given an opportunity to review and, if necessary, comment on 
     the grant of the Good Samaritan permit;
       (C) in the case of a project proposed to be carried out

     permit that, as determined by the Administrator, is complete 
     and meets all applicable requirements of subsection (c); or
       (ii) such later date as may be determined by the 
     Administrator with notification provided to the applicant.
       (B) Constructive denial.--If the Administrator fails to 
     grant or deny a Good Samaritan permit by the applicable 
     deadline described in subparagraph (A), the application shall 
     be considered to be denied.
       (3) Discretionary action.--The issuance of a permit by the 
     Administrator and the approval of a project by the head of an 
     applicable Federal land management agency shall be considered 
     to be discretionary actions taken in the public interest.

       (1) Emergency authority.--Nothing in this section affects 
     the authority of--
       (A) the Administrator to take any responsive action 
     authorized by law; or
       (B) a Federal, State, Tribal, or local agency to carry out 
     any emergency authority, including an emergency authority 
     provided under Federal, State, Tribal, or local law.
       (2) Liability.--Except as specifically provided in this 
     Act, nothing in this Act, a Good Samaritan permit, or an 
     investigative sampling permit limits the liability of any 
     person (including a Good Samaritan or any cooperating person) 
     under any provision of law.
       (r) Termination of Good Samaritan Permit.--
       (1) In general.--A Good Samaritan permit shall terminate, 
     as applicable--
       (A) on inspection and notice from the Administrator to the 
     recipient of the Good Samaritan permit that the permitted 
     work has been completed in accordance with the terms of the 
     Good Samaritan permit, as determined by the Administrator;
       (B) if the Administrator terminates a permit under 
     paragraph (4)(B); or
       (C) except as provided in paragraph (2)--
       (i) on the date that is 18 months after the date on which 
     the Administrator granted the Good Samaritan permit, if the 
     permitted work has not commenced by that date; or
       (ii) if the grant of the Good Samaritan permit was the 
     subject of a petition for judicial review, on the date that 
     is 18 months after the date on which the judicial review, 
     including any appeals, has concluded, if the permitted work 
     has not commenced by that date.
       (2) Extension.--
       (A) In general.--If the Administrator is otherwise required 
     to terminate a Good Samaritan permit under paragraph (1)(C), 
     the Administrator may grant an extension of the Good 
     Samaritan permit.
       (B) Limitation.--Any extension granted under subparagraph 
     (A) shall be not more than 180 days for each extension.
       (3) Effect of termination.--
       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding the termination of a Good 
     Samaritan permit under paragraph (1), but subject to 
     subparagraph (B), the provisions of paragraphs (1) through 
     (4) of subsection (n) shall continue to apply to the Good 
     Samaritan and any cooperating persons after the termination, 
     including to any long-term operations and maintenance 
     pursuant to the agreement under paragraph (5).
       (B) Degradation of surface water quality.--
       (i) Opportunity to return to baseline conditions.--If, at 
     the time that 1 or more of the conditions described in 
     paragraph (1) are met but before the Good Samaritan permit is 
     terminated, actions by the Good Samaritan or cooperating 
     person have caused surface water quality at the abandoned 
     hardrock mine site to be measurably worse, as determined by 
     the Administrator, when compared to baseline conditions 
     described in the permit, the Administrator shall, before 
     terminating the Good Samaritan permit, provide the Good 
     Samaritan or cooperating person, as applicable, the 
     opportunity to return surface water quality to those baseline 
     conditions.
       (ii) Effect.--If, pursuant to clause (i), the applicable 
     Good Samaritan or cooperating person does not return the 
     surface water quality at the abandoned hardrock mine site to 
     the baseline conditions described in the permit, as 
     determined by the Administrator, subparagraph (A) shall not 
     apply to the Good Samaritan or any cooperating persons.
       (4) Unforeseen circumstances.--
       (A) In general.--The recipient of a Good Samaritan permit 
     may seek to modify or terminate the Good Samaritan permit to 
     take into account any event or condition that--
       (i) significantly reduces the feasibility or significantly 
     increases the cost of completing the remediation project that 
     is the subject of the Good Samaritan permit;
       (ii) was not--

       (I) reasonably contemplated by the recipient of the Good 
     Samaritan permit; or
       (II) taken into account in the remediation plan of the 
     recipient of the Good Samaritan permit; and

       (iii) is beyond the control of the recipient of the Good 
     Samaritan permit, as determined by the Administrator.
       (B) Termination.--The Administrator shall terminate a Good 
     Samaritan permit if--
       (i) the recipient of the Good Samaritan permit seeks 
     termination of the permit under subparagraph (A);

[[Page H6576]]

       (ii) the factors described in subparagraph (A) are 
     satisfied; and
       (iii) the Administrator determines that remediation 
     activities conducted by the Good Samaritan or cooperating 
     person pursuant to the Good Samaritan permit may result in 
     surface water quality conditions, or any other environmental 
     conditions, that will be worse than the baseline conditions, 
     as described in the Good Samaritan permit, as applicable.
       (5) Long-term operations and maintenance.--In the case of a 
     project that involves long-term operations and maintenance at 
     an abandoned hardrock mine site located on land owned by the 
     United States, the project may be considered complete and the 
     Administrator, in coordination with the applicable Federal 
     land management agency, may terminate the Good Samaritan 
     permit under this subsection if the applicable Good Samaritan 
     has entered into an agreement with the applicable Federal 
     land management agency or a cooperating person for the long-
     term operations and maintenance that includes sufficient 
     funding for the long-term operations and maintenance.
       (s) Regulations.--
       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the 
     Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
     Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, and appropriate 
     State, Tribal, and local officials, may promulgate any 
     regulations that the Administrator determines to be necessary 
     to carry out this Act.
       (2) Guidance if no regulations promulgated.--
       (A) In general.--If the Administrator does not initiate a 
     regulatory process to promulgate regulations under paragraph 
     (1) within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
     the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
     Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and appropriate 
     State, Tribal, and local officials, shall issue guidance 
     establishing specific requirements that the Administrator 
     determines would facilitate the implementation of this 
     section.
       (B) Public comments.--Before finalizing any guidance issued 
     under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall hold a 30-day 
     public comment period.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Utah (Ms. Maloy) and the gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Utah.


                             General Leave

  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on S. 2781.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2781, the 
bipartisan and bicameral Good Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned 
Hardrock Mines Act of 2024.
  I am the Republican cosponsor of the House companion legislation. 
This bill is critical to removing the obstacles that are preventing the 
cleanup and remediation of important land and water resources across 
our Nation.
  This map shows the hundreds of thousands of estimated abandoned mines 
sprinkled across the United States. This is not only a western issue, 
but a national one. Historic mining in the U.S. predates modern 
environmental laws and current reclamation standards. This leads to the 
creation of abandoned hardrock mine lands, which can pose environmental 
and safety risks to surrounding areas and communities.
  Despite the danger, non-profit organizations, mining companies, State 
agencies, and other stakeholders with the willingness and expertise to 
clean up these abandoned mines are deterred from taking action.
  Under the Clean Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, Good Samaritans 
who wish to clean up an abandoned mine would assume liability for the 
preexisting mine waste or pollution that they did not create. As a 
result, remediation efforts are stopped before they can even begin.
  This bill directs the EPA to establish a pilot permitting program for 
15 low-risk projects to allow true Good Samaritans, with no legal or 
financial responsibility or connection to an abandoned hardrock mine 
site, to remediate and clean up sites leading to improved environmental 
and safety conditions.
  S. 2781 is the right start to allow for the cleanup and remediation 
of these mines in Utah and across the country while providing narrowly 
targeted liability protections for Good Samaritan volunteers.
  This bill has robust bipartisan support from a significant number of 
stakeholders across the political spectrum. The legislation also passed 
out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee by voice vote, 
the full Senate by unanimous consent, and the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee by voice vote in September.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2781, the Good 
Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act of 2024, authored 
by Senator Heinrich of New Mexico.
  This bipartisan bill, also introduced in the House by Representative 
Maloy and myself, would address the significant environmental challenge 
posed by tens of thousands of abandoned hardrock mining sites by 
creating a pathway for Good Samaritan entities to receive the legal 
assurances they need to move ahead with remediation of historic mine 
pollution.
  I applaud the bipartisan work that has gotten the bill to this point, 
and I am pleased to see that we are on the cusp of enactment.
  The potential harm to the environment and society caused by these 
abandoned mines is great. Tens of thousands of miles of streams around 
the Nation are contaminated by acid and metals drained from these 
abandoned mine sites, and hundreds of thousands of acres of lakes and 
reservoirs are impacted from runoff from abandoned mines.
  The Good Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act of 
2024 would establish a pilot program to allow EPA to issue certain 
permits to allow remediation of abandoned hardrock mine sites.
  The legislation has the support of a range of outdoor conservation 
groups, including American Rivers, National Parks Conservation 
Association, National Wildlife Federation, The Nature Conservancy, and 
Trout Unlimited.

[[Page H6577]]

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. Moore).
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Utah for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Good Samaritan 
Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act of 2024 introduced by my 
colleague Representative Maloy from Utah.
  Around the country, and particularly in the West, thousands of 
historic hardrock mines lay abandoned, posing risks to public health 
and the environment.
  Many of these sites sit on the same public land on which we recreate 
and thoroughly enjoy. The leftover residues, chemicals, and harmful 
contaminants affect thousands of miles of streams and waterways, 
endangering wildlife and fish.
  Clearly, there is a problem to be solved here. Too often in this body 
of Congress, we create more problems than actual solutions.
  This bill is fundamentally different for the way that it tries to 
approach and address this issue that exists out in our communities.
  This bill will accelerate remediation work by allowing Good Samaritan 
organizations and State agencies to voluntarily take action and clean 
up abandoned mines to protect water quality.
  With the enactment of this bill, we will help ensure that these sites 
are restored and no longer pose risks to the public. A key word on that 
is ``voluntarily.'' If we get in the way of these Good Samaritan and 
State agencies to actually solve this issue, we will continue to have 
these problems going forward.
  In Utah, we know the importance of being good stewards of our 
resources, and this legislation is vital to passing on our land to 
future generations.
  I thank Congresswoman Maloy and her work on this issue, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill.

                              {time}  1545

  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 2781.
  To be clear, I strongly support cleaning up abandoned mines, but this 
bill contains language that would undermine the cleanups it aims to 
support. It opens the floodgates for bad actors to take advantage of 
Superfund liability shields and loopholes created by this legislation 
for the very first time.
  Providing broad Superfund exemptions undermines our ability to 
protect the communities we are elected to serve. For example, during a 
cleanup, a so-called Good Samaritan may do an inadequate job or make 
the toxic contamination at a site worse. Under this bill, they would 
not be held responsible for the harm that they caused. By exempting 
polluters from liability, Congress would be shifting the costs of these 
cleanups onto the taxpayers, and I don't think that is right.
  I fear that Congress is opening a Pandora's box, where every 
corporation and polluter will be asking for their own sweetheart 
Superfund exemption. What is more, this bill gives the incoming Trump 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator unilateral power to 
decide which entities are Good Samaritans and which are not.
  The Trump EPA also has sole power to choose which sites get selected 
for the program and to determine if a site is truly cleaned up in a 
reasonable amount of time under vague terms that make it difficult to 
ensure that adequate protection for human health and the environment 
takes place.
  Mr. Speaker, EPA, the agency in charge of implementing the provisions 
of this bill, has also expressed serious concerns. The bill opens the 
program to additional litigation, takes away the possibility of 
downstream communities' holding Good Samaritans accountable in case of 
a spill, and leaves taxpayers on the hook to pay for cleaning up 
pollution that is discovered after a permit expires.
  Mr. Speaker, for decades, the Superfund program has worked to clean 
up toxic sites across the Nation, particularly those contaminated with 
radioactive material and heavy metals. It has a strong bipartisan 
history of cleaning up sites, regardless of location and regardless of 
who is responsible or which political party controls Congress or the 
White House.
  I believe allowing the Trump EPA to politicize this successful law is 
a mistake. Giving the Trump EPA additional tools to undermine Superfund 
cleanups should not be the way to close out this Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I have consistently been willing to work with bill 
supporters to address deficiencies and recognize the critical role that 
Good Samaritans play in mine cleanups while also making sure we don't 
create new toxic Superfund sites in the process. Unfortunately, 
attempts by me and others to improve this bill or alleviate those 
concerns have not been granted or didn't take place.
  Mr. Speaker, I simply cannot support the way this bill is phrased. I 
urge a ``no'' vote.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. Fulcher).
  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her work and 
leadership on this measure.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2781, the Good Samaritan 
Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act of 2024.
  According to the Government Accountability Office, there are over 
140,000 abandoned hardrock mines on Federal lands. At least 22,500 of 
these mines pose serious dangers to the communities around them. 
Historically, the Coeur d'Alene mining district in Idaho stands as one 
of the most productive mining regions in silver and lead in the United 
States, with a legacy dating back to the 1890s. However, this history 
has resulted in thousands of abandoned hardrock mines on Federal lands. 
In some cases, they degrade the environment.
  This bill simply provides limited liability protections for groups 
willing to step up and help. It allows Good Samaritans, nonprofits, 
private organizations, and local governments to clean up and remediate 
these sites effectively without fear of incurring harmful liability 
under the framework of CERCLA and the Clean Water Act.
  Mr. Speaker, this is needed. Government can't and shouldn't do 
everything. This legislation simply encourages public-private 
partnerships to tackle this issue and do it in an effective and 
affordable way.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues' support of this bill.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. DeGette).
  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan Good 
Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act.
  This bill would establish a pilot program for 15 low-risk abandoned 
mine remediation projects to be approved by the EPA and to be conducted 
by qualified State agencies, local governments, and nonprofits. It does 
not provide unlimited protection for everybody. It is a pilot project.
  In Colorado and across the West, we are surrounded by the legacy of 
our pioneering mining industry, but with that comes the responsibility 
to address what is left behind at mining sites.
  According to the GAO, of the nearly 140,000 abandoned hardrock mines 
in the U.S., we have 23,000 of them in Colorado alone, with over 7,400 
of them posing environmental risks. Under current law, groups that 
volunteer to clean or restore a former mining site could become liable 
for the site, even if the group played no role in causing the pollution 
before remediating the site. The Colorado Department of Natural 
Resources has told me that that hurdle has stopped cleanup efforts in 
Colorado.
  This bill represents a critical step forward, empowering those 
nonresponsible parties that are ready, willing, and able to help and to 
improve water quality in and around abandoned hardrock mines to obtain 
a permit to clean up those sites.
  By establishing a pilot program, abandoned mines can be remediated 
over the next 7 years, and we will learn lessons on how to best permit 
and manage remediation of those sites going forward.

[[Page H6578]]

  In September 2023, the Biden administration's recommendations to 
improve mining on public lands called for the establishment of a Good 
Samaritan remediation. The administration strongly supports the 
establishment of a Good Samaritan remediation program through the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill that would allow us to 
address important environmental issues.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Graves).
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from 
Utah (Ms. Maloy) and the gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola) for 
coming together on this important bipartisan legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that there are abandoned mines all over 
the United States. There are very few in Louisiana because you hit 
water when you go subsurface in most cases, but we do have some mines 
in the northern part of the State.
  The reason I am excited about this legislation is because it 
incentivizes the right type of behavior.
  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues need to think about the two alternatives 
here. One alternative is that these abandoned mines and the 
environmental risks that they pose are left unadulterated. They would 
be left behind with the risk and the threat.
  The other is you allow the work of a Good Samaritan, someone who 
wants to come in to help carry out remediation efforts. This can't be 
someone that created the mine. It can't be someone who is a PRP or 
otherwise has liability associated with the mine. They are folks who 
want to come in to eliminate the risk, to reduce the risk, and to clean 
things up.
  This is exactly the type of behavior that we should be incentivizing. 
This is exactly what we should be doing.
  In fact, I would love to see us actually expand this into areas like 
coastal Louisiana, where we have lost 2,000 square miles of our coast, 
incentivizing Good Samaritans to come in to carry out remediation 
efforts or restoration efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola) for 
taking a leadership role and working together with my good friend, the 
gentlewoman from Utah (Ms. Maloy), on this great bipartisan 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I will say it again. This type of pilot program is the 
exact thing that we should be doing on a broader basis, on an expanded 
basis, because this incentivizes the right type of behavior. It 
eliminates risk and eliminates threats to the environment, and I 
appreciate this legislation being brought up.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Ms. Lee).
  Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Peltola and Ms. Maloy 
for their leadership.
  Abandoned hardrock mines are scattered all across the American West, 
including in my own district, which is home to some of the oldest mine 
lands in Nevada. Their pollutants are poisoning our waters, threatening 
Tribal lands and resources, and creating hazardous landscapes that have 
injured and killed Americans.
  A range of highly qualified partners, from State and local agencies 
to the nonprofit guardians of America's great outdoors, such as Trout 
Unlimited, stand ready to work with the Federal Government to clean up 
these sites.
  Today's bipartisan, bicameral legislation will safely and responsibly 
cut through red tape currently preventing these Good Samaritans from 
doing so. It has taken 25 years of consensus building to craft this 
version of the Good Sam bill now on the floor. That is a quarter 
century of collaboration that has earned this version of the bill the 
support of every Member of the U.S. Senate; our Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee; a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, myself 
included, who have led the charge to get this legislation across the 
finish line in this Congress; and stakeholders from The Nature 
Conservancy to the National Congress of American Indians and the 
Western Governors' Association.
  Mr. Speaker, here is a sobering reminder: Across these multiple 
decades, abandoned hardrock mines have continued to send mercury, 
arsenic, lead, and other toxic materials into our rivers and 
communities.
  Let's take a look back in history to highlight just one example.
  When the Senator from Montana first proposed the Good Sam legislation 
back in 1999, officials from the State were hoping that it would 
provide a pathway for them to help clean up an 1800s-era abandoned mine 
polluting Montana's Corbin Creek. After 25 years, with Good Sam bill 
after Good Sam bill dying here in Washington, Corbin Creek still 
remains on Montana's list of impaired waters to this day, and for no 
good reason since Good Samaritans have been willing to actively assist.
  The time for talking is over. It is now time for the House to act. 
Before Congress adjourns, we have a historic opportunity to put our 
Nation on an accelerated path to cleaner waters and safer landscapes. 
This Good Sam bill is a good bill.
  The Clean Water Act and Superfund both aim to restore and maintain 
     the integrity of America's waters, and this bill moves us 
     closer to that objective. It also includes multiple 
     protections and provisions to prevent any abuse or 
     backsliding.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask both my Republican and Democratic colleagues to 
join me in voting at long last to pass it.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, mining is a very interesting field, and a lot of modern 
mining is very, very environmentally conscious. I think it is 
noteworthy to recognize that all rock is between zero to six or seven 
stages of acid rock leaching. All that means is, if acid-leaching rock 
is crushed, its exposure to water and air becomes a contaminant to 
fish.
  Acid-rock drainage was not very well understood in some of the early 
mines, and I know that there are a lot of entities that are very 
interested and have a lot of philanthropic money behind them to put 
toward remediation and reclamation.
  This act provides a reasonable, commonsense approach to ensure that 
voluntary parties that had nothing to do with the cause of pollution 
are able to take steps to reduce the environmental health and safety 
problems associated with abandoned mine sites.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the 
purposes of closing.
  The Good Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act, the 
Good Samaritan Act, is the right step forward. There is a clear irony 
here that the Clean Water Act and CERCLA are unintentionally standing 
in the way of sensible, low-risk mine cleanups.
  I ask that my colleagues support this monumental legislation, the 
concepts for which have been in the works for over two decades. The 
strong bipartisan nature of this bill cannot be overstated, with 
Senators and Members of Congress working alongside stakeholders and 
industry leaders across the political spectrum, including the White 
House, to make this bill into law.
  I thank my co-lead, Congresswoman Mary Peltola, for her leadership 
and partnership and for the support of the bill's bipartisan 
cosponsors.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1600

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentlewoman from Utah (Ms. Maloy) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, S. 2781.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

AMTRAK TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PASSENGERS AND TAXPAYERS ACT

  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8692) to require that the Amtrak Board of Directors comply with 
the open meetings requirements of section 552b of title 5, United 
States Code, and for other purposes, as amended.

[[Page H6579]]

  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 8692

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Amtrak Transparency and 
     Accountability for Passengers and Taxpayers Act''.

     SEC. 2. OPEN MEETINGS.

       Section 24301(e) of title 49, United States Code, is 
     amended--
       (1) by striking ``Section 552 of title 5, this part'' and 
     inserting the following:
       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), 
     sections 552 and 552b of title 5, this part'';
       (2) in the second sentence by striking ``Section 552 of 
     title 5, United States Code, applies'' and inserting the 
     following:
       ``(2) Timing of application.--Except as provided in

       ``(A) Information.--The requirements of the second sentence 
     of section 552b(b) of title 5 shall not apply to any portion 
     of an Amtrak meeting and subsections (d) and (e) of section 
     552b of title 5 shall not apply to any information pertaining 
     to any portion of an Amtrak meeting otherwise required by 
     section 552b of title 5 to be disclosed to the public in any 
     case in which Amtrak properly determines that such portion or 
     portions of the meeting or the disclosure of such information 
     is likely to involve--
       ``(i) contract negotiations, including negotiations for 
     contract procurements and agreements, the disclosure of which 
     would imperil or compromise the competitive position of 
     Amtrak;
       ``(ii) collective bargaining agreements or any terms and 
     conditions that are proposed for inclusion in any collective 
     bargaining agreement, including the negotiation of terms and 
     conditions with employees or representatives of employees of

     request in writing that the matter or matters be discussed at 
     a public meeting.
       ``(B) Additional application.--In addition to the 
     information described in subparagraph (B), the information 
     described in section 552b(c) shall apply to Amtrak 
     meetings.''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Utah (Ms. Maloy) and the gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola) each 
will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Utah.


                             General Leave

  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 8692.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Utah?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the Government in the Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, was 
established to increase the public's confidence in its government.
  Under the Sunshine Act, meetings of government agencies must be open 
to the public unless one of the statute's exemptions apply.
  The act defines an agency as one headed by a collegial body, a 
majority of whose members are nominated by the President, and whose 
appointment is subject to advice and consent of the Senate. This 
clearly describes Amtrak.
  The need for full transparency at Amtrak has never been greater. Here 
are just a few examples.
  First, last fiscal year, Amtrak reported operating losses of $757 
million. These were losses made up for by taxpayers. Its Acela II train 
sets are more than 3 years behind schedule, and the delays have cost 
Amtrak more than $140 million in lost revenues.
  Additionally, the Northeast Corridor Commission estimates its state 
of good repair backlog on the Northeast Corridor exceeds $78.7 billion. 
Further, the Biden administration's infrastructure law provides for 
more than $66 billion in advanced appropriations that Amtrak can use to 
expand service, regardless of the need to make a profit.
  With so much of the taxpayers' money in Amtrak's hands, there clearly 
needs to be more transparency and accountability for the decisions made 
by the passenger rail service's board, and this bill provides just 
that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8692. This bill requires 
Amtrak's board of directors to hold open meetings, ensures the public 
is notified of upcoming meetings, and allows the public to observe 
board meetings.
  The bill increases transparency and allows exceptions when certain 
sensitive financial and contractual obligations are discussed, 
including contract negotiations with Amtrak's workers.
  Transparency is important, and the concept of open board meetings has 
support from the Rail Passengers Association and the States for 
Passenger Rail Coalition.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Nehls).
  Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8692, the Amtrak Transparency and 
Accountability for Passengers and Taxpayers Act, is essential 
legislation for mandating transparency from Amtrak.
  This bill applies the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976 to 
Amtrak, requiring meetings of its board of directors to be open to 
public observation with certain exceptions.
  Amtrak's status as a governmental entity for the purposes of the 
Sunshine Act is beyond dispute. All its voting board members are 
nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It shares 
characteristics with other government-created and -sponsored entities 
that require board of director meetings to be open.
  Amtrak receives substantial taxpayer support. Never in its more than 
50-year history has it made a profit, and now it has access to more 
than $66 billion. That is with a b, Mr. Speaker. For those of you 
upstairs, that is $66 billion in taxpayer support through the Biden 
administration's infrastructure law.
  How this funding will be utilized and how Amtrak is managed is of 
great importance to its customers, employees, and taxpayers at large.
  It is often said that sunshine is the best disinfectant. Opening up 
many of Amtrak's board of director meetings will better ensure that its 
decisions are made in the best interest of the public. With so much at 
stake, Amtrak should not be the exception to transparency.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Chairman Graves and the members of the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for supporting H.R. 
8692, and I urge support of this legislation.
  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, this bill will increase transparency of 
Amtrak decisions as Amtrak uses Federal funding to improve operations, 
and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. MALOY. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8692 represents an important step in 
providing much-needed transparency and accountability to meetings by 
Amtrak's board of directors and the decisions they make that involve 
billions of taxpayer dollars.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentlewoman from Utah (Ms. Maloy) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 8692, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                    UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS DAY

  (Mrs. LEE CARTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. LEE CARTER. Mr. Speaker, today on U.N. Human Rights Day we 
reaffirm our commitment to justice, equality, and human dignity, values 
that are reflected in Texas' 18th Congressional District. I hope that 
we, as Members of Congress and Americans, reflect it, as well.
  Houston resettles over 3,000 refugees annually through the U.N. 
Refugee Agency, supported by organizations like the Alliance and YMCA 
International, providing housing, education, and healthcare for 
refugees.
  With over 300,000 human trafficking victims in Texas, collaboration 
with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has been vital, supporting 
programs like the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition.
  My mother, the late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, worked closely 
with the U.N. to address human rights issues. She partnered with the 
World Health Organization to combat public health disparities, focusing 
on maternal health and HIV/AIDS in underserved communities.
  Additionally, she supported the U.N.'s efforts after Hurricane 
Harvey, helping to coordinate relief and provided essential resources 
to displaced families.
  As we honor Human Rights Day, let us remember the dignity of all who 
traverse this great Earth we call our home, and let us continue these 
efforts and advance justice and equality for all.

                          ____________________

                         HONORING JOHN W. MIXON

  (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
Georgian, Mr. John W. Mixon. Mr. John has made almost an immeasurable 
impact on the State of Georgia.
  After graduating from the University of Georgia, Mr. John went to 
work in the timber industry for the Great Southern Paper Company and 
then worked for the Georgia Forestry Commission.
  For the next 34 years, John Mixon played the leading role in turning 
Georgia into the number one State in America for forestry. His work was 
both visionary and comprehensive.
  Starting as a technician and rising to the director of the 
commission, he worked tirelessly toward his goal of making the Georgia 
forest industry into what it is today.
  He started the Reforestation Commission that was responsible for 
planting a world record 600,000 acres of pine trees. He established 
Georgia's first forestry museum, an educational forest, and the Georgia 
Tree Coalition, which planted thousands of trees in the 1996 Olympic 
venues throughout the State.
  John served and held leadership positions in numerous professional 
and civic organizations and received the Soil Conservationist of the 
Year award from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the highest recognition of his professional 
contribution was receiving the Wise Owl Award from the Georgia Forestry 
Association. This significant achievement was well earned and deserved.
  As a result of Mr. John Mixon's vision and hard work, literally 
thousands of Georgians work in the timber industry, and the industry 
has massively impacted the economic well-being of Georgia.
  Just as importantly, Georgia's environment is better off, and the 
timber industry is environmentally sustainable. We all owe Mr. John 
Mixon a debt of gratitude for making our world a much better place.

  PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR OF H.R. 4545

  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter 
be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 4545, a bill originally 
introduced by Representative Gallagher of Wisconsin, for the purpose of 
adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of 
rule XII.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?
  There was no objection.

            CONGRATULATING JACK FELTON, A LIFELONG VOLS FAN

  (Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate a very fine young man from 
Tennessee's Second District, young

[[Page H6582]]

Jack Felton. Jack is a proud member of the fall 2024 pledge class of 
the Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 
where he was recently initiated.
  Jack graduated from the Webb School of Knoxville, where he served as 
captain of the baseball team and played shortstop. He thinks quickly, 
he has got steady hands, and he works very hard.
  Jack is majoring in agribusiness. I know he will find success 
wherever his life takes him. I know his parents, and they have raised 
him well.
  Jack has four sisters; three are here, and one sweet little girl is 
in heaven.
  Jack has been a lifelong Vols fan, and he is fourth in the family to 
attend UT. He truly bleeds orange, Mr. Speaker.
  I have no doubt Jack will continue to make his family proud by 
attending every single class, as his father did, and not staying out 
late when he should be in the library.
  Mr. Speaker, as a reminder, one of our other fraternity brothers, 
Scott Davis, owned a bar on the Cumberland Avenue Strip, and its name 
was The Library.
  I look forward to seeing all the great things he will accomplish, and 
I expect to see his pledge class at the top of the GPA leaderboard this 
semester.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jack on his initiation. Go Vols. ``In hoc 
signo vinces.'' ``In this sign you will conquer.''

                     CONGRATULATING MAYOR JIM LUKE

  (Mr. EZELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EZELL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to extend heartfelt 
congratulations to Mayor Jim Luke on being named the recipient of the 
prestigious 2024 Excellence in Government Award. This is a remarkable 
achievement, and Mayor Luke is only the second mayor in history to 
receive such an honor.
  Luke has spent his career improving the city of Picayune, 
Mississippi, starting his career as a police officer at the Picayune 
Police Department. Under Luke's leadership, the Picayune Police 
Department achieved significant advancements in community engagement 
and public safety.
  Luke initiated innovative programs such as the Teen 411 Program and 
the police camp aimed at fostering positive relationships between law 
enforcement and youth.
  As chief, he spearheaded the Partnership, Pride, and Progress Program 
which revolutionized public safety technological capabilities without 
incurring additional cost to the city.
  Through innovative partnerships with local businesses, the program 
facilitated the exchange of information and resources beneficial to law 
enforcement and the community. His outstanding dedication and visionary 
leadership and tireless commitment to improving the lives of those in 
Picayune have truly earned him this recognition. We are incredibly 
fortunate to have such a dedicated leader guiding our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mayor Luke for his exceptional contributions and 
for serving the city of Picayune with unwavering distinction.

            HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL ALEXANDER RAIMONDI

  (Mr. LAWLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Michael 
Alexander Raimondi, a remarkable young man from Westchester County, who 
was tragically taken from us far too soon. Michael was a bright and 
imaginative soul who brought joy to everyone around him.
  A student at Somers High School and a member of the Westchester 
County Police Cadet program, he had begun exploring his love for 
forensic science and criminal justice. His creativity knew no bounds, 
from crafting intricate origami designs to building automotive LEGO 
masterpieces with his brother and grandfather.
  Michael's gentle and nurturing spirit shone through in his love for 
animals, his deep bonds with family, and his quiet yet purposeful way 
of expressing himself. His love for music, gaming, and endless laughter 
with his brother, Matthew, created memories that will live forever in 
the hearts of those who loved him.
  Though his time with us was far too brief, Michael's vibrant spirit 
and boundless imagination left an indelible mark on Somers and all of 
the Hudson Valley.
  May his memory be a blessing to his family and all who knew him.

                  CONGRATULATING WARE COUNTY, GEORGIA

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ware 
County, Georgia, for celebrating its 200th year anniversary.
  Ware County was founded in 1824 and resides in Georgia's First 
Congressional District, which I have the honor and privilege of 
representing.
  Originally carved from Appling County, Ware County was named after 
the United States Senator, Nicholas Ware, who served as the mayor of 
Augusta, Georgia, before his term in the Senate.
  Today, Ware County is recognized as one of the leading counties in 
south Georgia, as it is home to the 451st militia district, the oldest 
in our entire country.
  The county site, Waycross, has grown from a small town with nothing 
more than a log courthouse to a city serving 14,000 people and large 
manufacturing companies such as Stewart's Candy Company.
  Waycross is also bordered by the beautiful Satilla River, which 
became a busy route in the early 1800s for transporting longleaf pine 
trees to sawmills on the coast.
  In fact, Waycross is the largest city in the largest county in the 
largest State east of the Mississippi.
  I am proud to celebrate this anniversary with Ware County and our 
great State of Georgia.

                     FALL OF SYRIAN DICTATOR ASSAD

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday morning, a new day dawned 
in Syria. The world saw stunning images of liberty emerge in the 
world's oldest continuously inhabited capital city of Damascus.
  Syria was freed from the 55-year-old regime of Bashar al-Assad, who 
had turned it into a dictatorship.
  It was not totally clear who the rebel factions were that swarmed 
through the towns of Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, and then the capital city.
  As a result of the fall of Assad, the spiderweb of tyranny between 
Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China has been weakened.
  Iran and Russia could no longer prop up their puppet. The days ahead 
for Syria are uncertain, but the Syrian people deserve a chance to 
rebuild a civil nation of their choosing after decades of turmoil. 
Hopefully, it will be a tolerant society, accepting of people from all 
religious confessions.
  Under that dictatorship, over 500,000 people suffered horror and 
death at the hands of Assad. Others were held warrantlessly in 
captivity by this ruthless dictator. My hope is that the Syrian people 
may have the chance to write their own intelligent chapter in human 
history.

  While the future of Syria remains uncertain, we should recognize this 
spirit of triumph. Millions who fled the scourge of war will have a 
chance to return home free of bombs.

                             CHRISTMAS 1777

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Wied). Under the Speaker's announced 
policy of January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time to come here in December. 
I am not sure if we will get time next week here on the floor.
  As we look forward to Christmas, I think it is important to remember 
why we are here and why we are here in the House.
  Christmas 1777 was one of the lowest and most desperate points of 
American

[[Page H6583]]

history. General Washington, fresh off defeats at Brandywine and 
Germantown had marched the battered Continental Army to winter quarters 
at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Frozen rain, snow, and brutally cold 
temperatures tested not only the men's resolve to fight for freedom, 
but their bodies' ability to withstand the elements.
  They showed up low on provisions. It was so bad that in a letter on 
December 23, General Washington wrote to Henry Laurens of the 
Continental Congress: ``I am now convinced beyond a doubt, that unless 
some great and capital change suddenly takes place . . . this Army must 
inevitably be reduced to one or other of these three things: Starve, 
dissolve, or disperse. . . . [This] is not an exaggerated picture. . . 
. `'
  Historians estimate that as many as one-third of them didn't have 
boots or shoes. Washington ordered soldiers to build wooden huts for 
themselves to stave off the cold and search the surrounding countryside 
for straw to make bedding to keep them warm. They didn't have enough 
blankets to go around after all.
  In the same letter, Washington also noted that his Army was in danger 
from the enemy. General Howe was nearby, and Washington needed his men 
ready to rock and roll, but they couldn't do it.
  ``I ordered the troops to be in readiness,'' for an attack, 
Washington wrote. ``When behold to my great mortification . . . the men 
were unable to stir on account of provision. . . . `'
  ``All I could do under these circumstances was to send out a few 
light parties to watch and harass the enemy. . . . `'
  His officers were resigned to leaving the camp, and he fretted that 
without congressional action otherwise ``I much doubt the 
practicability of holding the Army together much longer.''
  Mr. Speaker, how did we get here?
  Twelve months earlier had been one of the high points of the 
Revolution and Washington's military career--victories at Trenton, 
victories at Princeton, the Crossing of the Delaware and the daring 
Christmas Day surprise attack on the Hessians.
  This year it was burnt mutton and watered-down grog for an Army that 
was cold, starving, and on the brink.
  Mr. Speaker, 2,100 out of 10,000 would die there from disease and 
exposure.
  We know that is not the end of the story. We know that because I am 
standing here on this floor in the United States House of 
Representatives as a citizen of the greatest country in the world.
  Baron Von Steuben got to camp in 1778 and started whipping the 
Continental Army into better shape, and Washington's men kept up the 
fight until Yorktown 3 long years later.
  However, now, Mr. Speaker, to my friends and colleagues who are here 
in the Chamber, the few remaining, it is now our turn to fight. We are 
at a relatively speaking low point in our country's history due to the 
unbelievable but yet completely observable negligence, nay, I say 
purposeful actions of the current administration to undermine the 
safety, security, prosperity, and well-being of our people and our 
Nation.

  We have millions of people who have been dumped into our country 
illegally, including criminals. We have $36 trillion in debt, another 
$2 trillion a year. It is really another $1 trillion every 100 days, a 
little over 3 months.
  Americans are in record levels of personal debt because of the record 
levels of inflation and a hamstrung economy by bureaucrats and 
progressive radical Democrats who want to micromanage your life and 
regulate your life to death, tell you what stoves you can use, what 
cars you can drive, drive up the price of cars, your houses, your 
schools, your healthcare, and then thank you for the privilege.
  The world around us is in chaos. We see what is happening in Syria. 
We saw what is happening in South Korea, and we see what is happening 
around the globe, Ukraine, and Russia, the empowerment of Iran, 
although, thankfully, the resolve of Israel is standing strong while 
our country has walked away from that fight.
  That is all due to the weakness of the Biden administration that it 
has shown for 4 years. Now it is our calling in this Congress to stand 
up alongside President Trump to stand up and fix it. However, the 
calling for our Congress is not to simply walk back some of the 
failures of this administration. It is not to ask for some quick fixes. 
It is to fundamentally change the trajectory of our country.

                              {time}  1730

  It is to take bold action. It is to pass serious legislation. It is 
to fundamentally change our reliance on debt and profligate spending 
that is indebting our children and driving up inflation because we are 
spending money we don't have.
  We have an obligation to fight for the American people. That is our 
calling as we wrap up this year. We have several really important 
fights and debates to continue to finish, such as the National Defense 
Authorization Act, which, unbelievably, our Democratic colleagues are 
resisting and saying they aren't going to support. Why? Because 
Republicans have taken the position that we shouldn't have taxpayer 
funding at the Pentagon for transgender surgeries for children.
  Our Democratic colleagues are so committed to the mutilation of 
children that they would choose not to authorize the defense of the 
United States. That is the world in which we are currently operating, 
and it is Republicans who are standing here in defense of our children 
while trying to make sure our defense is strong.
  The NDAA is not where it should be. Let me be clear, because of 
radical progressive Democrats in the Senate and the House, we have 
miles to go.
  We have an obligation to do our job. We have an obligation to not 
spend money that we don't have. We have an obligation to pay for the 
disaster aid that so many of my colleagues understandably want and seek 
for their constituents in the wake of hurricane damage, drought, or 
issues that are facing our people. We have an obligation to pay for 
these things, or else we are no better than the people we criticize.
  Come January, after we do whatever we are going to do here in 
December with respect to the funding of government, such as the 
disaster funding, the national defense bill, the farm bill, all issues 
that are still ripe before us--we have a new President, a new Congress 
coming in, a new Senate, all Republican--what will we do? I am here to 
suggest to you that, through the reconciliation tools, we can make 
serious change.
  Now, here, I pause for a second. I have colleagues of mine who, 
rightly, on both sides of the aisle, will point out that reconciliation 
is supposed to be a budget tool for reconciling the budget and ensuring 
that we are, frankly, working to achieve balance and not spending more 
money than we should. That very much should be the priority of budget 
reconciliation, and I will endeavor to ensure that we follow that path.
  I remind the American people that the reason they cannot afford 
healthcare, the reason they cannot go to the doctor of their choice, 
the reason they are frustrated with the American healthcare system 
today, and the reason insurance companies are making billions of 
dollars while they suffer is their Federal Government.
  It is a Federal Government that has overpromised, overregulated, and 
is now telling you precisely what kind of healthcare you can have while 
then enriching insurance companies to administer it for you. You can't 
go to the doctor of your choice. You can't get the healthcare of your 
choice. We don't have robust health savings accounts. We haven't 
empowered you.
  We have empowered bureaucrats in Washington at HHS and bureaucrats at 
CMS who are managing Medicare and managing Medicaid. We have empowered 
insurance bureaucrats. We have empowered corporate cronies. What we 
have not done is empowered you. What we have not done is empowered 
doctors.
  We must do that if we are going to claim the mantle of not just 
healthcare freedom and making America healthy again, but if we are 
going to actually say that we are going to be fiscally responsible, we 
can't solve our $36 trillion of debt if we don't solve the burden of 
healthcare.
  When we get to January, when we are sworn in, when we have counted 
the electors for President Trump, when the Senate is in session, we 
should act with dispatch to pass a reconciliation package right out of 
the gate that secures the border of the United States.

[[Page H6584]]

  It was the fundamental promise of the Trump campaign but, more 
importantly, what President Trump has campaigned on all the way back 
since 2016, what President Trump did while he was in office from 2017 
to 2021.
  It was the fundamental failure of the Biden administration to 
purposefully flood our country with some 10-odd million human beings, 
including criminals, weakening our border, fentanyl, all the dangers 
that have been posed to the American people, including the murders of 
Americans, deaths from fentanyl poisoning, putting the burden on our 
social welfare state and our schools, jails, and hospitals.
  Obligation number one for this Republican Congress is to ensure that 
we secure the border, or at least take step one to secure the border. 
What will that mean?
  Well, we need to build the wall. President Trump ran on building the 
wall in 2016, so let's provide the funding through reconciliation to 
ensure that the wall is built.
  Number two, the wall does no good if you have policies in place that 
allow people to be released into the United States. That is what the 
Biden administration has done, so we must fund and empower ICE to carry 
out the repatriation of millions of individuals who are illegally 
placed into the United States in violation of law, in violation of the 
statute, in violation of parole, in the name of parole, and in the name 
of asylum. These individuals must be removed and repatriated through 
funding to ICE and Border Patrol.
  We need to fund the Migrant Protection Protocols that President Trump 
was using to ensure that Mexico was upholding its end of the bargain 
and not dumping people into our country. We need to pay back the States 
that have had to be on the front lines when our government failed us, 
like Texas, which has spent $12 billion over the last 4 years to stand 
in the breach. Other States also have a claim to having stood up to try 
to secure the border.
  We should impose monthly and annual fees on those who have been 
paroled into the United States and those who have been given notices to 
appear in court. We have to pay for all that. Impose fees. Impose fees 
on applications for work permits. Ensure that welfare benefits only go 
to United States citizens and legal permanent residents and not 
parolees, not asylees, and not people who are illegally present.

  Currently, that is costing us upwards of $160 billion over 10 years. 
Your tax dollars are going to fund welfare benefits for people who have 
been illegally placed into the United States or who illegally came 
here.
  Additionally, let's make Mexico and other bad-actor states pay for 
the wall by imposing a tax on remittances sent by noncitizens here 
abroad.
  Impose taxes or fees on nongovernmental organizations that have been 
taking taxpayer money just to use it against us and move people here 
illegally into the United States.
  Require illegal aliens to cover the cost of background checks.
  Impose fees on aliens who fail to provide approved, unexpired 
identification documents at ports of entry.
  Increase financial penalties for visa overstays.
  Increase fees on student visas to stop the foreign takeover of U.S. 
colleges.
  Beef up 287(g) to allow local law enforcement to collaborate with 
Federal law enforcement to enforce our border security and immigration 
laws.
  These are just some of the things, a pretty exhaustive list, that we 
can do, should do, and must do right out of the gate in January when we 
have the pen. We can do it--and by the way, we can pay for it--and we 
must.
  Let me be clear: For all manners of our choices on reconciliation, we 
will pay for them. We will achieve deficit reduction, not deficit 
increase. That is our calling, and we must achieve it. Failure to do so 
will not succeed.
  We can repeal the expanded Internal Revenue Service funding. I would 
rather pay for Border Patrol agents than to pay for Internal Revenue 
Service agents. There is some $50 billion sitting there. Let's use that 
to secure the border of the United States.
  Let's repeal the student loan policy of the Biden administration in 
which Americans who never went to college or have paid off their 
student loans or don't qualify are paying off the student loans of 
other Americans. Why is that happening?
  My wife's student loan hasn't been paid off. She has now been working 
on it for 20 years, the product of a single mom. She worked her butt 
off to go to school, had debt sitting there. She has been paying it 
down and working hard to pay it down.
  There are thousands, millions of those people in this country who 
have followed the law, done their responsibility, worked hard to pay 
off their student loans. Joe Biden came in and said: Don't worry about 
that. I am going to take from you, and I am going to give to these 
other people.
  End that. That could get us between $100 billion and $270 billion. 
Take that and fund the things we need to do and that the Constitution 
calls for us to do.
  Repeal the SNAP Thrifty Food Plan. Do you know what that was? It was 
a massive expansion done by the stroke of the pen, just like the same 
stroke of the pen that Joe Biden used to expand the student loan 
bailouts, to expand food stamps, effectively, and to walk into just 
continuing to fund the worst form.
  Huge percentages of the food stamps go to sugar drinks and all the 
things that are making us unhealthy, making us obese, and making us 
overweight so that we can then go to pharma, Big Insurance, and big 
hospitals and say: Please save us from ourselves.
  The government subsidizes both. The Federal Government subsidizes the 
poison. The Federal Government subsidizes the overmedication. The 
Federal Government subsidizes the bureaucracy. Guess what? We are all 
worse off because of it, and we are $36 trillion in debt. How about we 
stop doing that?
  Every Member of Congress is going to have some constituency telling 
them why they can't do that. They are going to have somebody saying: If 
you do that, my rural hospital might have a problem. If you do that, my 
local business, my local sugar growers, my local manufacturers--who 
cares? That is not our job.
  Forgive me for channeling ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' but we 
are not supposed to be here to funnel printed money to our local 
districts. We are not. That is not why we are elected. Unfortunately, 
that is why too many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are 
here. Don't do that.
  We could repeal the EPA EV mandate rule. We could save $113 billion 
by stopping the ridiculous rule to mandate that two-thirds of our fleet 
be changed to electric vehicles by 2032. That is absurd.
  If you even converted the entire American fleet today to electric 
vehicles, you would diminish CO<inf>2</inf> production by less than, I 
think, 2 percent, a fraction. I don't even think it is that high. It 
would be a minimal impact, and you can't even do that. Even if we 
wanted to, we couldn't do that.

  Why would we drive up the cost of automobiles, make them less 
reliable, harm the economy, spend money subsidizing something that is 
not going to produce the result that it said it is going to produce, 
all so some people can run around, flying to Davos in their private 
jets, patting themselves on the back, which is precisely what my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle and gasbags like John Kerry 
do.
  I will probably get admonished for that one.
  The fact of the matter is that we have an obligation here in Congress 
to do the job we said we would do. I give this speech, and I give it 
pretty regularly, but I am going to keep giving it because I have to be 
honest with you. This job has its pros and cons. The cons list tends to 
stack up. You are away from your family, and you are traveling and all 
of that, but it is a great honor and a great blessing.
  One of the great blessings is when you are around the country and see 
somebody--or like the woman who I ran into on the street who was 
walking up the street and coming up to the Capitol, who just said: 
Thank you. Thank you for fighting for us. Thank you for giving us a 
voice for sanity.
  The American people just want their country back. Do you want to know 
what the election was about in November? They just want their country 
back. They just want common sense back. They just want sanity.
  Here we are again, sitting here on the eve of passing a National 
Defense Authorization Act, which many of my

[[Page H6585]]

Democratic colleagues are saying they don't want to support because, 
again, we are limiting the use of taxpayer dollars to go to transgender 
surgeries for children.

                              {time}  1745

  We have a defense authorization bill that is something like, I don't 
know, $900 billion to authorize the national defense of the United 
States.
  Now, imagine George Washington and all of those men freezing to 
death. They didn't have socks. They didn't have shoes. They were 
suffering. General Washington thought he was going to lose the Army.
  Fast-forward to Christmas of 1944 and our grandfathers, our great-
grandfathers, some of our fathers were sitting in a foxhole in Bastogne 
freezing to death, and for what?
  For a country that would take taxpayer dollars to fund, through the 
national defense of the United States, the mutilation of children. Now, 
my Democrat colleagues want to hold up the National Defense 
Authorization Act because we dare say that children shouldn't be 
mutilated.
  That is the current Democratic Party. If you want to know why they 
were thrown out on their ear in November, that is why.
  Now we should lead. We should lead farther.
  I heard some rumbling on this side of the aisle that the Speaker 
shouldn't have included that language in the bill. The Speaker was 
exactly right to include that language in the bill. We have an 
obligation in the House of Representatives, the people's House, not to 
punt. I hear my colleagues saying, well, President Trump will come in 
and take care of it.
  I understand that we believe that the policies adopted by the 
President will be much more to our liking.
  But what about your constitutional obligation?
  What about our job?
  What about our use of the power of the purse?
  The United States House of Representatives is supposed to be the 
closest to the people. The people didn't sign up for this. The people 
just want a military that is lethal again. They just want a military 
that is not woke, that isn't going through all sorts of nonsense 
trainings at the academies or at the Pentagon itself. They sure as hell 
don't want their taxpayer dollars going to the mutilation of children.
  Let's not forget that this same National Defense Authorization Act 
will continue to allow and promote the use of taxpayer dollars for 
adult transgender surgeries.
  Mr. Speaker, if we pass this bill, this horrible bill, according to 
our Democratic colleagues that shouldn't have this provision to protect 
children, our great win is to pull back the goalpost from full 
transgender surgeries being funded through our tax dollars through the 
Pentagon to, well, we will just do adults, but not children, we think.
  We will still fund the chief diversity officer, whatever that is and 
whatever value that is providing for the Pentagon. We will still 
continue to authorize all manners of programs. We still have a bill 
that is larded up with conservation programs and all sorts of things, 
it is not just a specific defense bill.
  There are a variety of reasons to oppose this legislation because we 
can do better. It could be more focused on lethality. It can be with 
fewer dollars.
  Our job is to represent the people. It is not to represent the latest 
focus group at Yale University that sit around talking about what woke 
nonsense they want out of our Pentagon, but yet that is what our 
Democrat colleagues are doing.
  We will see what happens tomorrow when we vote on this defense bill. 
I think it is useful for the American people to see precisely the 
values of our radical, progressive Democrat colleagues on this 
particular issue.
  It is incumbent upon Republicans for us to advance the ball, to 
actually shrink the size of government. Don't hide behind DOGE. Don't 
hide behind Elon or Vivek. Don't say: Oh, isn't it great? They are 
going to do all this stuff. They are going to take this stuff in. They 
are going to use AI. They are going to crowdsource. Then what? What?
  They are going to present recommendations to Secretaries. The 
Secretaries will implement some of that stuff. Meanwhile, Congress will 
continue to appropriate. Congress will continue to authorize.
  What will we authorize? What will we appropriate?
  Will it be responsible? Will we shrink the size of the bureaucracy? 
Will we make government more efficient and effective and focus on its 
actual constitutional provisions? Will we address the massive problem 
with the automatic spending that is Medicare, Medicaid, Social 
Security, now increasingly, the Veterans Administration, which is on 
autopilot?
  Mr. Speaker, 70 percent of the budget, 70 percent of what we spend 
every year, is on autopilot, and we don't touch it. My Democrat 
colleagues will say, you are going to push granny off the cliff. My 
Republican colleagues will say, we can't cut discretionary spending 
because we must focus on so-called mandatory, automatic spending. Yet 
then we never have a proposal. We never come to the floor.
  One of my Democratic colleagues was walking by me earlier. I won't 
name this individual lest I get that individual in trouble. I was 
giving an interview and they asked me about whether ObamaCare subsidies 
should be on the chopping block for this round of debates on 
reconciliation later this year in tax policy.
  Now my answer, as someone who opposed the implementation of 
ObamaCare, was to not focus on ObamaCare. My answer was simple: The 
American people deserve robust health savings accounts in which they 
can choose their healthcare, where they are empowered, their doctor is 
empowered, and insurance companies, bureaucrats, hospitals, and pharma 
are not in power.
  This Democratic colleague was walking by and said, hey, I can support 
that. Those are the kinds of conversations, if we want to be serious 
about driving down the cost of healthcare, so we can actually balance 
our budget, that we must have in the context of reconciliation.
  My message to my Republican colleagues is, if you think you are going 
to come in this Chamber and waltz in here and say that we are going to 
pass tax reform, extend the tax cuts without dealing with spending, you 
are mistaken. You are mistaken.

  If K Street wants to come down here and make their case for all of 
the tax provisions they want--and look, there are a lot of small 
businesses and people across America who care strongly about getting 
the tax policies that I agree with that we ought to put in place: 
expensing, research and development, pass-through tax policy. To be 
very clear, tax policy is not going to move off of the House floor 
until we deal with spending.
  We are going to cut spending. We are going to put us on a path to 
balance. We are going to reduce deficits, or I will be an opponent of 
tax policy and many of my colleagues will also because the time is now. 
No more games, no more gimmicks, no more short-term extensions to get a 
political win. This has to end on both sides of the aisle.
  We need to get busy this Congress figuring out how to be fiscally 
responsible, dramatically cutting the bureaucracy, shrinking 
Washington, and empowering Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I am reminded as I wrap up here that Valley Forge was 
not the end of the story for this country when I opened up my remarks 
about General Washington and the suffering of those soldiers under his 
care and watch.
  Those men freezing, starving, and uncertain of the future, not 
knowing what laid in front of them, they didn't give up.
  General Washington wrote in that pre-Christmas letter, ``We have not 
more than 3 months to prepare a great deal of business in--if we let 
these slip or waste, we shall be laboring under the same difficulties 
all next campaign. . . .''
  Washington knew that every low point was a time to prepare, to keep 
moving, to get things in place for the next fight, because those low 
points are where opportunity lives. That is what we can learn from and 
what we have to imitate here.
  We have 4 years to make transformative change or we will squander 
everything that those men at Valley Forge fought for and gave us, all 
those men who fought in the Civil War in the 1860s, all of those men 
who stormed the

[[Page H6586]]

beaches of Normandy and ended up at Bastogne.
  What are we going to have written on our headstone when this fight is 
over? Did we keep and preserve this republic for our kids and our 
grandkids?
  That should be the question that guides everything we do as 
Republicans in charge of this House Chamber going forward.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                      BIDDING FAREWELL TO CONGRESS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Eshoo) for 60 minutes as designee of the minority leader.
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to give valedictory 
remarks as my service as a United States Representative comes to a 
close.
  Nearly 32 years ago, I arrived in this Chamber after the people of 
the most distinguished congressional district in our country gave me 
the honor of a lifetime to serve as their Representative in the 
Congress.
  Over those years, I have worked to live up to that sacred trust that 
they placed in me and I can say that I have given it my all.
  In 1993, I was sworn in as a Member of the largest freshman class 
since World War II with 110 new Members and one of the 47 women elected 
in the House in that ``Year of the Woman.'' I was the first Democrat 
and the first woman in the history of my congressional district to 
represent it.
  During that time, I had the honor to serve among the giants of the 
bay area delegation: Congressman George Miller, Congressman Norm 
Mineta, so many from the bay area known as the conscience of the House 
of Representatives, and my forever Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
  They gave me the guidance I needed to accomplish my goals for my 
first term. In my second term, I became a member of the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee, one of the oldest House legislative committees 
and the committee with the broadest of jurisdictions.
  From that powerful position of enormous privilege, I was determined 
to be an ambassador to the future from the Silicon Valley District, 
drafting and passing 68 bills into law signed by five Presidents.
  I didn't do this alone. Nearly every single bill was bipartisan and 
many had more than 200 cosponsors. I am proud of this body of work and 
what we achieved together.
  During my tenure, I have witnessed much. We have witnessed much 
together: the horror of September 11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
a painful and deep recession, the loss of over a million American souls 
to the pandemic, and January 6th.
  However, there were so many high points: The passage many years ago 
in 1995 of the Telecommunications Act, the Affordable Care Act where 
finally we had a national health plan, a real health plan for the 
American people, the Violence Against Women Act, the end of over 100 
years of silence by the United States with the passage of the Armenian 
genocide resolution, and the election of the first woman Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.

                              {time}  1800

  Each weekend I have flown home to be with my constituents, and I have 
seen the words of the laws that we have written walk into people's 
lives. In my community, as in so many others, Federal grants paved new 
bike paths, created ADA accessibility, and unveiled the 21st century 
transportation system of electric trains.
  I heard from my neighbors about small improvements, like my law many 
years ago to lower the volume of loud TV commercials, and big 
improvements like children whose lives were saved because of new 
pediatric treatments at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
  I am especially proud to have created two new Federal agencies to 
bring lifesaving research to the American people: the Biomedical 
Advanced Research and Development Authority--we call it BARDA--and the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, ARPA-H. That agency is at 
work to pursue the cures for those diseases that are death sentences 
today.
  During my tenure, I had the privilege to serve on the House 
Intelligence Committee, where I worked to protect and defend during the 
challenging times of the Iraq war, and to visit our courageous troops 
in the war zones where they were serving. I still picture them in the 
places that they were, these young men and women who answered the call 
of our country.
  One of the most memorable events, for me, that took place right here 
in this Chamber was the visit of Pope Francis in 2015. I recall his 
words: ``A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as 
Lincoln did; when it fosters a culture which enables people to `dream' 
of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther 
King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the 
oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work. . . .''
  My brother-in-law carries forward that work at the Catholic Worker 
House in Redwood City, California.
  To my staff, you have been a brilliant team, a team that has crafted 
and negotiated the legislative legacy that I am so proud of and who 
have successfully helped thousands upon thousands of constituents with 
immigration issues, housing needs, Social Security benefits, and other 
important Federal issues. You heard them, you saw them, you served 
them, and you gave them hope. I thank you.
  To all who work in this Chamber and throughout the Capitol, cleaning, 
cooking, repairing, and administering, I thank you for your labors.
  To all of my colleagues, I am grateful to you for your friendship and 
your support over all the years. I will miss working with you and 
seeing you every day.
  To my beloved California delegation, to say that I will miss working 
with you and being with you doesn't begin to describe it. Thank you for 
keeping our State the golden one in our country, and I know that you 
will continue to. For your precious friendships, I can never thank you 
enough. To the Connecticut delegation, thank you for adopting me. I was 
born in Connecticut.
  To the people of California's 16th Congressional District, you have 
my unending gratitude for choosing me to be your voice in Congress.
  To my family, thank you for your love, your support, most of all your 
patience. You have sustained me every single day of my service.
  While it may be customary to end these farewell speeches with advice 
or warnings about the future, I am not going to do that.
  What I have carried with me throughout my public service are the 
words of my grandmother. When I was a child and I would walk past her 
bedroom every morning, there wasn't a time that she didn't lean over 
and kiss the ground. When I asked her, ``Nana, why are you doing 
that?'' this was her answer: ``To thank God for this country, for what 
it represents, and what it has given to us.''
  My colleagues, love our country, defend her, make her stronger and 
better to serve its good and decent people.
  I thank God for the blessings that have come to me, and I say 
farewell to all of you, my colleagues. This has been the joy, the 
privilege, and the pleasure of my life, and I thank you for it. May God 
continue to bless the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

     THANKING REPRESENTATIVE CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS FOR HER SERVICE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee 
(Mrs. Harshbarger) for 30 minutes.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in

[[Page H6587]]

which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material 
on the subject of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues here today to 
honor the life and legacy of my good friend, Congresswoman Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers, from the great State of Washington.
  Through her 20 years of service, she has made an incredible impact in 
the Halls of Congress and touched the lives of so many Members who have 
had the privilege of working alongside of her.
  I will begin by just giving my remarks. Mr. Speaker, it has been an 
honor to serve in the Halls for the past few years, but an even greater 
one to do so beside my colleague, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
  Cathy has served in Congress for nearly 20 years, and she has made 
incredible sacrifices, accomplished incredible feats, and dutifully 
served her constituents every step of the way.
  As I have gotten to know Cathy, I have learned that she leads with a 
servant's heart. It is her incredible affinity for helping others that 
has allowed her to find success and accomplish so much during her time 
here. She never sought the spotlight or the prestigious position she 
held in Congress for her own gain, but did so because of her colleagues 
who encouraged and trusted her.
  She has paved the way for countless women in the GOP, inspiring us 
with her leadership, wisdom, and dedication, and she has achieved some 
of the highest levels of success, become a beloved friend to countless 
colleagues, and in my opinion, leaves us 20 years too soon.
  Thank you, Cathy, for everything you have done for us. I might add, I 
am going to miss our prayer time, and I am going to miss walking around 
the Capitol praying for our Nation and just the incredible mentor you 
have been to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), 
our new chairman of Energy and Commerce.
  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and dear 
colleague, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, for her service to our country and 
the committee, everything that she did with the committee, and the way 
it affected our Conference, this Congress, and this country.
  First and foremost, I have been honored to serve with Cathy, our 
chair for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, for more than 10 
years, the last 4 years as our leader. What an outstanding job she has 
done. Under her leadership, we have worked together on healthcare 
policy. She put her faith in me to make me the subcommittee chair for 
the Health Subcommittee.
  By doing that, I was able to gain expertise. I am a manufacturing guy 
by background, and I really dug in and learned healthcare and learned 
other parts of the committee. As I think my good friend from Tennessee 
just said, I was honored by the selection to follow her in her 
wonderful footsteps. I have big shoes to fill, and I look forward to 
having the opportunity to do so.
  Under her leadership, we took on some difficult things. She has 
fought to force the sale of TikTok, something that is really hurting 
all our youth and a lot of people in our country, in a way that the 
court has said works. She took a while to do it, but she wanted to make 
sure it was right. She wanted to ensure that people have access to 
TikTok, people can use TikTok. She did not ban TikTok. All she said was 
a foreign adversary cannot own this type of business in our country.
  Thank you for your leadership and for what you do, but more 
importantly, thanks for your friendship.
  When my friend from Tennessee talks about prayerful leadership, that 
is absolutely the case. When the chair says, I am praying for you, you 
know that she is, and it is really heartfelt.
  Not only do I get the opportunity to follow in your great, great 
path, but I also get to continue to follow you and your young and 
beautiful family.
  What I always say, what happens in this House affects people in their 
homes. Congress is a snapshot of America, and our chair is a fantastic 
wife and mother. The experiences in her home I know she brings here, 
and it affects families across this country because of her leadership.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. Tonko).
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and pleasure to say thank you, 
Cathy, and to wish you well. I know there was much celebrating when you 
were named chair, breaking that barrier, becoming the first woman to 
lead Energy and Commerce.
  As we know, we just heard from our colleague, Anna Eshoo, that there 
is this breadth and depth to the committee that enables us to serve 
people in so many ways on so many issues. On behalf of the Democrats in 
the House, I thank you for the opportunities you presented to work 
together to do a lot of legislation and certainly to effect policy in 
the realm of energy and environment, which have been strong points for 
the committee and certainly of particular interest for me.
  I do appreciate all the work on the challenged, the differently 
abled, the people in our society who teach us much by their daily walks 
in life. I know your son is an inspiration to you. Thank you for 
carrying the torch for legislation that enables people to showcase 
their abilities, to be able to be included in a very powerful way. It 
is a lifesaving, life-changing opportunity that we can present the 
given community. I thank you for that forcefulness.
  Personally speaking, thank you for the assistance on the medication-
assisted treatment effort, the MAT Act, which will, in my opinion, save 
lives as we enable people to prescribe for those who are struggling and 
living with the illness of addiction. That is going to be a major 
difference for so many people that we will never ever meet. That is the 
joy and I think the soulfulness of this job, where we are able to 
assist those who will be here in this universe well after we have gone 
or people who live here and share the moment with us but that we will 
never meet. Those are great opportunities for us to express in 
compassionate measure making a difference on behalf of individuals who 
have deep challenges each and every day in life.

  Thank you also for the efforts on bringing together, with our side, 
with Ranking Member Pallone, to be able to do the Parkinson's bill. 
There are 1 million people in this country who live with Parkinson's, 
and the fact that we are able to provide for an effort, an all-out 
effort, a collaborative effort with agencies in the Federal Government, 
working with clinicians, patients, and caregivers to make a difference, 
to make certain that we focus on a cure, better, earlier prognoses, and 
better treatments. These are measures that will really speak to the 
dignity of the individual and deliver hope to the doorsteps of so many 
people who struggle with that illness.
  There are countless achievements. I know you will leave here with 
your heart filled with opportunities that presented themselves where 
you were able to deliver. On behalf of this side of the aisle, I say 
thank you. I am sure we haven't heard or seen the last of you. I wish 
you well as you go into the next phase of life.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Cammack).
  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and 
friend from the great State of Tennessee for yielding to me.
  Tonight we gather to honor and bid farewell to an extraordinary 
leader and friend, Energy and Commerce Chairwoman Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers. Tonight we say good-bye, as she concludes her remarkable 
tenure in Congress. Serving under her leadership on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee has truly been a privilege and an honor.

                              {time}  1815

  I first met Cathy when I was a chief of staff. It was 2013, and I 
came to meet with her as she was the Conference chair at the time. I 
was shaking I was so intimidated, and I just remember she exuded a cool 
calmness, an openness, and, most importantly, a warmth that was 
immediately putting me at ease. As someone who was brand new to the 
Hill, someone who was a very young woman at the time who didn't know 
much of anything, she still made me feel like my opinion mattered. That 
is one of her many gifts.

[[Page H6588]]

  Fast forward as a Member of Congress with the honor and privilege to 
serve here, I will never forget the night that I was in the Cloakroom 
and Cathy comes up to me and says, Kat, I think you would be good for 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am shaking and intimidated like, 
holy crap, the chairwoman is asking me to serve on the best damn 
committee in Congress.
  It was her faith in me that really gave me an insight into how she 
would be as a leader, as someone who we would look to as we navigated 
some of the toughest pieces of legislation and controversial issues.
  I later recall, after having joined the committee, attending a speech 
where she was asked by the moderator to give her life story. Any Member 
of Congress will start spouting off that I was born here, I did this, 
and I am that. No. Cathy stopped, and she said, I will give you my life 
story and who I am in 10 words. She used the following words to 
describe her commitment to service, who she was, who she is: a pioneer, 
trailblazer, leader, working mom of three, wife, ability advocate, and 
trust builder.
  In my time serving with her, I have learned that not only does she 
embrace these words, but she lives them every single day.
  As a pioneer and trailblazer, she is the first woman to lead the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, paving the way for many others to 
follow. She has forged paths in policy areas that were complex, 
controversial, tough, but, most importantly, critical to saving our 
Nation's future.
  As a leader, she was a unifying force and continues to unify within 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. She has an exceptional ability to 
bring together Members with diverse viewpoints--which as we know here 
in Congress, there are many--ensuring that everyone has that feeling of 
being valued and also being heard.
  As a wife and mother, she has balanced the responsibilities of public 
service and motherhood, which we all know is no easy task. She has 
managed it with grace and unwavering dedication.
  As an ability advocate, she has been an unwavering voice for those 
with disabilities, advocating for policies that promote inclusion and 
opportunity, knowing the experience firsthand. We expect to see Cole on 
this House floor in many, many more years to come. He is going to be 
here.
  As a trust builder, her honesty, transparency, and commitment to 
doing what is right have earned her respect in every single room that 
she has entered.
  Chairwoman Rodgers' legacy in Congress will continue to inspire us 
all. I thank her for her service, her leadership, and her example. We 
wish her every success and happiness in the future.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bilirakis).
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk about my good friend, 
an outstanding leader, Chairwoman Rodgers. We are going to miss her. I 
am glad we can gather today, actually this evening, to recognize the 
outstanding leadership of Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers.
  For the last 4 years, she has been an inspiring partner, leading 
priorities on our side of the aisle to protect consumers from harm, 
hold the administration accountable for regulatory overreach, and save 
children from the mental health crisis of the online generation.
  This leadership is best exemplified in the work done to ban Chinese 
access to Americans' personal data and national security information, 
starting with the divestiture of TikTok from the Chinese Communist 
Party.
  Throughout her tenure, Chair Rodgers' tenacity to fight for the 
people is a trait that should be emulated by us all. It is this 
determination that has served a great service to our committee and our 
country.
  While Chair Rodgers returns to Washington State as a constituent to 
her successor, she does so having improved the lives of Americans, and 
she should be proud of the work achieved under her leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, this is an outstanding individual, what a role model and 
great statesperson. We are going to miss her. She has helped me in so 
many different ways over the years, first as Conference chair and as 
chair of the best committee in the House of Representatives. I will 
always be grateful to her. I thank her, and God bless her.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West 
Virginia (Mrs. Miller).
  Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
  During the time I have known Cathy, I have admired her hard work and 
the devotion that she has toward her constituents and upholding her 
conservative values. Mostly, I admire her love of God. She is a light 
to all who meet her.
  I have always looked forward to her leadership along with my other 
wonderful colleagues during our weekly morning prayers with Speaker   
Mike Johnson in his office.
  Cathy has achieved so much throughout her political career. She 
served in the Washington House of Representatives before coming to 
Congress. She has introduced key pieces of legislation, built 
bipartisan relationships, and ensured that the interests of her 
constituents and the American people are all looked out for.
  Cathy will be sorely missed, but I also know that she will continue 
to go on and do amazing things for others. Good luck to her, and God 
bless her.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I don't know where to begin. I think of 
Chair Cathy Rodgers as a friend. I truly mean that. We use that term a 
lot, but in her case, it is truly true. I consider her a real friend.
  The other thing I wanted to say is that you hear me a lot on the 
floor and in the committee talking about how I often blame Republicans 
for being in the pocket or somehow beholden to corporate interests, to 
big corporations, to the wealthy. Forgive me for saying that tonight 
because I do say it a lot, but I have to say it is never the case with 
her. She has a set of values that I don't know if it is just her, it is 
from eastern Washington, or what it is, but she is always looking out 
for what I call the little guy, particularly the children.
  You never get the impression with Cathy that she is here because she 
wants to cater to some special interest group or somebody who is 
wealthy. She is always looking out for the average person in a way 
that--I am not saying there aren't other Republicans that do that; of 
course, there are, many who are on the floor tonight--but there is 
something very special about the fact that she always looks out for the 
little guy. Everything that she does is oriented to trying to help the 
average American and not thinking about any trade association or 
lobbying association, at least from what I have seen.
  I know she was a trailblazer. The very first day she walked in, I 
said I guess I always had hoped that somehow the Democrats would have 
the first chairwoman--not that I would want anybody to replace me as 
chairman or ranking member--but the fact that she was the first woman 
chair as a Republican I thought was rather significant, not only that 
she was the first chair but also that she is a Republican and in that 
capacity as the first chair.
  Our committee has this tradition of being bipartisan. It is easy to 
say, but it is not always easy to make sure it happens because it is 
very easy in the way things are today with the media, social media, 
whatever, for us all to digress into shouting matches, hollering at 
each other, and saying bad things about each other.
  Cathy would never let that happen. Oftentimes, if it was going to 
happen at a hearing or a markup, she would come over to me, or if she 
was sitting next to me, she would say: Look, what can we do to kind of 
calm this down so people don't go after each other?
  We maintained not only bipartisanship when we can but also dignity 
and respect for each other. There were many occasions when, if it 
wasn't for the fact that she was willing to step in and do that with my 
help, we would have digressed into the kind of the law of the jungle or 
whatever you want to call it.

[[Page H6589]]

  I know a lot has been said tonight about the legislation that she 
shepherded through. I missed part of it in the beginning, but a lot of 
it was significant. In all honesty, the nuclear package--we were at the 
White House, I guess in the summer, when the President signed the 
nuclear package. That wasn't easy. There are a lot of people who are 
opposed to nuclear energy, even the President himself in the past has 
often been against nuclear energy. We managed, through her efforts, to 
get that bill passed on a bipartisan basis. It was a major achievement.
  Other bills that I think were very significant was the hospital 
transparency bill. We call it that, but it actually went way beyond 
hospitals. It dealt with PBMs. It dealt with insurance companies. It 
dealt with so many other things. Again, this goes back to, I think, her 
championing the idea that if we pass legislation where people can sort 
of be empowered themselves to do things, that that works. That is what 
that bill was all about. We haven't passed the Senate, but we will get 
it passed at some point.
  It was the idea that we would empower the consumer, the individual, 
or the group to actually be able to do comparison shopping, create 
competition, which is the American way, to create that competition. I 
think that was, again, to her credit that she championed this, made it 
bipartisan, and it passed out of our committee and also passed the 
floor of the House.
  I have to say, Cathy, that many times you would bring up China.
  Oftentimes, we would have a hearing and she would start going after 
not China per se, but Beijing, Communist China. I would often laugh and 
say: Here we go again. She is going to talk about Beijing and the 
Communist Party in China.
  The fact of the matter is, I agreed with her. I mean, I do think that 
the biggest threat that we face is from Beijing, from China, 
militarily. In terms of trade, the competition is there. That 
culminated in the TikTok bill and the data brokers legislation, which I 
know is still being challenged in the courts, but it seems like we are 
doing pretty good.
  That was a recognition of the fact that the Communist Party in China 
was really out to spread misinformation and lead us down a path that 
was contrary and dangerous to our national security.
  I would laugh when she talked about the Communist Party in China, but 
I agreed with her. I totally agreed with her every time she talked 
about it because it is absolutely true. There is no question about it.
  I know another bill that we didn't have complete success on was data 
privacy, but again, that goes back to her caring about kids. I remember 
when she had all of her children. I often wondered: How is she going to 
do this? How is she going to have all these kids while she is in 
Congress? How is she going to have these children and how is she going 
to continue to be a leader? She was head of the Conference, I think, 
part of the time, but she just managed to do it all.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. Speaker, she managed to be the mother, to be the example for 
women as a mother, as a leader in politics, and as a legislator. I 
don't know how you did it, but you did manage to do it all.
  Of course, when we talk about data privacy, a lot of that was her 
concern for social media and how it is negatively influencing kids.
  I think you felt the same way about fentanyl and the drugs and how 
young people were being hooked on fentanyl and other drugs and that we 
had to do something about it. We have done some things about it in my 
opinion.
  I thank you, Cathy. I don't want to keep going on. I know there are 
others who want to speak.
  Thank you, Cathy. Thank you to your husband, Brian, your three kids, 
Cole, Grace, and Brynn, who basically sacrificed a lot while you were 
here. I know you want to get back to them and to eastern Washington, 
which you love so dearly.
  I also thank Nate, Sarah, and the entire team. They not only made it 
possible for her to accomplish what she did but they really loved her, 
too. That showed, as well.
  We are going to miss you. I know we are going to see you again and 
hopefully see you often.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Thank you, Ranking Member Pallone.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).
  Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the outgoing 
chairwoman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers, on an extraordinary career in public service.
  As a leader of the most powerful committee in Congress, Cathy has 
stood out as a dedicated public servant and a tireless champion for the 
children.
  Under her leadership, we have advanced policies that uplift American 
families and inspire a new era of innovation. Her commitment to service 
and her vision for a brighter future have left a lasting mark on this 
institution.
  Back home in eastern Washington, she is known simply as a humble 
public servant and a dedicated voice for her constituents.
  Cathy has served the people of Washington's Fifth Congressional 
District with grace and dedication for 20 years, and she leaves behind 
a legacy of selflessness and service.
  As she embarks on her next chapter, I extend my best wishes to Cathy, 
as well and my heartfelt gratitude to her husband, Brian, and her 
children for their unwavering support of her and her work.
  Thank you, Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers, for your exceptional 
leadership.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. Moore).
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in 
celebrating the time we got to spend with our colleague, Chairwoman 
McMorris Rodgers.
  I can sum this up in one thought, and this is what I will take. The 
best part of this place is we get to interact with some of our 
colleagues and learn from others. What I will take going forward was 
what she exemplified, and that was being a well-rounded person.
  When you talked to her, you could dive deep on all of the policy 
matters that go on in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. You could 
also dig in and learn about her experience leading the Republican 
Conference with her efforts on messaging.
  More importantly, what she always loved to talk about was being a 
mother to amazing children, some of which I have had a chance to meet 
and been inspired by, as well. She and her husband have lived and will 
continue to live a life of service.
  She is somebody who doesn't just talk about reading the Bible. She 
lives it. This is somebody who isn't narrowly focused on one aspect of 
life. She embraces a well-rounded way to live and touch as many people 
as possible, and that is what I will learn and continue to take from 
her example.
  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. Bishop).
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
dedicated public servant, loving wife, mother, and a distinguish Member 
of this body, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and to share the 
story of our work together on behalf of America's military families.
  In 2009, we founded the Congressional Military Family Caucus. Every 
year since then, we hosted a summit, alternating between Fairchild Air 
Force Base and Fort Moore, which gives the members of America's Armed 
Forces, their spouses, and their children an opportunity to hear from 
the Department of Defense leaders and subject-matter experts, as well 
as share their families' experiences and challenges.
  The caucus has brought to the forefront and tackled numerous issues 
such as food insecurity, medical care, spousal employment, family 
relocation challenges, childcare, and so much more.
  I have especially been inspired by her advocacy on behalf of 
individuals with disabilities, her dedication to our veterans and 
military families, and her commitment to statesmanship and 
bipartisanship in the United States Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I join all of my colleagues in commending Congresswoman 
Cathy McMorris Rodgers for her dedicated service to the American 
people. While we will greatly miss her leadership on Capitol Hill, we 
wish her and her family the best as she embarks upon the next chapter 
of her life.

  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

         RECOGNIZING RETIRING U.S. REP. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Tonko) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my friend, Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers.
  From taking on TikTok, as we have talked about, to boosting America's 
energy strategy, Chairwoman Rodgers has been our fearless leader for 
the last 4 years on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and as 
Conference chair before that.
  I am most thankful for her commitment to taking care of our Nation's 
children, all our children. Through her efforts on kids' online privacy 
and safety, as well as on improving health outcomes for babies, 
children, and mothers, her passion and hard work have never wavered.
  We are sad to see her go but wish her God's richest blessings in her 
next stage of life, for it is God who guided her good and principled 
representation of those she served.
  The State of Washington and her family are lucky to have her back. 
Maybe I would change that from lucky to blessed to have her back full 
time.
  Thank you, Madam Chair, for your years of service to this country, 
the committee, the God you serve, and Members like me who so 
appreciated your leadership. God bless you.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Allen).
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand here tonight with my 
colleagues to recognize Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers and her 
remarkable service to the United States Congress.
  When she was elected to Congress, Cathy was a Member of our 
leadership team, serving as the chair of the House Republic Conference. 
In the 115th Congress, she led our Conference's messaging machine as we 
delivered historic results for the American people including the best 
economy in our lifetime.
  Additionally, I have learned a great deal from Cathy's leadership on 
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce this Congress as she helped 
each Member fulfill our promises to reclaim American energy dominance, 
expand clean power generation, and improve transparency in our Nation's 
healthcare system.
  Above all else, I have cherished sharing our faith and fellowship 
during LEAD House over these past years.
  Your love of God and family and devotion to your Christian values is 
something we will miss in the next Congress. I am proud to call you my 
sister in the faith.
  May God bless you and your family as you embark on your next season 
in life. Sister, I love you dearly.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. 
Houchin).
  Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate my 
friend, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a dedicated leader whose two decades of 
service to Washington's Fifth Congressional District and our Nation 
have been truly exceptional.
  If I only had one word to describe Cathy, it would be trailblazer, 
and many people have said that yet tonight. She has been a great 
example of how it is possible to balance a demanding career in public 
service, while also being committed to her family.
  She was the 200th woman elected to Congress, the first female chair 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the first woman to have 
three children while serving in Congress. She embodies grace and 
resilience. She is kind and caring. She always desires to help others 
achieve success.
  Quite frankly, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is one of the driving reasons I 
stand in this Chamber today. Thank you.
  Those are not the only reasons or the only qualities that make her 
stand out. Her leadership as chair of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce has been transformative. She has led efforts to advance energy 
security, promote healthcare innovation, and build a stronger, more 
competitive economy.
  We could go on and on tonight on her policy success. She has been a 
champion for rural communities, small businesses, and families. She has 
advocated for policies that reflect the values of the American people. 
Her legacy is one of tireless advocacy, principled leadership, and a 
deep commitment to improving the lives of others.
  It has been an honor to serve alongside Cathy and witness the 
incredible impact she has made while serving in Congress. While it is 
bittersweet and the Conference will miss her, we are overjoyed that she 
will spend more time with her beloved family, with Brian, Cole, Grace, 
and Brynn.
  Cathy, best wishes and congratulations. Thank you for your guidance 
and friendship. You have shown us all what true servant leadership 
looks like.

  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman (Ms. Tenney) from 
of New York.
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from New York, 
Mr. Tonko. I really appreciate this honor.
  Mr. Speaker, you have heard so many wonderful things about our 
outgoing chairwoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, or, as we like to call 
her, CMR. That is who she was when I first came into Congress.
  As you know, she served 20 years. She served honorably. She is an 
incredible mother. She has championed so many great policies.
  I would just like to say I call Cathy McMorris Rodgers a friend. I 
have to say this from my heart. I have never met another person on 
Earth who represents the godly qualities so important to serving in 
public office. She is honest, she has integrity, she has compassion, 
and she has charity. Those things are very rare, and she is going to be 
so missed with those qualities.
  She is also a true friend. True friends are hard to come by in 
Washington, D.C. She is one of those people who stands with you 
honestly and confidentially throughout the difficult times, throughout 
your good times.
  I am so grateful to Cathy McMorris Rodgers for everything she has 
done for me as a leader, everything she has done for our Nation, and 
the State of Washington.
  Another really important part of Cathy McMorris Rodgers that I am 
really going to miss is her son, Cole, who has been a dear friend of 
mine here when he comes to visit us in Washington. Cole has become a 
great friend and a wonderful inspiration for me. I know he inspires so 
many of us here in Congress and especially Cathy and her family.
  When Cole was here last, I was a little agitated about a couple of 
things. I got a little anxious. Cole said: Chill out.
  I think that is what Cathy will do when she retires next year. She is 
going to chill out for a little while. She will never stop serving our 
country, her State, our Nation, our world, her family, and our God.
  We are so grateful to you and for having you here. It has been a 
complete blessing to know you.
  There is never a better friend that I have ever met than Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers, our beloved CMR.
  I wish you and your family the best. You really are one in a billion, 
one in several billion on Earth. We thank you so much. Congratulations 
and thank you so much for your really honorable, wonderful service to 
our community.

                              {time}  1845

  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Weber).
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York 
for yielding, and I thank Congresswoman Harshbarger for doing this for 
us and for Cathy.
  Mr. Speaker, Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers exemplifies principled 
leadership. As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, she has 
championed--you have heard about them--the policies that protect 
American families, secure energy independence, and foster innovation.
  Her deep commitment to her faith, her family, and the cause of 
freedom has been a guiding light, and her presence will undoubtedly 
leave a void here in Washington.

[[Page H6591]]

  I want to give you a personal insight from Randy Weber. She was the 
conference chair, I don't know, 4 years ago maybe, and she got some 
opposition when she was going to run for conference chair, from a 
woman. It was going to be a little tough. It was going to be a little 
tough on the Republican Conference, the Republican Members of Congress.
  Cathy very graciously stepped down and said she would not run, which 
left the seat open for the lady that did get the Republican Conference 
chair. That just shows that she has grace and she cared more about the 
conference than she cared about herself.
  Her deep commitment to her faith, her family, and the cause of 
freedom has been that kind of guiding light and undoubtedly is going to 
leave that void I talked about.
  Under Cathy's leadership, I have watched this committee tackle 
critical issues from affordable energy to healthcare challenges, making 
our Nation stronger.
  I was involved with about three Bible studies, and then I found out 
that Cathy McMorris Rodgers had one on Wednesday morning at 7 a.m. I 
said I am going to start going to that Bible study if she will let me. 
Unfortunately for her, she did. She let me in. I have watched her grow. 
I have watched her lead and pray for the Nation and pray for our 
friends on both sides of the aisle.
  Cathy's dedication to America, Washington's Fifth District, and her 
colleagues, all I can say to them and to us is that we have walking 
among our midst--if you read the Bible, book of Proverbs, chapter 31, 
we have a virtuous woman.
  Cathy, we are going to miss you in these Halls, but we are grateful 
that you were here. In the words of our Lord: Well done, thy good and 
faithful servant.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
Lee).
  Ms. LEE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honor to be here, to 
get to recognize such an exemplary Member of Congress.
  Cathy McMorris Rodgers does all of the things that you could hope a 
Member of Congress would do, and she does them with integrity and 
incredible skill. She leads on policy, tackling some of the most 
challenging issues of our time. She is completely unafraid to confront 
an issue because it is complicated or because it is a political 
challenge. If it is the right thing to do, she will stand behind it and 
she has. She has been an example to all of us in that way.
  Equally important, she is an example to us of the type of person and 
the type of Member that we should all aspire to be. She is a spiritual 
leader to so many in Congress.
  You have heard mentioned already tonight not just of one Bible study 
but of numerous, because she ensures that she meets Members where they 
are and that each of us has an opportunity to have a friend, a partner, 
somebody to walk with in our own spiritual journey as we are here. That 
is so vital to this place and our relationships with one another.
  Everyone who knows her knows that she cares about her home and her 
family, and she is also an example to so many of us that we don't have 
to sacrifice that in order to serve here.
  When I was thinking about running for Congress and before I had 
decided whether I could, she was one of the people who stopped what she 
was doing to talk to me. She shared with me the story of her family and 
how she managed to do both this, to be a good, strong Member fighting 
for good policy and for her constituents, but also to remain a wife, a 
mother, a servant of God, and that all of those things could, in fact, 
be done at once. She made the case that, in fact, it was necessary to 
have people in this place who were willing to try to do all of those 
things well at the same time.
  There is no other person who I can think of who has done more to 
reach out, support, mentor, and help particularly new women who are 
Members of Congress. She has shown the way to do this and to do it 
well.
  I am so happy for her, for her family, for the people back home who 
get to have her more often. I will tell you this, for those of us who 
stay here in Washington, D.C., she will be dearly, dearly missed.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. 
Fulcher).
  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my colleague and good 
friend, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
  As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Congresswoman Rodgers 
not only delivered results for the American people but she helped me 
secure wins for Idahoans.
  Among many things, I am thankful for her commitment to boosting 
liquefied natural gas capacity in Idaho and the Northwest, for support 
of my bill to expand broadband solutions in rural Idaho, for her work 
in cracking down on China's surveillance of Americans' data, and for 
providing me with the opportunity to support building out the nuclear 
workforce, along with advancing legislation to issue a warning label on 
mobile apps owned by Communist China.
  It has been such a privilege to serve alongside such a respected and 
impactful leader. I join many in expressing my support and 
encouragement to you, Cathy, as you move forward to this next chapter 
of life.

  Most importantly, and my bottom-line message is, Washington State, 
the United States of America, and the United States Congress is all 
better because of you.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I believe that leaves the individual of focus 
this evening, the chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
Rodgers).
  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, as I rise here tonight, yes, 
my heart is overflowing with gratitude. To all my colleagues, I thank 
you. I thank you for your friendship and your support. What an amazing 
institution the United States House of Representatives is.
  Part of my mission has been to restore trust and confidence in this 
institution because I believe it is so important in our Nation.
  To my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and beyond, it 
really is great to be with you tonight.
  What an amazing journey for me, a farm kid, growing up and working 
alongside my brother and parents at our orchard and fruit stand in 
Kettle Falls, Washington, to walking the Halls of Congress, being 
elected the 200th woman ever to serve in this institution, and 
ultimately as the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
  I have truly lived the American Dream.
  To the people of eastern Washington, thank you. Thank you for putting 
your trust in me to be your voice in Congress for the past 20 years. 
Each person that I have met along the way influenced and inspired me in 
ways that I couldn't imagine. Serving you has been the honor of my 
life.
  I also want to thank my family. I couldn't have done it without my 
amazing, loving, and supportive husband, Brian, who has been by my side 
the last 18 years, at least. He said carrying the load at home was 
harder than anything he ever did in the Navy in his 26 years there.
  Thank you, Brian. You are the love of my life and the man of my 
dreams.
  To our beloved, beautiful children, Cole McMorris Rodgers, now 17; 
Grace Blossom Rodgers, 14; and Brynn Catherine Rodgers, 11: You are the 
greatest blessings of my life. We are so proud, and I can't wait to be 
home with you.
  I thank my mom, Corene McMorris, for being my fierce defender against 
all who dare accuse me of anything wrong; my stepdad, Vern White, for 
his embracing of this journey.
  I thank my brother, Jeff McMorris, who managed my first campaign for 
Congress in 2004. It was there that he renewed his acquaintance with 
and fell in love with my sister-in-law, Sarah, an amazing woman who 
also dedicated much of her time and energy to helping me win.
  I thank my nieces and nephew, Kate, Reagan, Conner, and Halle, who I 
adore for joining me on the campaign trail.
  I thank my dad, Wayne McMorris, who impressed everyone as my sign 
chairman back in 2004, blanketing the Fifth Congressional District with 
red, white, and blue ``Cathy for Congress'' signs.
  Brian's family also joined in the fun, as well as so many, many 
friends and supporters.

[[Page H6592]]

  What an honor and privilege it has been for me to represent all of 
you.
  To my team, words cannot express my gratitude for the hundreds of 
brilliant men and women who have served alongside me here in my 
congressional office and on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and back 
home in my district and campaign offices. While it was always my name 
on the door, it was your dedication that helped me succeed and deliver 
results.
  Together, we have fun while we SERVE--Seek excellence, Everybody 
matters, Responsibly own it, Vigilant integrity, and Embrace change. It 
made all the difference.
  Although I would like to give each one of you a shout-out by name, I 
thank the leadership, various chiefs of staff, and district directors 
beginning with Connie Partoyan, Jeremy Deutsch, David Condon, David 
Peluso, Jared Powell, Kyle VonEnde, Karli Plucker, Dick Leland, Chud 
Wendle, Traci Couture, Patrick Bell, Kristina Sabestinas, Dawn Sugasa, 
Nate Hodson, and Sarah Burke, who helped me navigate the mighty waters, 
the many highs and lows, and the disappointments and crowning 
achievements of my time in Congress.
  Most of all, I am grateful to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who 
lovingly drew me closer to him over the past 20 years. He has spoken to 
me about his mercies that are new each morning, and he has poured out 
his grace on me and my family.
  As I leave Congress, I urge all of us to look for ways to cultivate 
more grace, love, and forgiveness in this world and serve others. We 
hope for a time of healing.
  Alexis de Tocqueville said it so well. He said: ``America is great 
because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America 
will cease to be great.''
  I have served with so many good people and had the honor of 
representing the good people of eastern Washington. For that, I am 
grateful. I say thank you, may God bless you, and may God continue to 
bless the United States of America.
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                          HONORING KAY GRANGER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Weber) for 30 minutes.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and to submit extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heart full of 
gratitude and admiration to honor my dear friend and colleague, 
Representative Kay Granger, a true Texas legend whose retirement marks 
the end of an extraordinary era in this House.
  Kay Granger is not just a trailblazer. She is absolutely a Texas 
institution. From her early days as the first woman to serve as the 
mayor of Fort Worth, to pave the way as the first Republican woman from 
the State of Texas to serve in Congress, to her historic tenure here in 
Congress serving Texas' 12th Congressional District, Kay Granger has 
embodied the values that Texans hold dear.

                              {time}  1900

  Kay Granger has embodied the values that Texans hold dear. Mr. 
Speaker, those values would happen to be faith, fortitude, and an 
absolute unwavering commitment to doing what is right.
  As chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee where she made 
history becoming that, Kay demonstrated unparalleled leadership in 
guiding one of the most critical responsibilities for Congress, and 
that would be overseeing the power of the purse.
  Mr. Speaker, Kay Granger's wisdom and steady hand have ensured that 
our appropriations process prioritized the need of the American people 
while safeguarding the principles of limited government.
  I have had the privilege of serving along with Kay in the Texas 
delegation for the past 11 years, Mr. Speaker, and let me tell you, she 
has been nothing short of extraordinary. In Texas we say: You done 
good.
  The Texas row on the House floor will not be the same without her. 
Kay has been an absolute cornerstone of our Texas delegation, a voice 
we have relied on, a leader we have admired, and a friend we have 
cherished.
  Kay's leadership on the House Appropriations Committee and her 
ability to get things done have moved the needle in a giant Texas way, 
and not just for Texas, but for the entire country.
  Kay, your dedication to service has truly been a blessing to this 
Congress and to every Texan who has had the honor of calling you their 
Representative. You have made Texas proud, Kay Granger, and we are all 
better for having worked alongside you.
  Kay, please know this: as you head into retirement, you are leaving a 
legacy that will surely stand the test of time. We hope you get to 
enjoy that retirement in the greatest State in the Nation, the one and 
only Lone Star State.
  Let me reiterate, Kay, thank you for your friendship, for your 
leadership, and your unwavering commitment to the values we hold dear.
  God bless you, Kay. May He continue to hold you and continue to guide 
you in this next chapter.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran).
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the eve of her retirement to 
honor Chairwoman Kay Granger for her many years of dedicated work on 
behalf of Texans everywhere and our entire country.
  For nearly three decades, Chairwoman Granger has tirelessly served 
the 12th Congressional District of Texas. For many of us, she has been 
a valued mentor, and, more importantly, a respected friend. As the most 
senior member of the Texas Republican delegation, her experience, 
wisdom, and leadership have been a valuable resource. In fact, they 
have been invaluable.
  Chairwoman Granger has been a true trailblazer, and her legacy will 
not be soon forgotten. Her time in public service has been marked by 
many firsts. She served as the first female mayor of Fort Worth, the 
first Republican Congresswoman from Texas, and the first female 
Republican to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
  Over the years, Chairwoman Granger has left a lasting impact on the 
Dallas/Fort Worth area, our great State of Texas, and our Nation as a 
whole. She has worked tirelessly to advocate for her constituents and 
to advance policies and improve the lives of both Texans and Americans 
everywhere.
  She has successfully secured funding for many worthy local funding 
projects in Fort Worth, increased local and national defense spending 
to protect the American people, and kept a close eye on overall Federal 
spending. Her contributions to preserving our national security and 
supporting economic growth will not soon be forgotten.
  Chairwoman Granger, thank you for setting the standard in our mission 
to represent the great people of Texas. Your leadership is a testament 
to the strength of the Texas spirit, and your work will have a lasting 
impact for generations to come. We have truly been blessed by your 
leadership, dedication, and service, but, most of all, your friendship.
  Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Williams).
  Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
career and accomplishments of my lifelong friend, Kay Granger. We both 
shared Fort Worth as our hometown.
  Throughout the years, I have watched her lead in the classroom, on 
the city council as mayor, as a Congresswoman, and as chairwoman. She 
can make a deal, she can close a deal, and she has no problem making a 
decision and sticking with it. Her word is her bond, and to her, a 
handshake means something. She has truly lived a life worth being 
copied.
  To my friend and colleague, Kay, thank you for your friendship and 
thank you for your leadership.
  May God bless you, and in God we trust.

[[Page H6593]]

  

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Ellzey).
  Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor someone who has been a 
mentor, a trailblazer, and a dear friend, Congresswoman Kay Granger.
  Kay's story is the kind of Texas story all of us Texans admire. She 
spent her entire life serving others, and she has done it with the kind 
of grit and determination that defines what we like to think about when 
thinking about Texas. From her days as a schoolteacher to becoming the 
mayor of Fort Worth and now serving right here in this Chamber, Miss 
Kay has poured her heart and soul into every role she has taken on. She 
has led with strength, wisdom, and a deep love for people she 
represents.
  As the first Republican woman to chair the Appropriations Committee, 
Kay broke barriers and made history. There have only been about 11,000 
people who have served in this Chamber, but Miss Kay is one of one.
  If you know Kay, then you know she didn't do it for the accolades, 
she didn't do it to break barriers, and she didn't do it to break the 
grass ceiling. She did it because she believed in getting things done; 
and, boy, did she ever. From standing up for our military and veterans 
to ensuring that north Texas communities got the resources they needed, 
she has left a mark that will be felt for generations.

  On a personal level, Kay has been a guidepost for me. From day one 
she has been generous with her time and advice, always ready with a 
word of encouragement or a little bit of wisdom delivered with that 
look that only she could give. That woman would walk into a room very 
quietly, and no matter how loud the room was, it got quiet because she 
had that presence about her.
  She has reminded me that public service is staying true to your word 
and putting people first and that what you do here in Congress only 
matters if it improves the lives of those back home.
  Kay, I think I speak for just about everyone in this room, well, 
everybody in Texas, when I say that you cannot be replaced. Your boots 
are way too big for anybody to fill. We are all going to miss you. 
However, what you have done will echo far beyond these Halls and these 
years. Your leadership and heart have touched so many lives, and your 
legacy is one of dedication, integrity, and love for Texas and this 
great country.
  Thank you, Miss Kay, for everything, for paving the way, for showing 
us all how it is done, and for being a good friend. I know you will 
keep making a difference wherever life takes you next.


                   200 Years of the City of Dickinson

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 200 years 
of the city of Dickinson, Texas, which I am proud to represent in 
Texas' 14th Congressional District. Dickinson has a storied history, 
and I want to be the first to say: Happy bicentennial.
  The city of Dickinson is named after John Dickinson, a landowner 
whose name became synonymous with the area. What began as an 
agricultural settlement in the mid-1800s would eventually grow into a 
thriving community thanks to the arrival of the railroad and the dreams 
of those who sought to make Dickinson their home.
  From its fertile soil to the efforts of early entrepreneurs who 
formed the Dickinson Land and Improvement Association, this city has 
long been a beacon of promise on the Gulf Coast. In its early days, 
Dickinson became known for its productive farming and later as a 
destination for those seeking a peaceful, prosperous life along the 
bayous and the prairies.
  Over the years, Dickinson has grown alongside the industrial 
expansions of nearby Houston and Galveston. The city's strategic 
location along major rail lines and highways has allowed it to benefit 
from the region's booming oil and shipping, as well as industrial 
sectors. When NASA established the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 
1962, it brought a new era of opportunity and development to our 
community and to its neighbors.
  Today, Dickinson is home to over 20,000 hardworking, admirable 
citizens who exemplify the very best of southeast Texas values. This is 
a community built on grit, resilience, and a deep sense of pride.
  As your Representative, I am grateful every day to stand before you 
as the voice of the city of Dickinson in these hallowed Halls of 
Congress. It is an honor to represent a city that has made so many 
contributions to the progression of our region.
  Here is to many more years of Dickinson pride, progress, and the 
enduring southeast Texas spirit that defines us. Happy anniversary, 
Dickinson, and may your future be as bright as your storied past.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).


                          Honoring Kay Granger

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber so very much for yielding.
  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, we honor a trailblazing 
woman, Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger. Without question, history will 
record Chairwoman Granger shattered many glass ceilings during her 
service in Congress.
  She became the first Texas woman to serve in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Think about that alone, just coming out of Texas, the 
first woman, starting in 1997.
  Kay went on to serve honorably in this Chamber for 28 years. She 
became the first Republican woman to receive appointment to the 
Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations and then later became its chair. 
She rose also as a leader for her party on the committee, including as 
chairwoman of the full committee, for the first year of the 118th 
Congress.
  Kay always found a way to work together in a bipartisan fashion to 
pass our Nation's largest budget to bolster our Nation's military, 
surely for the advancement of the F-35, as well as funding in another 
agency, NASA's, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
Artemis program and other space priorities.
  She always had a vision beyond the narrow to embrace the globe.
  I have always appreciated her professionalism and her passion, which 
she kept under control, especially for her home State of Texas, and her 
candor and no-nonsense demeanor. I know that Kay will continue to speak 
for the people of Parker and Tarrant Counties and to work for their 
betterment even in retirement because that is her nature.
  I am virtually and mentally sending her a bouquet of roses as we are 
speaking tonight. I thank her for her remarkable and honorable service 
to our Nation. We wish her Godspeed on a job exceptionally well-done.
  I have heartfelt wishes that the years ahead will be ones of 
fulfillment and adventure, as well.
  Mr. Speaker, regarding a previous Special Order this evening, I ask 
unanimous consent to include in the Record The New York Times article 
about the changes in Syria written by Peter Baker and Adam Entous.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Ohio?
  There was no objection.

                [From The New York Times, Dec. 8, 2024]

 Biden Weighs Approach to Rebels in Syria Amid Secret Message Exchange

                    (By Peter Baker and Adam Entous)

       President Biden faces the challenge of deciding how to 
     engage the main armed group that toppled President Bashar al-
     Assad, even though it remains designated a terrorist 
     organization by the United States.
       For President Biden, the fall of Syria's tyrant on Sunday 
     was a moment to cheer what he called a ``fundamental act of 
     justice'' and to claim a measure of credit for his own 
     policy.
       But it also presented Mr. Biden with a fundamental 
     challenge late in his presidency: How does the United States 
     make friends with the newly emerging forces taking control in 
     Syria when it has deemed them terrorists? And should it?
       The main rebel faction that toppled President Bashar al-
     Assad is a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was once 
     an affiliate of Al Qaeda and, even though it broke with the 
     older organization years ago, remains designated a terrorist 
     group itself by the U.S. government.
       The United States has been passing messages through the 
     Turkish government in recent days to the rebel groups 
     involved in the lightning blitz that suddenly took down Mr. 
     al-Assad, mainly warning them against teaming up with 
     militants from the Islamic State. The groups responded 
     through the Turks with assurances that they had no intention 
     of allowing the Islamic State to be part of their movement, 
     according to U.S. and Turkish officials briefed on the 
     messages.

[[Page H6594]]

       But now Mr. Biden and his top advisers are debating the 
     extent to which they should engage directly with the rebel 
     groups going forward, according to the officials, who 
     described internal deliberations on the condition of 
     anonymity. U.S. intelligence analysts and administration 
     policymakers were trying to determine whether the groups had 
     substantially changed, or were prepared to change, their ways 
     to address the concerns of the United States and its allies 
     in the region about terrorist affiliations.
       In a televised statement from the White House hailing the 
     fall of the Assad family's half century of repressive rule in 
     Syria, Mr. Biden gave voice to the mix of cautious optimism 
     and wary uncertainty about the new forces taking power in 
     Syria.
       ``Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down 
     Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human 
     rights abuses,'' he said on Sunday. ``We've taken note of 
     statements by the leaders of these rebel groups in recent 
     days and they're saying the right things now. But as they 
     take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their 
     words but their actions.''
       The Islamic State, or ISIS, remains a key concern for U.S. 
     leaders. After destroying the so-called caliphate that the 
     group carved out of Syria and Iraq for itself, the United 
     States does not want to give it any opportunity to reassert 
     itself in the chaos that may follow the fall of the 
     government in Damascus.
       ``We're cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take 
     advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to 
     create a safe haven,'' Mr. Biden said. ``We will not let that 
     happen.''
       To that end, Mr. Biden authorized U.S. airstrikes on Sunday 
     against Islamic State camps and operatives inside Syria. A 
     swarm of B-52, F-15 and A-10 warplanes hit more than 75 
     targets in central Syria with about 140 munitions, according 
     to U.S. officials.
       ``There should be no doubt--we will not allow ISIS to 
     reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in 
     Syria,'' said Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the head of the U.S. 
     Central Command, which oversees operations in the region. 
     ``All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold 
     them accountable if they partner with or support ISIS in any 
     way.''
       The situation for the United States is all the more 
     complicated by its own transition in Washington. Mr. Biden 
     has just six weeks left in office before turning over the 
     White House to President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has taken 
     pride in his role in defeating the Islamic State in his first 
     term while otherwise agitating to stay uninvolved in Syria.
       In his only comments after Mr. al-Assad's fall on Sunday, 
     Mr. Trump gave little clue to his thinking about Syria's 
     future. Instead, he cast the matter entirely in terms of its 
     implications for Russia, which had propped up Mr. al-Assad 
     for nearly a decade but essentially left him to his own fate 
     in recent days while it remains tied down in Ukraine.
       ``Assad is gone,'' Mr. Trump wrote on his social media 
     site. ``He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, 
     Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in 
     protecting him any longer.''
       He added that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia should 
     now pursue peace talks over Ukraine. ``There should be an 
     immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin,'' he 
     wrote. ``Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too 
     many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn 
     into something much bigger, and far worse. I know Vladimir 
     well. This is his time to act.''
       Mr. Biden left no doubt about American satisfaction over 
     Mr. al-Assad's ouster. The Syrian president has been a 
     crushing ruler of his own people, held responsible for the 
     deaths of more than 500,000 people and the displacement of 
     millions more during a civil war he waged to hold on to 
     power. He has used chemical weapons on his own people and 
     been a source of major instability in the region. As far back 
     as 2011, President Barack Obama called on Mr. al-Assad to go 
     and later drew a ``red line'' against the use of chemical 
     weapons that he did not enforce.
       ``At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,'' Mr. Biden 
     said in his televised remarks from the Roosevelt Room. ``This 
     regime brutalized and tortured and killed literally hundreds 
     of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a 
     fundamental act of justice. It's a moment of historic 
     opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a 
     better future for their proud county. It's also a moment of 
     risk and uncertainty.''
       Indeed, as U.S. policymakers have learned through painful 
     experience in other places in the past couple of decades, 
     places like Libya, Egypt, Iraq and Afghanistan, the demise of 
     a loathsome dictator does not necessarily lead to a 
     friendlier, more democratic, more stable government in his 
     place.
       The rebel groups have united under the leadership of Hayat 
     Tahrir al-Sham. Once seen as one of the rebellion's most 
     powerful extremist factions, the group later tried to play 
     down its radical aspects and focused on building something 
     like a civilian government--albeit an authoritarian and 
     extremist one--in the patch of territory that it has 
     controlled.
       U.S. intelligence agencies and top officials in the Biden 
     administration are still in the process of evaluating the 
     group and its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who is eager 
     for legitimacy and has mounted what one senior U.S. official 
     characterized as a ``charm offensive'' aimed at allaying 
     concerns about the organization's intentions and past 
     affiliations.
       The way the official put it, ``A charm offensive might mean 
     that people are turning over a new leaf and they think 
     differently than they used to, so you should hear them out. 
     On the other hand, you should be cautious because charm 
     offensives can sometimes be misleading.''
       U.S. officials said that the Biden administration was 
     allowed to talk to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its leader even 
     though they are on the terrorist list, but that it could not 
     provide them with material support.
       While the Biden administration has so far stopped short of 
     directly talking to the group, it has been working closely 
     and directly with the U.S. military's main counterterrorism 
     partner in Syria, a Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian 
     Democratic Forces.
       According to U.S. officials, the administration encouraged 
     and provided intelligence support to the Kurds for its 
     operations to take control of Syrian territory in eastern 
     Syria, including the cities Deir al-Zour and Abu Kamal.
       The officials said the operations were meant to ensure that 
     the Islamic State could not take advantage of the situation 
     and seize the areas as Syrian government forces withdrew. 
     According to a U.S. official, the message that the United 
     States sent to the Kurds was, ``If the regime vacates 
     territory, it's going to go to somebody, so you should fill 
     the vacuum yourself rather than let ISIS fill into that 
     vacuum.''
       Mr. Biden said he was sending officials to the Middle East 
     and would personally speak with leaders from the region in 
     the coming days. He expressed commitment to helping Israel, 
     Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon as they cope with the possible 
     spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria.
       While Mr. al-Assad is reported to have now fled to Moscow, 
     where he is being given asylum, Mr. Biden said the deposed 
     Syrian leader should not be allowed impunity after years of 
     crimes. ``Assad should be held accountable,'' he said.
       In his remarks, Mr. Biden mentioned Austin Tice, the 
     American journalist who has been held in Syria for a dozen 
     years. Asked by reporters about Mr. Tice's fate after turning 
     from his microphone, Mr. Biden paused before walking out to 
     say: ``We believe he's alive. We think we can get him back.''
       After years of trying to manage foreign crises that cost 
     his party in last month's election, won by Mr. Trump, Mr. 
     Biden sought to take a share of credit for Mr. al-Assad's 
     downfall.
       He said the victory of the rebel forces over Mr. al-Assad's 
     government was made possible by the collapse of his support 
     from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, all of which the United 
     States had a hand in. He noted that U.S. military aid and 
     diplomatic support for Ukraine and Israel had bogged down 
     Russian forces in Europe, helped destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon 
     and thwarted two attacks by Iran on Israel. As a result, none 
     could help Mr. al-Assad survive.
       ``Over the last week, their support collapsed, all three of 
     them, because all three of them are far weaker today than 
     they were when I took office,'' Mr. Biden said.
       ``The upshot of this is for the first time ever, neither 
     Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this horrible 
     regime in Syria,'' he added. ``This is a direct result of the 
     blows'' inflicted by Ukraine and Israel ``with the support of 
     the United States.''
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber so much for doing this on 
Kay's behalf.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio 
for her remarks.


                    Ambassadors Preparatory Academy

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege today 
to recognize Ambassadors Preparatory Academy in Galveston, Texas, which 
I am proud to represent, for being selected as a National Blue Ribbon 
School for 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education.
  Mr. Speaker, the National Blue Ribbon School program seeks to honor 
schools from around the country that have a vision of excellence and 
hold their students and faculty to a high standard. I can't think of a 
more worthy school than Ambassadors Preparatory Academy.
  Since 2007, this school has pushed each and every student, giving 
students from low socio-economic backgrounds a chance of high-quality 
education and fostering holistic student development through the 
collective efforts of dedicated staff, dedicated parents, and dedicated 
community members.
  I believe their mission, Mr. Speaker, and their dedication to it have 
rightfully earned them this great honor. Their commitment to providing 
high-quality education through, student-centered, data-driven 
instruction in a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment builds a 
strong foundation for lifelong learning.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the superintendent, Dr. Rachelle Joseph; 
the

wonderful teachers; the educators; and the staff at Ambassadors 
Preparatory Academy, as well as the dedicated students and their 
families on this great achievement.

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to

be with our Lord on April 18 at the young, young age of 52.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  Andy was a man of many talents, pursuing careers such as underwater 
welding and transitioning to a pilot, where he was employed with the 
Garrett Flying Service for over three decades.
  His attainment of the Pilot of the Year Award from the Texas 
Agricultural Aviation Association was a small recognition for how truly 
amazing he was.
  Andy was a guiding light in his community. He dedicated himself to 
serving God through charitable work and actively participating in his 
church as a eucharistic minister and a proud member of the Knights of 
Columbus.
  Andy exemplified the values that make this country great: faith, hard 
work, and service to others. May we all follow in Andy's footsteps and 
lead with loyalty, kindness, and service.
  Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to represent Andy in Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).


                          Honoring Kay Granger

  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding, and 
I appreciate his efforts to block this time for the Texas delegation to 
honor one of our own, Kay Granger, whom we will miss going forward.
  So many of my colleagues have already touched on her biography and on 
her history as a teacher, businesswoman, mayor, Congresswoman, and, 
probably most importantly, wife and mother.
  She is someone who has served Texas so ably and well, rising up to 
chair the Appropriations Committee and to do so with grace during a 
fairly tumultuous time in our Nation's history--this is not political; 
this is about honoring Kay--because of the nature of our disagreements 
with the current administration and the current state of things.
  She managed the appropriations process and committee with grace and 
class. She has been a true joy to work with.
  I don't always race to the floor to do these. I feel like you have to 
know someone pretty well or have a certain level of understanding and 
respect, but Kay was always very gracious and kind to me as a not-
always soft-spoken member of the Conference or the delegation, as my 
friend from Texas knows. She was always one who would try to reach out 
and offer some advice, but not try to tell me what to do or say, but to 
come in and talk to me about what we need to do as Texans and how we 
can work together to do it.
  She always cared about Texas. She always cared about service, and I 
was proud to serve with her. None of us in this body agree on 
everything at any given moment, but to work with someone who had such a 
fervor for public service from, as I said, the time of being a teacher, 
mayor, Congresswoman, and rising up to run the Appropriations 
Committee.
  I will miss her. We were proud to have her in the Texas delegation as 
the chair of Appropriations, but she will be able to be back in Texas, 
which is a good thing.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words.
  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes 
remaining.


              Honoring the Life of Robert ``Bob'' Wieners

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the life of an exceptional public servant, a man who served our 
great Nation with unwavering integrity and dedication, and a friend I 
was proud to know, Chief Robert Wieners, who went home to be with the 
Lord on August 24, 2024.
  After graduating from Boston State College in 1978, Bob answered the 
call to serve our Nation in the United States Marine Corps. Over the 
course of more than 20 years, he rose through the ranks to become a 
lieutenant colonel, retiring from Active Duty on September 1, 1998.
  His time in the Marines was marked by superior leadership and 
operational excellence, a testament to the character of a man we honor 
today.
  Friendswood was truly blessed beyond measure when Bob and his bride, 
Susan, made it their home. For over two decades, Bob led our community 
as chief of police, leaving an indelible mark on Friendswood through 
his 24 years of dedicated service.
  Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of getting to know Bob over the years, 
and his tireless work to protect our community along with his deep love 
of Friendswood will never be forgotten.
  Brenda Gail and I are praying for the entire Wieners family, the 
Friendswood Police Department, and everyone who had the privilege of 
calling Bob their friend.
  Mr. Speaker, may we all strive to uphold the values he so proudly 
embodied.


             Paying Tribute to Chester A. ``Pete'' Shelton

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
pay tribute to a great American, Chester A. ``Pete'' Shelton, who was 
called home to be with the Lord on July 25, 2024.
  Pete was the kind of man who knew what it meant to serve. Following 
in his family's footsteps, he became a Beaumont firefighter right after 
high school and eventually served as the city's fire chief.
  He didn't stop there. Pete answered the call of duty by joining the 
United States Army in 1958, proudly serving his country and continuing 
in the Reserves until 1966.
  Beaumont was blessed to have Pete's dedication. He not only helped 
develop the fire chief's code of ethics but also gave over 30 years of 
service on the Port of Beaumont Board of Commissioners. His impact was 
deep, and his commitment to service was unwavering.
  Mr. Speaker, Pete Shelton's legacy of kindness, compassion, and 
selfless service will live on in the hearts of all who knew him. May we 
all strive to live by the values he so faithfully upheld.


                         Honoring Yvonne Dewey

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor a true patriot and dear friend, the incredible Yvonne Dewey. She 
was called home to be with the Lord on September 2 at age 84.
  Yvonne was the very definition of honor and loyalty. I knew her 
personally. When she moved to Lake Jackson, Texas, back in 1971, she 
didn't just plant roots. She left a legacy.
  Her impact on our community and the Republican Party is immeasurable. 
She didn't just participate. She led, serving on countless boards and 
associations, always working to better the lives of our youth.
  Mr. Speaker, when she stepped in to chair the Republican Party of 
Brazoria County for 21 years, she did a great job. I watched her up 
close and personal.
  I had the privilege of meeting Yvonne when I was just a precinct 
chair. She was someone I could look up to for wisdom and leadership. 
Over the years, we developed a lasting friendship.
  I saw firsthand her gift for leading the Republican Party and helping 
elect the kind of patriots that represent the best of Brazoria County.
  Yvonne didn't just talk the talk; she lived it. Her spirit and 
passion for conservative principles were undeniable, and her selfless 
dedication earned her the respect of so many in our community.
  This woman of service led by example, and we can all learn from her 
kindness, her dedication, and her selflessness. Her legacy will live on 
in Brazoria County, and I am honored to have served her in Congress 
and, most of all, to have called her my friend.
  Mr. Speaker, let us pray that we continue to see fearless leaders 
like Yvonne Dewey rise up for our Nation. Her love for this country and 
southeast Texas is and was unmatched.
  Brenda Gail and I extend our heartfelt thanks to her husband of 50 
years, John Dewey, who was her rock, and we know how deeply she loved 
him and the family.


                         Honoring Ray Holbrook

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible 
man and true Texas patriot, Ray Holbrook, who was called home to be 
with the Lord on May 1 of this year at the vibrant age of 97.
  Ray was a pillar of strength, integrity, and service to Galveston 
County

for many, many years. He served as the longest-standing county judge 
from 1967 to 1995, dedicating nearly three decades of his life to 
making his community a better place, and he was very successful.
  Ray wasn't just a judge. He was a man of action, Mr. Speaker. A proud 
Aggie, he is fondly remembered for his tireless work of improving 
roads, upgrading parks, and fighting to improve the lives of county 
employees by removing them from Social Security and putting them on a 
better retirement system.
  Mr. Speaker, perhaps his greatest legacy is helping create the 
Galveston County Water Authority, which has grown over time into the 
Gulf Coast Water Authority, ensuring that future generations will have 
access to the water resources they so desperately need.
  Ray's impact reaches far beyond his accomplishments in office. He was 
a beloved father and friend, a man whose deep faith and unwavering 
commitment to his neighbors left an indelible mark on all who knew him. 
His life of service, devotion to his community, and deep love for the 
Lord will continue to inspire us all.
  May God bless Ray Holbrook's family, and may his legacy of 
leadership, honor, and faith live on in Galveston County and beyond.


Celebrating Retirement of Texas State Representative Edward Lynn ``Ed'' 
                                Thompson

  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend 
and esteemed successor from the great legislative district of Texas-29 
on the occasion of his retirement as State representative.
  Since taking office in 2013, he has been a staunch defender of Texas 
constitutional rights. His leadership has been pivotal in securing 
funding for Texas roads, supporting our public schools, and fighting to 
protect our border. His unwavering commitment to our State has been 
felt across Texas.
  Ed has stood firm against Federal overreach, championed policies that 
protect the unborn, and defended our religious liberties.
  Ed's legacy of principled leadership and courage will be deeply 
missed.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I thank my 
good friend for his leadership. Southeast Texas and the great State of 
Texas are better because of him.
  Brenda Gail and I wish him and his bride, Freddie, all the best in 
his well-deserved retirement.
  May God bless him and Freddie in their retirement, and may God 
continue to bless Texas.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows the saying ``nobody messes with 
Texas.'' Well, the same could be said of Chairwoman Kay Granger. She's 
as ``Texas Tough'' as it comes, an unwavering force evident in her 
nearly three decades of faithful service to our Nation.
  As someone who has sat at the leadership table alongside her and 
worked hand-in-glove with her on the Appropriations Committee, I can 
attest that she is one of the best legislators I have ever had the 
honor and privilege of working with. Throughout her career, she has 
fiercely fought for the people of Texas' 12th district. She is the 
definition of a defense hawk--steadfast in her commitment to ensuring 
our Nation remains the number one military power in the world. And she 
is a conservative stalwart that masterfully negotiated Republican 
priorities in a gridlocked government.
  Her trailblazing career was characterized by historic firsts. She was 
the first woman mayor of Fort Worth, the first Republican woman to 
serve in Congress in the Texas delegation, the first woman to serve on 
and chair the Defense Subcommittee, and the first Republican woman to 
chair the full Appropriations Committee.
  More importantly than her impressive list of accomplishments and 
superb leadership abilities, she has been a dear friend to me, who 
showed me the ropes and whose invaluable wisdom I will dearly miss here 
in Congress. Texas was lucky. America was luckier.
  Chairwoman Granger leaves behind a towering legacy of grit and grace 
that will continue to inspire this institution for decades to come and 
it is a privilege to honor her on the House Floor.
  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman 
Weber, for putting this Special Order together. I know it is probably 
odd seeing a Democrat up here, but let it be known:
  Kay and I go way back. I've known her since the 1990's, when she made 
history as the first woman Mayor of Fort Worth, while also being a 
single mom. Even then, she had that Texas grit and determination that's 
carried her through a lifetime of breaking barriers.
  As the first woman to represent the 12th District of Texas, Kay 
showed what it means to lead with heart and conviction. She's fought 
for her community every step of the way, never backing down from a 
challenge. They say, ''Don't mess with Texas,'' but really, don't mess 
with a Texas woman on a mission. Texas--and this Congress--will miss 
her.

    JOINT EXPLANATORY MATERIAL STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY MR. ROGERS OF 
   ALABAMA, CHAIR OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES, ON HOUSE 
               AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 5009

       The following consists of the joint explanatory material to 
     accompany the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025.
       Section 5 of the Act specifies that this joint explanatory 
     statement shall have the same effect with respect to the 
     implementation of this legislation as if it were a joint 
     explanatory statement of a committee of conference.
       In this joint explanatory statement, the provisions of H.R. 
     8070, the House-passed version of the Servicemember Quality 
     of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2025, are generally referred to as ``the 
     House bill''. The provisions of S. 4638, the Senate Committee 
     on Armed Services committee-reported version of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, are generally 
     referred to as ``the Senate committee-reported bill''. The 
     provisions in the Senate floor manager's package are 
     generally referred to as ``a proposed amendment (amendment 
     number 3290) to the Senate committee-reported bill''. The 
     final form of the agreements reached during negotiations 
     between the House and the Senate are referred to as ``the 
     agreement''.
     Disclosure of earmarks and congressionally directed spending 
         items
       Although not required by the Rules of the House of 
     Representatives, the joint explanatory statement includes a 
     table that lists the congressional earmarks (as defined in 
     paragraph (e) of clause 9 of rule XXI of the House of 
     Representatives) that are contained in the bill or this joint 
     explanatory statement at the request of a Member of the House 
     of Representatives. The bill or this joint explanatory 
     statement does not contain any congressional earmarks at the 
     request of a Senator. Neither the bill nor the joint 
     explanatory statement contains any limited tax benefits or 
     limited tariff benefits as defined in paragraphs (f) or (g) 
     of clause 9 of rule XXI of the House of Representatives.
     Summary of discretionary authorizations and budget authority 
         implication
       The budget request for national defense discretionary 
     programs within the jurisdiction of the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives for 
     fiscal year 2025 was $883.7 billion. Of this amount, $849.5 
     billion was requested for Department of Defense programs, 
     $33.8 billion was requested for national security programs in 
     the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities 
     Safety Board, and $378 million for defense-related 
     activities.
       The agreement would authorize $883.7 billion in fiscal year 
     2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense 
     programs, $33.3 billion for national security programs in the 
     Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities 
     Safety Board, and $512.4 million for defense-related 
     activities.
       The two tables preceding the detailed program adjustments 
     in division D of the accompanying joint explanatory statement 
     summarize the discretionary authorizations in the agreement 
     and the equivalent budget authority levels for fiscal year 
     2025 defense programs.
     Sec. 4--Budgetary effects of this Act
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 4) that would state the budgetary effects of this Act 
     for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go 
     Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139).

       The agreement includes the Senate provision.

            DIVISION A--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATIONS

     establish

[[Page H6597]]

     a centralized security monitoring program for installations

     would also require the Secretary of the Army to provide a 
     report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and 
     the House of Representatives that outlines the plans of the 
     Secretary to implement the centralized security monitoring 
     program.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would require the Secretary of the Army to 
     provide a plan to establish centralized security monitoring 
     facilities that includes estimated costs to establish, 
     operate, and maintain these facilities. Further, it would 
     require commencement of the program not later than fiscal 
     year 2027.
     Sec. 112--Pilot program on the use of robotic targets to 
         enhance the lethality of the reserve components of the 
         Army
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 111) that would 
     direct the Secretary of the Army to carry out a pilot program 
     under which the Secretary incorporates the use of moving 
     robotic target systems into live fire training provided to 
     select infantry units of the reserve and National Guard 
     components of the Army.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision.
     Sec. 113--Plan for additional kinetic effectors for low, 
         slow, small unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system of 
         the Army
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 113) that would require the Secretary of the Army to 
     certify at least one additional interceptor and production 
     manufacturer for the U.S. Army's low, slow, small-unmanned 
     aircraft integrated defeat system.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would require the Secretary of the Army to 
     develop and implement a plan for the procurement and fielding 
     of additional kinetic effectors for low, slow, small-unmanned 
     aircraft integrated defeat system of the Army.
     Sec. 114--Report on procurement of energetic materials from 
         sources outside of the United States
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 112) that would 
     limit the Secretary of the Army from procuring certain end 
     items containing energetic materials that are in production 
     at a Federal Government-owned production facility until the 
     Secretary provides a certification to the congressional 
     defense committees.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision with an 
     amendment that would strike the funding limitation and 
     require a report on the procurement of energetic materials 
     from sources outside the United States.
       We note that the Department of the Army has been unable to 
     sustain the ammunition industrial base to any level of 
     certainty. Previous munitions budgeting variability led to 
     closures and consolidations of the ammunition industrial base 
     including the Base Realignment and Closure of prominent 
     ammunition production capabilities. Budgeting uncertainty 
     continues today. For example, the U.S. Army programmed to 
     produce 34,380 rounds of 155mm ammunition production in 2014. 
     Today, the U.S. Army is projecting a contractor and organic 
     industrial base to produce a purported 1.2 million rounds of 
     155mm ammunition by early next year. We note that 1.2 million 
     rounds is a laudable goal that greatly exceeds Army 
     acquisition objectives and is being principally developed to 
     support rearming our allies and partners.
       Additionally, we note that the U.S. Army has used the 
     Ukrainian supplemental appropriations to expand contractor 
     operations by direct investment into contractor facilities. 
     We believe that this contractor direct investment was 
     necessary because of the aforementioned budgeting variability 
     and the inability of industry to rely on any level of 
     sustained U.S. Army ammunition investment. Finally, we 
     believe that ammunition production levels may return to 
     previous de minimis level that will cause the industrial base 
     to again contract. We are disturbed that the U.S. Army is 
     unable to articulate the maximum production capacity of the 
     organic industrial base and believe that maximum organic 
     industrial base capacity should be obtained before additional 
     contractor sources are developed. We believe that the organic 
     industrial base needs to be prioritized to ensure long-term 
     capability is maintained. We support the retention of 
     ammunition organic industrial base so that when the 
     inevitable reduction of ammunition production is programmed, 
     a core organic industrial base can be retained for future 
     mobilization.

                       Subtitle C--Navy Programs

     Sec. 121--Modifications to procurement authorities for 
         certain amphibious shipbuilding programs

         degaussing systems into Arleigh Burke class destroyers
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision

     advanced degaussing system in the Arleigh Burke-class 
     destroyer from fiscal year 2025 until fiscal year 2028 in 
     order to have this design change match the beginning of the 
     next destroyer multiyear contract.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision.
       We also expect the Navy to exercise due diligence in

     require the Secretary of the Navy to designate an official 
     who is responsible for autonomous surface and underwater 
     dual-modality vehicles.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision with a technical

     fiscal year 2023.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision with an 
     amendment that would require that: (1) Eight F/A-18E/F Super 
     Hornet aircraft from the fiscal year 2023 procurement go to 
     U.S. Navy Reserve; (2) The Secretary of the Navy develop a 
     cost estimate for establishing any of the existing U.S. Navy 
     Reserve fighter squadrons tactically deployable to meet 
     geographical combatant commander operational requirements; 
     and (3) Remove the mandate for establishing a tactically 
     deployable U.S. Navy Reserve F/A-18E/F squadron until the 
     cost estimate is submitted and assessed by Congress.
     Sec. 128--Limitation on the construction of the Landing Ship 
         Medium
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 136) that would 
     prohibit the obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to 
     be appropriated by this Act for the procurement of the Medium 
     Landing Ship (LSM) until the Secretary of the Navy certifies 
     that the LSM design is not based on more than 35 percent 
     military specifications. It would also require the Secretary 
     of the Navy to submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees detailing the differences in cost and construction 
     schedules between a ship design based on military 
     specifications and a design that uses commercial standards 
     and elements.

     create no lapse in U.S. Air Force capabilities.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision.
     Sec. 145--Extension of requirements relating to C-130

     covered foreign entity.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 883) that would prohibit the Secretary of Defense from 
     operating or entering into contracts for procurement of light 
     detection and ranging technology from covered foreign 
     countries.
       The agreement includes the House provision.
     Sec. 165--Limitation on procurement of F-35 aircraft pending 
         certification on improvements and correction of 
         deficiencies
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 174) that would 
     permit the Secretary of Defense to accept delivery of only 48 
     of 58 F-35 aircraft authorized for procurement during fiscal 
     year 2025 until the Secretary submits to the congressional 
     defense committees certain corrective action plans and

     for 5 consecutive years beginning on April 1, 2025, for all 
     corrective actions and plans implemented by the Secretary.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 133) that would amend section 226 of the 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 
     (Public Law 118-31) to require more information on the plans 
     of the Department of Defense to upgrade the Joint Strike 
     Fighter (JSF) propulsion and thermal management systems.
       The agreement includes the House provision with minor 
     technical changes.
       We understand that the F-35 prime contractor has committed 
     to investing $350.0 million of its own resources to improve 
     program execution and increase efficiencies with development, 
     testing, and fielding of new hardware and software 
     capabilities. This, in part, is to address shortages that the 
     prime contractor faces within the program's enterprise. We 
     encourage other major subcontractors participating in the 
     program to also consider investing internal financial 
     resources into the program to enable more efficiencies and 
     greater productivity to accelerate the development, testing, 
     and fielding of new and more advanced capabilities that 
     are required to counter existing and future threats from 
     adversaries.

     mix of missiles, including an assessment of whether extending 
     the range or capability of existing air-to-air missiles would 
     better support combined combatant command requirements at 
     medium risk.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would add a requirement to submit an 
     unclassified report, which may include a classified annex, to 
     the congressional defense committees not later than April 1,

       We believe that wideband adaptive signal processing shows 
     promise as part of a broader suite of dynamic spectrum 
     sharing (DSS) technologies. We note that the National 
     Spectrum Strategy (NSS) Implementation Plan promotes 
     demonstration of advanced DSS technologies and techniques. We 
     also note strong congressional support for such a 
     demonstration: most recently in the House report accompanying 
     H.R. 2760 (H. Rept. 118-125) of the National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. We believe that the 
     rapid and thorough conduct of such a demonstration is 
     essential, not just to show the feasibility of 
     additional spectrum access for civilian spectrum users 
     without compromising Department of Defense and 
     intelligence community missions and capabilities, but also 
     to demonstrate the Department of Defense's good-faith and 
     collaboration with industry, academia, and other Federal 
     departments and agencies.
       We emphasize the Department of Defense memorandum titled 
     ``Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Demonstration,'' dated September 
     18, 2024, and support the rapid pace of directed activities. 
     We are aware that the conduct of DSS demonstration requires 
     sustained effort across fiscal years and Department of 
     Defense organizations. Therefore, we

[[Page H6603]]

     direct the Secretary of Defense, not later than March 1, 
     2025, to provide a briefing to the Armed Services Committees 
     of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the plan

     Resource Management Center, the Director for Developmental 
     Test, Evaluation and Assessments, and the Director, 
     Operational Test and Evaluation;
       (2) Any barriers or challenges to execution of these plans;
       (3) DIU's plans for future test and evaluation activities, 
     including any anticipated spending and staffing estimates;
       (4) DIU's planned use of digital ranges or other test 
     infrastructure for software or data systems;
       (5) Best practices for test and evaluation for commercial 
     and non-traditional technologies;
       (6) Any plans to leverage software solutions to better 
     maximize test data collection and post-test evaluation; and
       (7) Any other information the Director deems relevant.

     Secretary of Defense, Comptroller on the obligation and 
     expenditure rates for Department of Defense basic and applied 
     research.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We note that a similar reporting requirement was included 
     in the House Report 118-529. We remain concerned with the 
     Department of Defense's obligation and expenditure policies 
     for basic and applied research at academic institutions given 
     the incongruence of the academic year and the federal fiscal 
     year. The committee urges the Department to implement 
     expenditure benchmarks policies that consider delays in 
     allocations to the grantees and are more aligned with the 
     fiscal policies and calendars of academic institutions.
       Therefore, we direct the Under Secretary of Defense, 
     Comptroller, in coordination with the Comptrollers of the 
     military departments and the Under Secretary of Defense for 
     Research and Engineering to submit a report to the 
     congressional defense

[[Page H6606]]

     committees, not later than 1 year after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, on the obligation and expenditure 
     rates for Department of Defense basic and applied research 
     that is conducted at institutions of higher education for the 
     previous five fiscal years. The report shall also identify:
       (1) The month of obligations and expenditures for basic and 
     applied research conducted at institutions of higher 
     education;
       (2) Funds realigned from basic or applied research budget 
     lines due to not meeting obligations or expenditures 
     benchmarks throughout the fiscal year and made available for 
     other purposes; and
       (3) A plan to implement revised expenditure benchmarks 
     related to research grants at institutions of higher 
     education.

     contributions of the Irregular Warfare Technical Support 
     Directorate to the fulfillment of Department of Defense 
     irregular warfare activities in support of the National 
     Defense Strategy. At a minimum, the plan shall address 
     efforts to more effectively--
       (1) Address emergent requirements within the year of 
     execution;
       (2) Lessons learned from ongoing conflicts where the U.S. 
     is not a direct participant, if feasible;
       (3) Focus and prioritize resources to rapidly address 
     Department of Defense user requirements;

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision

     unlike Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts, the 
     Department is not required to track the type of business 
     performing on an OTA. We note that elsewhere in this Act we 
     are directing the Department to track awards made through 
     OTAs to provide a better understanding of the types of 
     businesses performing on OTAs.

     ``Report on the Feasibility of the Consolidation or Transfer 
     of Space Functions of the National Guard to the Space Force'' 
     did not include the 222nd Command and Control Squadron as a 
     ``covered space function.'' We direct the Secretary of the 
     Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of Space 
     Operations, the Director of the National Reconnaissance 
     Organization (NRO), the Chief of the National Guard Bureau,

     National Guard Bureau, and the Space Force; and
       (3) Establishment of a hybrid structure involving Both 
     Space Force and Air National Guard Personnel. This option

     would combine Space Force and Air National Guard personnel 
     maintain the unique strengths of both organizations.

     languages, some of which may currently have limited to no 
     capability within the Department of Defense. We note the Air 
     Force's Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) currently 
     develops working-level foreign language proficiency for 
     airmen.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of the Air Force to 
     provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than April 
     1, 2025, on critical language proficiency in the Air Force. 
     The briefing should include information on the current status 
     of LEAP, other foreign language programs offered to airmen, 
     challenges to increasing language readiness in response to 
     current and emergent needs, a description of the process for 
     coordinating with the Army as the executive agent for 
     contract linguist support, any plans to expand the reach of 
     LEAP or other foreign language programs in the future, and 
     any additional resources needed to support linguist 
     requirements.
     Military vehicle operator training program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 549I) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to establish a standardized 
     training curriculum for military vehicle operations,

     components.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We recognize that rollover incidents continue to be an 
     ongoing safety issue for the Army and the Marine Corps. We 
     also note the Marine Corps has instituted multiple lines of 
     effort to address safety mishaps and are interested in 
     hearing about how these efforts have led to changes in 
     training and protocol. Therefore, we direct the Commandant of 
     the Marine Corps and the Chief of Staff of the Army, not 
     later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
     Act, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 
     efforts to mitigate vehicle mishaps.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Department of Defense provided a directed 
     briefing on this issue in May 2022, detailing the necessity 
     for officers to speak clearly and effectively while leading 
     troops; noting the availability of medical waivers in certain 
     circumstances for physical or medical standards; providing 
     the Reading Aloud Test administered to applicants; 
     highlighting that, on average, only one prospective student 
     per year is denied admission for a speech disorder; and 
     describing the availability of speech therapy.
     Annual training on the prevention of sexual abuse for 
         students in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps

       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note the training that would be required under the House 
     provision is already required by section 2031 of title 10, 
     United States Code, as amended by section 552 of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 
     118-31).

     includes dive school.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Air Force changed the requirement for 
     combat controllers to be combat dive qualified from an 
     initial skill to an advanced skill in 2023. We direct the 
     Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing to the 
     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, not later than June 1, 2025, on the 
     advisability of restoring dive school qualification as a 
     required element of initial training for combat controllers. 
     The briefing should include information on the justification 
     for changing it to an advanced skill, which, if any, special 
     tactics operators require advanced dive school training, the 
     benefits of dive school training in executing special tactics 
     missions, and any other information the Secretary deems 
     relevant.
     Modifications to Transition Assistance Program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 561) that would 
     amend section 1142 of title 10, United States Code, to 
     authorize the Secretary concerned to waive the requirement of 
     pre-separation counseling for servicemembers. Additionally, 
     this section would permit servicemembers who reenlist to 
     receive pre-separation counseling on a space available basis.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     planning assistance and counseling section to last at least 1 
     hour.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     counseling and training, both during the Transition 
     Assistance Program and throughout their time in service.
     Transition Assistance Program: presentation in preseparation 
         counseling to promote benefits available to veterans
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 563) that would 
     amend section 1142(b) of title 10, United States Code, to 
     require veterans service organizations (VSOs) to provide 
     information to servicemembers participating in pre-separation 
     counseling under the Transition Assistance Program (TAP).
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We recognize the critical role that VSOs play in the 
     transition of servicemembers to civilian life and veteran 
     status, particularly in the preparation, presentation, and 
     adjudication of Veterans Affairs (VA) claims. We note that 
     the TAP VA benefits and services course of instruction 
     includes a VA and VSO joint presentation to separating 
     servicemembers on how VSOs can help them navigate VA and 
     state benefit programs, including filing for disability, home 
     loans, and healthcare. The presentation also incorporates a 
     practical exercise to ensure servicemembers can find their 
     local VSO representative. We encourage the Department of 
     Defense to continue to maintain strong and positive 
     relationships with VSOs to facilitate their delivery of 
     services to separating servicemembers.

     Program (TAP) for members of the Reserve Components of the 
     Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Space Force.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that TAP counseling pathways for members of the 
     Reserve Component are addressed in a provision located 
     elsewhere in this Act.

       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Employment Navigator Partnership Program

     Labor. The current model is highly effective and provides 
     optimum flexibility for program administration, participants, 
     and partners.

         members of the Armed Forces participating in the 
         Transition Assistance Program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 567) that would 
     direct the Secretary of Defense, not later than 180 days

     before separating from Active Duty.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that existing law requires the Department of 
     Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to integrate 
     electronic medical records into the same technology platform. 
     When implemented, this integration will provide seamless 
     transition from the Military Health System to the Veterans 
     Health Administration without the need for a third-party 
     platform to collect sensitive personal and medical 
     information from servicemembers.
     SkillBridge: apprenticeship programs
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 568) that would

     history of opioid use disorder for any servicemember within 
     60 days of such member's separation from military service.

     training or internships for members of the Armed Forces 
     pursuant to the SkillBridge program established under section 
     1143(e) of title 10, United States Code.

         separating from the Armed Forces with community-based 
         organizations and related entities

     amend section 570F of the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92) to authorize 
     servicemembers transitioning off of active duty to opt out of 
     having their information shared with state veterans' 
     agencies.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained an identical 
     provision (sec. 558).
       The agreement does not include either provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to brief the Committees 
     on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, not later than May 1, 2025, on the 
     feasibility and advisability of establishing a servicemember 
     opt-out option for authorizing the Department of Defense to 
     share the information of servicemembers separating from the 
     Armed Forces with state veterans' agencies.

         Program of the Department of Defense and the Solid Start 
         program of the Department of Veterans Affairs
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 569D) that would 
     amend section 1142(b) of title 10, United States Code, by 
     expanding the mental health information that must be included

     of individuals; and (6) Any relevant legislative changes that 
     are required to adjust access standards.

     available to military members and their families that adopt 
     or take guardianship of a child, including an assessment of 
     whether to expand eligibility for such assistance to include 
     those who take legal guardianship of a child, whether a flat-
     fee entitlement would be preferable to reimbursing actual 
     costs, and whether and to what extent monetary assistance 
     authorized under existing law should be increased.

     and
       (8) Recently identified trends in the use of children's 
     hospital services by pediatric TRICARE patients.
     Notices to a dependent child regarding impending loss of 
         coverage under TRICARE program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 707) that would 
     require the Department of Defense to notify a beneficiary and 
     their military sponsor within one year of their twenty-first 
     birthday about options for TRICARE coverage; and authorize 
     the spouse of a military member to complete identification 
     card renewals for such beneficiaries.

     orthopedic surgery residencies and fellowships are the 
     primary avenues for developing advanced arthroscopic skills 
     for DOD surgeons. Surgeons requiring additional advanced 
     arthroscopic skills actively participate in professional 
     medical training courses as part of their ongoing medical 
     education. As new training needs emerge, the military 
     services will assess, develop, and deliver advanced 
     orthopedic training programs.

     accompanying H.R. 2670 (H. Rept. 118-125) of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, the Secretary 
     of Defense provided a briefing, in January 2024, to the 
     Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives 
     regarding heat-related injuries to servicemembers during 
     initial entry training. In the briefing, the Secretary 
     comprehensively addressed the Department's use of ORS--noting 
     that ORS remains an important medical therapy to treat 
     medical conditions resulting in dehydration but that ORS is 
     poorly suited as a maintenance solution to correct 
     hypohydration caused by sweat losses during heat exertion. 
     Further, the Secretary noted that existing medical literature 
     does not support the use of ORS to reduce the incidence or 
     severity of heat injury--as ORS is specifically formulated to 
     replace electrolytes lost from disease processes whereas heat 
     injury is not caused by loss of electrolytes.
     Study on lifting outpatient rehabilitation therapy maximums
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 727) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on the

     maximums and examine a range of therapy services, including 
     restorative therapies, for certain members of the Armed 
     Forces.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
     Improvements to TRICARE provider directories
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 729A) that would 
     require a managed care support contractor that supports 
     TRICARE and maintains a directory of health care providers to 
     verify and update such directory not less than every 90 days; 
     and require the Director of the Defense Health Agency to 
     review these directories not less than once each year.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We understand that the new T-5 health care contracts that 
     will commence health care delivery on or about January 1, 
     2025, will impose more stringent requirements for provider 
     directories--including a requirement to refresh network 
     provider directories with any updated information at least 
     once every 24 hours.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing, 
     not later than July 1, 2025, to the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 
     the implementation of these new, more stringent contractual 
     requirements and on actions taken by the Department in 
     response to the Government Accountability Office report 
     titled ``Defense Health Care: DOD Should Improve Accuracy of

     Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
     Year 202 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a 
     briefing, not later than March 1, 2025, to the Committee on 
     Armed Services of the House of Representatives on current 
     efforts in the Department of Defense related to obesity.
     Podiatrists in the Department of Defense
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 729C) that would 
     amend section 532(b) of title 10, United States Code, by 
     inserting ``podiatry'' after ``osteopathy''; and direct the 
     Secretary of Defense to ensure that podiatrists are assigned 
     to the medical corps of each military department.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar

       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We continue to have concerns that the Department is not 
     adequately able to reach fair and reasonable pricing with 
     sole source suppliers. We recognize the Department provided 
     comprehensive findings on cost or pricing data oversight, 
     reviews, audits, and inspections conducted by the Inspector 
     General consistent with the direction from the Joint 
     Explanatory Statement for House-passed section 895 of the 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. We 
     also recognize the study provided by the Director of Defense 
     Pricing, Contracting and Acquisition Policy on the Truth in 
     Negotiations Act as part of the Defense Contract Finance 
     Study. While the findings provide important insights, we 
     believe there is room for further improvement to the 
     Department's contract negotiation practices. In particular, 
     we believe that cost or pricing data challenges associated 
     with sole source suppliers often result from inadequate data 
     rights analysis, ordering, inspection, and enforcement. 
     Moreover, barriers to competition are created by difficult to 
     navigate qualification and test procedures and government-
     unique flow-down clauses. Therefore, we direct the 
     Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to 
     provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, 
     not later than March 1, 2025, on the feasibility and 
     advisability of creating a panel composed of both government 
     officials and industry representatives that would 
     comprehensively evaluate the challenges to, and potential 
     solutions for, ensuring fair and reasonable prices are 
     received by the Department of Defense.

     Force. The briefing should include, at a minimum, a 
     discussion of how the Air Force is measuring the impacts of

     length of time to make such determination and if the 
     Department factors in a single domestic source as a 
     justification to provide a DNAD;
       (5) The process of reviewing such determinations, including 
     factors that trigger the initiation of a review, and the 
     timelines associated with each such review; and

     findings of the study.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
     Entrepreneurial Innovation Project designations
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 851) that would 
     amend chapter 303 of title 10, United States Code, to require 
     the Armed Forces to identify promising research programs of 
     the Small Business Innovation Research Program or Small 
     Business Technology Transfer Program for inclusion in the

     capacity batteries.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We remain concerned about the Department of Defense and the 
     defense industrial base's continued reliance on non-allied 
     manufacturers for their battery requirements. While there 
     have been ongoing efforts to create alternative sources, to 
     include Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment and Defense 
     Production Act of 1950 (Public Law 81-774) investments, the 
     Department has been hamstrung by bureaucratic processes and 
     inconsistent funding. The recent imposition of Chinese 
     sanctions on United States defense companies may further 
     limit access to necessary materials. We urge the Department 
     to continue to prioritize investment and standardization in 
     battery supply chains.

     risks posed by the reviewed imports.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.

     (Public Law 87-794) requires the Department of Commerce to 
     seek interagency input when conducting import reviews. We 
     note that under this process, the Department of Defense 
     should provide input on any national security concerns 
     regarding industries of importance to the Department of 
     Defense and the defense industrial base.

     Department of Defense in the previous calendar year.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We remain concerned that there is no visibility into

     the military departments, to brief the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, no later 
     than January 1, 2026, on all national security waivers 
     granted by the Department of Defense in the previous calendar 
     year. The briefing may be submitted in a classified form. We 
     expect the Under Secretary of Defense of Acquisition and 
     Sustainment to promulgate necessary guidance to the military 
     services regarding proper reporting of national security 
     waivers for the purposes of this briefing requirement.

     thereafter until September 30, 2030 to produce a report on

     Phase-out of computer and printer acquisitions involving 
         entities owned or controlled by China
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 885) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     phase-out the procurement of computers and printers that are 
     manufactured by an entity that is owned by the government of 
     the People's Republic of China or under the influence of the 
     government of the People's Republic of China.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We note that the National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Report (H. Rept. 118-301) 
     addressed the Department of Defense's risk-based approach to 
     the procurement of information technology. We are also aware 
     that the cyber threat landscape is constantly changing, with 
     new threats emerging on a regular basis. We believe that the 
     Department should account for new cyber threats in its 
     procurement of information technology and take appropriate 
     steps to ensure that it fully mitigates the cybersecurity 
     risks of acquiring computers and printers from entities owned 
     or controlled by entities in the People's Republic of China.

     determination is made that such drugs are not otherwise 
     available in satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity to 
     meet military needs, or when needed at market prices.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We remain deeply concerned regarding the supply chains for 
     pharmaceutical products that are necessary for warfighter 
     readiness. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
     Year 2023 (Public Law 117-263) included section 860 that 
     focused on determining supply chain vulnerabilities, and the 
     Department of Defense (DOD) has made improvements in 
     identification of problematic sources. We are aware that the 
     Department is limited by the data that industry provides to 
     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding sources of 
     active pharmaceutical ingredients and other data. While the 
     DOD has a vested interest in ensuring the security of their 
     supply chains, the Department of Health and Human Services 
     (HHS) is responsible for the integrity of the pharmaceutical 
     industrial base. We are aware that HHS has the authority to 
     use the Defense Production Act for investment in the domestic 
     pharmaceutical industrial base. Improving the supply chains 
     for pharmaceuticals should be a government-wide effort.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a 
     briefing, not later than May 1, 2025, to the Committees on 
     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives 
     on:
       (1) Challenges that DOD experiences working with the 
     interagency on receiving proper data on pharmaceutical supply 
     chains, to include potential solutions;
       (2) Ongoing discussions or efforts, if any, on utilizing 
     the Defense Production Act authority under DOD or HHS for 
     warfighter necessary pharmaceutical products;
       (3) The feasibility and advisability of establishing an 
     acquisition preference to encourage domestic or allied 
     sourcing of pharmaceutical products, to include what the 
     framework could look like; and
       (4) Any other relevant items that the Secretary of Defense 
     deems appropriate.
     Prohibition on procurement and commissary sales of seafood 
         originating or processed in China
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 889) that would prohibit the Secretary of Defense from 
     entering into a contract for the procurement of seafood that 
     originates or is processed in the People's Republic of China 
     for use in military dining facilities.

         Department of Defense officials seeking employment with 
         defense contractors

     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
     110-181) to increase the length of time from two to four 
     years that certain former employees must obtain a written 
     opinion on post-Government employment restrictions before 
     accepting employment with a Department of Defense contractor.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We note that the the Department of Defense Inspector 
     General has reviewed the Departments compliance with section 
     847 four times since 2010 and found that the Department's 
     processes, timeliness, and substance of opinions fully comply 
     with the requirements of this statute.
     Amendments to contracting authority for certain small 
         business concerns
       A proposed amendment (amendment number 3290) to the Senate

     that would amend the contracting authority for certain small 
     business concerns.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include Senate provision.

     committee-reported bill contained a provision (sec. 5871) 
     that would require the Inspector General of the Department of 
     Defense to provide a report assessing whether the Department 
     has policies and procedures in place to verify that the food 
     the Department procures does not include seafood originating 
     in the People's Republic of China.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We direct the Inspector General of the Department of 
     Defense, not later than 180 days after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, to submit to the congressional defense 
     committees a report assessing whether the Department has 
     policies and procedures in place to verify that the food the 
     Department procures does not include seafood originating in 
     the People's Republic of China the importation of which is 
     prohibited under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 
     (Public Law 71-361).

     amendment that would codify the position of the Performance 
     Improvement Officer to support the Secretary and Deputy 
     Secretary of Defense for management-related activities within 
     the Department of Defense, including issuing guidance 
     chartering that position and designating that position as a 
     co-chair for the Defense Business Council under section 2222 
     of title 10, United States Code.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to

     Sec. 903--Enhanced coordination on international cooperation 
         activities
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 904) that would require the Under Secretary of Defense 
     for Policy to include the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
     Defense for International and Industry Engagement in the 
     planning for, or attendance at, any meetings with foreign 
     partners or allies related to foreign military sales or 
     certain other international armament cooperation activities; 
     and require a study by a nonprofit organization on the 
     sufficiency of organization, resourcing, manning and training 
     within the Department of Defense to support increased demand 
     for security cooperation activities.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate committee-reported 
     provision with an amendment that would modify the 
     responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
     Acquisition and Sustainment in section 133b of title 10, 
     United States Code to specify the responsibilities of that 
     office for international armaments cooperation activities, as 
     well as establish not less than two cross functional teams to 
     help improve coordination across elements within the 
     Department of Defense.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to 
     the Committees on Armed Services of the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate, not later than May 15, 2025,

       We recommend that the Department of Defense use these two 
     positions to further strengthen the capabilities of the 
     office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial 
     Base Policy (ASD(IBP)). The office of the ASD(IBP) has 
     assumed increased responsibility, and the demands placed on 
     the office warrant commensurate growth in leadership 
     positions. For example, we note the interagency's 
     increased reliance on the office of the ASD(IBP) to 
     provide economic analysis and merger and acquisition 
     reviews has not been met with a comparable increase in 
     manning resources for government positions to maintain

     (sec. 924) that would limit funds authorized to be obligated 
     or expended by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of

     implemented Section 805 of the National Defense Authorization 
     Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117-81) and Section 1046

     (sec. 906) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     include guidance with respect to the size, structure, 
     posture, and other force development planning priorities 
     specific to special operations forces in the annual Defense 
     Planning Guidance issued by the Secretary.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We recognize the importance of close coordination among the 
     senior leadership of the Armed Forces. We understand that 
     many of the issues addressed by the JCS pertain to 
     significant Department of Defense equities that do not 
     involve the Coast Guard. However, on those issues with Coast 
     Guard equities, the Commandant or the Vice Commandant of the 
     Coast Guard is present and participates in those discussions 
     and decisions.

     regularly assess the state of the Department's defense 
     industrial base efforts and to help coordinate efforts to 
     address industrial base challenges.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 850).
       The agreement does not include either provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to the 
     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives a report, not later than 180 days after the 
     date of the enactment of this Act, on the feasibility and 
     advisability of establishing a Defense Industrial 
     Revitalization Board which would be responsible for ensuring 
     the defense industrial base is prepared to meet Department of 
     Defense wartime production. The purpose of this board would

     Pacific; and
       (7) Utilize existing supply chain mapping efforts to 
     identify reliance on foreign adversaries within critical 
     munitions supply chains and recommend amelioration efforts. 
     Such a board should be composed of the following, but not 
     limited to:
       (1) Relevant Department of Defense acquisition, research 
     and engineering, and comptroller personnel;
       (2) Service acquisition executives and program managers;
       (3) Defense industry representatives;
       (4) Relevant think tank experts;
       (5) Representatives from the Under Secretary of Defense for

     (sec. 914) that would amend section 2222(f) of title 10, 
     United States Code, to include the Department of Defense 
     Performance Improvement Officer as a co-chair of the Defense 
     Business Council.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.

     Feasibility study on expanding the services provided by the 
         Air Force Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 920) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     complete a study on the feasibility and advisability of 
     expanding the services of the Office of Commercial and 
     Economic Analysis (OCEA), including an estimate of the costs 
     of such expansion.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We note the cost-effective success of the OCEA office in 
     providing crucial business intelligence to various actors 
     within the U.S. Government to help inform thinking about the 
     broader economic implications of certain acquisition 
     decisions. We note that historically such decisions have 
     focused primarily on the national security impacts, but with 
     less emphasis or in-depth understanding of the larger 
     economic consequences that should inform those national 
     security decisions. We applaud the Air Force for fostering 
     the creation of a critical mass of such economic, financial 
     and industrial policy expertise to help improve decision-
     making in the Department.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense to conduct a 
     study on the feasibility of expanding the scale and type of 
     services offered by OCEA, including a cost estimate for such 
     expansion, and submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than June 1, 2025.
       We direct the Secretary to include in this report the 
     possibility of expanding OCEA to provide additional 
     commercial and economic analysis more broadly to other 
     Department of Defense (DOD) components, including trend 
     analysis. This report should also examine the feasibility of 
     OCEA servicing as a data hub for providing additional 
     business intelligence data historically purchased by 
     components of the Department from commercial sources, 
     including firmographic and ownership information of 
     commercial actors, documentation submitted by importers and 
     exporters, ownership information pertaining to intellectual 
     property rights, and information relating to mergers and 
     acquisitions.
       We also note the creation of a National Defense Economic 
     Competition Research Council elsewhere in this bill, of which 
     OCEA will be a member. The study should address OCEA's 
     ability to contribute to the research tasks identified in 
     that provision.
     Senior Integration Group for Indo-Pacific Region
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 918) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     establish a Senior Integration Group for the Indo-Pacific 
     Region.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We strongly support the Department's use of Senior 
     Integration Groups or similar cross-functional teams to 
     integrate activities below the levels of the Secretary and 
     Deputy Secretary of Defense. We encourage the Department to 
     consider establishing such a forum to address the 
     multifaceted aspects of national defense challenges in the 
     Indo-Pacific region in coordination with U.S. allies and 
     partners.
     Defense Advisory Committee on Diversity and Inclusion Renewal
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 923) that would limit the authority of the Secretary of 
     Defense to renew the Defense Advisory Committee on Diversity 
     and Inclusion until 120 days after submitting a report to the 
     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives detailing a justification for such renewal.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.

     of the Treasury for deficit reduction.
     Sec. 1005--Revision of Department of Defense financial 
         management regulation
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1002) that would 
     require the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to 
     revise the Department of Defense Financial Management 
     Regulation to ensure that the regulation is consistent and 
     clear throughout, includes updated guidance with respect to 
     legislative and regulatory requirements, and does not include 
     guidance subject to change annually in an annual 
     appropriations act.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 1002).
       The agreement includes the House provision with a technical 
     amendment.
     Sec. 1006--Establishment of cross-functional team to oversee 
         implementation of recommendations of Commission on 
         Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Reform
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1003) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to establish a cross-

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 915).
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with a

     Officer; (10) The Secretaries of the military departments; 
     (11) The comptrollers of the military departments; and (12) 
     The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
       We direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to 
     include the following elements in the reports and briefings 
     required by this provision: (1) An assessment of the status 
     of the implementation of the recommendations of the 
     Commission on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution

     differential between the current 10-month limit and the 
     new 12-month limit.
     Sec. 1024--Improving Navy assessments required prior to start 
         of construction on first ship of a shipbuilding program
       The House bill contained provisions (sec. 1014 and sec. 
     1015) that would require: (1) Congressional certification 
     prior to the start of construction on the first ship of a 
     shipbuilding program; and (2) The Navy to improve analysis 
     and assessment of decisions made prior to the start of 
     construction on first ships of a Navy shipbuilding program.

     Sec. 1026--Exception to prohibition of overhaul, repair, or 
         maintenance of certain vessels in shipyards outside the

       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1016) that would 
     amend section Section 8680 of title 10, United States Code, 
     to allow the Navy to perform preventative maintenance that is 
     required while a ship is on deployment and is limited to 21 
     days or less to conduct that maintenance in a shipyard 
     outside the United States.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 323) that would require the Secretary of the 
     Navy to conduct a pilot program, not later than 180 days 
     after the date of the enactment of this Act, to perform 
     maintenance and repair on forward-deployed naval force ships 
     in foreign shipyards during scheduled maintenance and repair 
     periods. The provision would: (1) Terminate the pilot program 
     after 3 years; (2) Require the Secretary of the Navy to 
     produce an annual report during the pilot program; and (3) 
     Require the Secretary to provide that report to the 
     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives.
       The agreement includes the House provision with an 
     amendment that would allow the Navy to perform corrective and 
     preventative maintenance maintenance on a Navy ship overseas 
     for a period of up to 21 days, provided that the cumulative 
     maintenance performed on ships from a particular homeport 
     does not exceed 2% of the average workload over the previous 
     three years for the same homeport.
       We recommend that the Navy use any such short maintenance 
     periods, as the situation allows, to conduct necessary ship-
     checks to support post-deployment, U.S.- based maintenance 
     availabilities. Proper use of these windows in foreign 
     shipyards should allow the Navy to complete all necessary 
     maintenance planning 360 -days prior to a U.S.-based 
     maintenance availability.
     Sec. 1027--Strategy on development of naval rearm at sea 
         capability
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1017) that would 
     require the Secretary of the Navy to submit to the 
     congressional defense committees a strategy for delivering a 
     particular rearm at sea capability to the surface fleet of 
     the United States Navy.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision, modified to 
     focus on the capability to rearm at sea, rather than a 
     particular solution to achieve that capability.
     Sec. 1028--Authority to use incremental funding to enter into 
         a contract for the construction of a Virginia-class 
         submarine program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1018) that would 
     provide incremental funding authority for an additional 
     Virginia-class submarine in fiscal year 2025.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 129) that would also increase funding for the 
     Virginia-class submarine program with offsets from elsewhere 
     in the Navy budget. The agreement includes the House 
     provision with various technical amendments and an amendment 
     to stipulate that funds available from a change to the 
     contracting approach may only be used to provide for an 
     increase in wages for the shipbuilder workforce or an 
     increase in non-executive level salaries.
       We are concerned with the lack of transparency that has 
     occurred between the Navy and Congress over the last 18 
     months. The Navy negotiated a funding strategy with industry 
     that would have addressed cost growth, future cost to 
     complete, workforce wage increases and infrastructure 
     investments at both shipyards. The Navy did this in isolation 
     and failed to not only inform Congress but also the Office of 
     Management and Budget.
       As a result of the lack of communication, the Office of 
     Management and Budget has not moved the strategy forward and 
     Congress has been denied the opportunity to review the 
     strategy's documentation and details. To remedy the 
     deficiencies, the Office of Management and Budget asked 
     Congress for significant emergency appropriations in fiscal 
     year 2025 to support a plan that will require an undisclosed 
     amount of additional appropriations above the future years' 
     estimates in the President's Budget for fiscal year 2025. At 
     no point during the normal budgeting and legislative process 
     did the Navy inform Congress that there was large cost growth 
     on the fiscal year 2024 submarines and the one fiscal year 
     2025 submarine being requested. Unfortunately, the

[[Page H6650]]

     lack of communication regarding program challenges and 
     potential solutions has left Congress with few options to 
     address this situation and likely none that will rectify it 
     going forward.
       We recognize that Congress has responsibility for oversight 
     of the executive branch including access to information on 
     how final decisions were reached, particularly for decisions 
     of strategic importance where the dollar value of such a 
     decision far surpasses the major defense acquisition program 
     threshold. Denial of requests for information and veiled 
     threats of reprisals against briefers to Congress who may 
     provide requested information creates a dangerous precedent 
     that is out of line the checks and balances inherent to the 
     branches of government of the United States.
     Sec. 1029--Authority to use incremental funding to enter into 
         a contract for the construction of an Arleigh Burke-class 
         destroyer
       We recommend a provision that would authorize the Secretary 
     of the Navy to enter into an incrementally funded contract 
     for the construction of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.
     Sec. 1030--Pilot program on use of automated inspection 
         technologies at shipyards
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1019) that would 
     authorize a pilot program to procure automated inspection 
     technologies for maintenance inspections of naval vessels and 
     upgrade information technology infrastructure to support 
     integrating these technologies.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision.
     Sec. 1031--Requirements for the unmanned maritime autonomy 
         architecture
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1022) that would require the Secretary of the Navy to 
     provide a forum on unmanned maritime autonomy architecture to 
     facilitate industry participation in the creation and 
     management of modular open systems architecture and 
     associated standards for maritime unmanned systems.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision.
     Sec. 1032--Competitive demonstration of large and extra large 
         unmanned underwater vehicles
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1023) that would require the Secretary of the Navy to 
     conduct a competitive demonstration of extra large unmanned 
     underwater vehicles--including non-developmental items from 
     commercial or foreign partner sources.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would include in the demonstration large 
     unmanned underwater vehicles in addition to extra large 
     unmanned underwater vehicles.
     Sec. 1033--Requirement for mature ship design
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1026) that would:

     require senior technical authority determination of 
     commercial or nongovernmental standard approval, or contract 
     solicitation allowance, prior to incorporation of such 
     assumptions into shipbuilding cost estimates;
       (2) Require the Secretary of the Navy to adopt certain 
     recommendations of the Government Accountability Office;
       (3) Amend section 8669a of title 10, United States Code, to

       (4) Amend section 8669b of title 10, United States Code, to 
     require collaboration between the Naval Systems Engineering 
     and Logistics Directorates of Naval Sea Systems Command and 
     the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfare Systems with 
     respect to use of funds from the start of the requirements 
     process; and
       (5) Amend section 231(b) of title 10, United States Code, 
     to require an explanation of reductions to the procurement of 
     a class of vessels in the future years defense program from 
     year-to-year.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would require the Secretary of the Navy to 
     implement recommendations 1, 3, 4, and 6 in the report of the 
     Government Accountability Office titled, ``Navy Shipbuilding: 
     Increased Use of Leading Design Practices Could Improve 
     Timeliness of Deliveries'', and dated May 2, 2024 (GAO-24-
     105503).
       In addition, we direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
     for Research, Development, and Acquisition, in coordination 
     with the Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), to 
     provide a report, not later than one year after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, to the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives that 
     details the following:

       (2) Which specifications in paragraph (1) allowed for 
     alternative specifications--including alternative 
     specifications conditional on NAVSEA approval;
       (3) How many alternative specifications allowed in 
     paragraph (2) were recommended by the awarded contractor in

     our naval fleet remains operational and capable of meeting 
     evolving threats, thereby sustaining the Navy's readiness and 
     strategic capabilities. By employing skilled workers and 
     advanced technologies, the shipyards facilitate necessary 
     overhauls and upgrades, which are vital for maintaining the 
     effectiveness of both surface ships and submarines. The

     the lives of CG-67 and CG-70.

     Prohibition on operation of connected vehicles designed, 
         developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, 
         controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of a 
         foreign entity of concern on Department of Defense 
         property
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1048) that would 
     ban connected vehicles that are designed, developed, 
     manufactured, or supplied by foreign entities of concern that 
     pose an undue or unacceptable risk to national security from 
     entering U.S. military bases and Department of Defense 
     installations.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Department of Commerce has recently 
     announced a proposed rule that would prohibit the import and 
     sale in the United States of connected vehicles, or component 
     parts, with sufficient nexus to foreign entities of concern. 
     We further note, that malicious access to these vehicles and 
     systems presents a particular risk to Department of Defense 
     installation security. Acknowledging the on-going rulemaking, 
     we note that should these systems enter the United States 
     market via vehicles not manufactured by foreign entities of 
     concern, there may be practical challenges related to 
     identification of these vehicles at entry control points, 
     which the Department will have to manage. Accordingly, we 
     direct the Secretary of Defense, not later than 180 days 
     after the date of the enactment of this Act, to provide a 
     briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate 
     and the House of Representatives on both the Department's

     mitigate risk should these systems be allowed into the United 
     States' automobile market.

     any individual from the West Bank or Gaza who is not a 
     United States citizen, the immediate family member of a

     Year 2025 and encourage the Department of the Air Force to 
     keep the congressional defense committees apprised of any 
     potential changes to the scope or mission of the CRTCs.

     initiating a background investigation already include 
     questions on support for terrorist organizations. We urge the 
     Department to continue to place focus on these questions 
     during the adjudication process, which provides the proper 
     forum for making decisions regarding such background 
     investigation concerns.

     maintaining oversight of facility utilization is critical to 
     optimizing space allocation and reducing unnecessary 
     expenditures, allowing more resources to be allocated to 
     mission-essential activities. Additionally, we note that this 
     agreement includes a provision from the House bill (sec. 
     2838) that would require the Department of Defense to

     Department of Defense published its Biodefense Posture Review 
     in August of 2023. We believe that the administration and the 
     Department of Defense should routinely update the National

     threats and capabilities change to ensure that U.S. 
     capabilities keep pace with the threat environment as

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We agree that the Chief of Naval Operations, in 
     consultation with JIATF-South, should develop recommended

     dogs by China.
       The Senate bill contained a similar provision (sec. 1262) 
     that would require the Secretary of Defense to provide the 
     congressional defense committees with a report on corruption 
     in the People's Liberation Army.

       We believe future iterations of the Department of Defense's 
     annual report on Military and Security Developments Involving 
     the People's Republic of China required by section 1202 of 
     Public Law 106-65 should include, to the extent feasible, an

     relationship between the People's Republic of China and the 
     Islamic Republic of Iran, developments concerning the Tibetan

       (1) An analysis of unmanned ground and air systems and a 
     comparison of the capability, capacity, and operating cost 
     tradeoffs associated with each such system and those 
     associated with similar manned technologies or systems;
       (2) Recommendations regarding new areas in which unmanned 
     technology could supplant or complement manned systems in 
     order to reduce overall force operating costs; and
       (3) Such other matters as the Comptroller General

     Russia, the managers believe this study would be better 
     conducted by the Department of Commerce rather than the 
     Department of Defense.

     Department of Defense to complete harbor and channel dredging 
     at seaports that require such dredging.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We agree with the concerns expressed in the Senate report 
     accompanying S. 4638 (S. Rept. 118-188) of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 recognizing 
     that strategic seaports designated under the Strategic 
     Seaport Program are critical transportation nodes necessary 
     to support U.S. military rapid deployment requirements. We 
     understand that there may be insufficient U.S. dredging 
     capacity that has created a backlog in federal navigation 
     maintenance work limiting the readiness of some seaports. We 
     agree that the Commander, U.S. Transportation Command should 
     provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 
     1, 2025, on impacts that reduced dredging capacity may have 
     had on designated strategic seaports. The briefing should 
     identify any operational impacts of reduced dredging of 
     designed strategic seaports, and if applicable, provide 
     recommendations on the prioritization of available dredging 
     capacity.
     Report on red flags missed in Janet Yamanaka Mello fraud

     on the Navy's use of immersive learning capabilities.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Senate Report accompanying this Act 
     directed the Secretary of the Navy to deliver a briefing not 
     later than January 1, 2025 on extended reality training. We 
     further direct this briefing to be delivered to the Armed 
     Services Committee of the Senate and House of 
     Representatives. Additionally, we direct the Secretary of the 
     Navy to submit a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services 
     of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later 
     than March 1, 2025, on how extended reality (XR) training 
     capabilities have been, or potentially could be, integrated 
     into training across the U.S. Navy. The briefing shall 
     include any efforts of the U.S. Navy to coordinate with the 
     U.S. Air Force on lessons learned related to XR training, an

       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1069P) that 
     would require the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) to 
     provide a report on the potential cost-savings of 
     incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-domain, 
     attributable autonomous, semi-autonomous, unmanned systems, 
     capabilities and processes into the military department and 
     the civilian workforce of the Department of Defense.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that there are clear indications that the use of AI 
     systems will contribute to mission effectiveness, as well as 
     cost effectiveness, of military operations. Because of the 
     pervasive application of AI across the defense enterprise, we 
     further note the difficultly in obtaining high fidelity 
     information on the broad cost-savings that might accrue. We 
     believe that the Department should focus on specific use 
     cases to estimate cost savings and that such anecdotal 
     information should inform broader extrapolation for decision-
     makers.

     Forces and the military and naval forces of allies and 
     partners of the United States to confront aggressive 
     adversarial threats in the Indo-Pacific region while 
     simultaneously addressing the effects of extreme weather. At 
     a minimum, any such exercise should examine:
       (1) The resilience of U.S. weapons, systems, force posture, 
     and command and control to withstand extreme weather events 
     during a contingency in the Indo-Pacific region;
       (2) The ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to conduct 
     logistics during an extreme weather event, including the 
     ability to resupply U.S. forces, allied and partnered forces, 
     and affected civilian populations;
       (3) The resiliency of USINDOPACOM to withstand extreme 
     weather events;
       (4) The ability of USINDOPACOM to continue operations with 
     a partial or complete loss of overseas critical 
     infrastructure due to extreme weather;
       (5) The ability of the U.S. Armed Forces, in coordination 
     with allies and partners, to resist force or other coercion 
     by an aggressor during extreme weather, including potential 
     scenarios involving command and control that is affected or 
     impaired by extreme weather conditions;
       (6) The effectiveness of air defense capabilities to deter 
     missile threats from the People's Republic of China or the 
     Democratic People's Republic of Korea during extreme weather;
       (7) The ability of military and naval forces to operate in 
     every domain during extreme weather; and
       (8) The extent to which ground-based targeting and firing 
     would be affected by extreme weather in in the Indo-Pacific 
     region.
       Furthermore, in conducting any such tabletop exercise, we 
     suggest that the Commander, USINDOPACOM, consider utilizing, 
     as appropriate, the expertise and facilities of a 
     postsecondary education institution of the Department of 
     Defense. We also urge the Commander, USINDOPACOM, to consider 
     the participation of other appropriate departments and 
     agencies of the Federal Government, state and local 
     governments, and outside experts, as appropriate, in the 
     conduct of such tabletop exercises.
       Lastly, we direct the Commander, USINDOPACOM to provide a 
     briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the congressional 
     defense committees on all tabletop or other exercises 
     conducted by

     corrosion, and degradation of vessel surfaces, environmental 
     damage caused by shedding and leaching of the coating, and 
     the effect of the coating on fuel efficiency and vessel 
     speed; and
       (3) An evaluation of whether a new antifouling coating 
     standard could reduce time and costs associated with 
     maintenance, while also being environmentally sound.
       Prior to the briefing, the Secretary should evaluate 
     commercially available products, technologies, applications, 
     and services that could be used to improve combat readiness

     (Public Law 115-91) to extend a briefing requirement on the 
     use of the direct hire authority through the end of fiscal

                   Legislative Provisions Not Adopted

     Waiver of limitation on appointment of recently retired 
         members of armed forces to DOD competitive service 
         positions
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1106) that would 
     waive the 180-day limitation on appointment of recently 
     retired members of the Armed Forces to the Department of 
     Defense competitive service positions.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Department of Defense and the military 
     departments may hire recently retired military personnel 
     within the described 180-day window providing hiring managers 
     comply with competitive processes established by the Office 
     of Personnel Management.
     Mandatory public disclosures by newly nominated civilians for 
         senior positions in the Department of Defense
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1108) that would 
     require newly nominated civilians for senior positions in the 
     Department of Defense (DOD) to make certain mandatory 
     financial disclosures available on a publicly accessible 
     website.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that as part of the Senate Armed Services 
     Committee's process for considering civilian nominations to 
     senior positions within DOD requiring Senate confirmation, 
     information of the type described in the House provision is 
     provided to the Committee for its and the Senate's use in the 
     course of the Senate discharging its obligation to provide 
     advice and consent on these nominations.
     Supplemental guidance for MCO competitive service positions
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1110) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
     Director, Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the 
     Secretaries of the military departments, to establish 
     supplemental guidance for qualification standards for mission 
     critical competitive service positions.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the Department of Defense is struggling to 
     recruit and retain civilians in mission critical occupations. 
     This shortage can result in harmful impacts to our national 
     security, and negatively impact morale, training, and 
     readiness. Despite numerous efforts to alleviate these 
     issues, including providing direct hire authority and pay and 
     compensation incentives, civilian shortages in mission 
     critical occupations persist. We note that shortages are 
     further exacerbated by recruiting and retention protocols 
     across the government, including long timelines for the OPM 
     to approve or disapprove proposed incentives.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense, in 
     coordination with the Secretaries of the military departments 
     and the Director, OPM, to provide a report to the Committees 
     on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, no later than 120 days after enactment of 
     this Act, on alleviating civilian shortages for mission 
     critical occupations across the Department. The report should 
     include the following: (1) An established list of mission 
     critical occupations across the services in which a civilian 
     shortage has negatively impacted readiness across the last 3 
     years, and positions that are projected to persist or develop 
     in the next 3 years, including information on the number of 
     personnel shortages and efforts to recruit and retain these 
     occupations; and (2) An assessment of the feasibility and 
     advisability of OPM delegating the authority to service 
     secretaries to establish supplements to General Schedule 
     Classification and Qualification Standards and waive or adopt 
     occupational requirements under such mission critical 
     occupations, in order to expedite and streamline the 
     process to provide incentives to mission critical 
     occupations across the Department.
     Flexibilities for Federal employees who are armed forces 
         spouses
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1113) that would 
     provide additional flexibilities for Federal employees who 
     are also spouses of members of the Armed Forces.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We understand that military spouses face significant 
     challenges finding employment. We direct the Secretary of 
     Defense, consistent with ongoing actions directed by 
     Executive Order 14100, Advancing Economic Security for 
     Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and 
     Survivors, to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives, no later than April 
     1, 2025, on: (1) Ongoing efforts to eliminate barriers to 
     flexible work options for military spouses, to include 
     telework; (2) Options to adjust Department of Defense 
     policies to retain military spouses in existing positions in 
     a telework capability; (3) Data regarding existing military 
     spouse employment with the Department of Defense and military 
     services; (4) Ongoing challenges with utilizing military 
     spouse preferences to include the overseas direct hire 
     authority; and (5) Any other matters the Secretary determines 
     relevant.
     GAO report on home-based businesses at remote military 
         installations
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1114) that would 
     require the Comptroller General of the United States to 
     assess and submit a report to the Secretary of Defense on 
     home-based businesses operating at remote and isolated 
     installations.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.

     direct the Secretary of Defense to ensure that, to the extent 
     practicable, each commercial position in the Department of 
     Defense, or an element of the Department, is filled by a 
     civilian employee of the Department or performed by a 
     contractor of the Department, within 5 years of the enactment 
     of this section.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
     OMB employment form requirement for DOD contractors
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1117) that would 
     require all individuals hired by Department of Defense 
     contractors under Department contracts to use the Declaration 
     for Federal Employment Form OMB No. 3206-0812, typically used 
     by Federal civilian employees.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to 
     the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House 
     of Representatives by no later than April 1, 2025, on the 
     number of instances over the past 10 years of Federal 
     civilian employees whose Federal employment was terminated by 
     reason of serious misconduct and then were rehired by a 
     defense contractor for placement within the same office.
     Report on reducing misconceptions about mental health and 
         security clearance eligibility
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1853) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense, not later than 180 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to the 
     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives a report on

[[Page H6663]]

     the Department's activities to inform members of the Armed 
     Forces about how mental health affects security clearance 
     eligibility.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We remain concerned about how misperceptions regarding the 
     impact of mental health issues on security clearance 
     eligibility might influence the willingness of military 
     service members to seek necessary mental health treatment. We 
     believe better communication on how such information is used 
     in the process, including guardrails and clear guidance to 
     the workforce, is important to destigmatize mental health 
     care for those military service members who might benefit 
     from such care, but also recognize the importance of 
     maintaining their clearance for the duration of their career.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a 
     briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate 
     and the House of Representatives, by June 1, 2025, on the 
     Department's activities to inform members of the Armed Forces 
     about how mental health information is used in the security 
     clearance eligibility process. Such briefing shall include:
       (1) The Department's outreach and education activities to 
     inform members of the Armed Forces about how questions 
     regarding mental health care are used in the security 
     clearance and adjudication process and the guidelines used to 
     differentiate routine care from possible disqualifying 
     events;
       (2) The Department's outreach and education activities to 
     ensure that health care providers in the military health 
     system, non-medical counselors, TRICARE providers, and other 
     relevant personnel convey accurate information to members of 
     the Armed Forces regarding mental health and security 
     clearance eligibility;
       (3) The guardrails on the use of such information 
     incorporated into guidance to the workforce for security 
     clearance review and adjudication activities, and how 
     questions or information regarding mental health care are 
     used in continuous vetting processes; and
       (4) Description of appeals processes available to military 
     service members to dispute any decisions made related to 
     mental health care events and how such information may have 
     been used in the security clearance and adjudication process.

         limitation on the Office of the Secretary of Defense
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1105) that would amend section 143(b) of title 10, 
     United States Code, to modify the definition of personnel 
     within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) contained 
     in that subsection, and to which the personnel limitation 
     contained in section 143 applies, to no longer include 
     military and civilian personnel assigned to, or employed by, 
     direct support activities of the OSD or the Washington 
     Headquarters Services.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
     Authority to provide increased voluntary separation incentive 
         pay for civilian employees of the Department of Defense
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1106) that would amend section 9902 of title 5, United 
     States Code, to increase the maximum amount of voluntary 
     separation incentive pay for Department of Defense civilian 
     employees from $25,000 to $40,000.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
     Modification of direct hire authority for domestic defense 
         industrial base facilities
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1112) that would amend section 1125 of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 
     114-328) to include positions within the Navy Supervisor of 
     Shipbuilding, Conversion, and Repair under the direct hire 
     authority for the domestic defense industrial base authorized 
     by that section.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We encourage the Department of the Navy to work with the 
     Office of Personnel Management to acquire the desired 
     authority through existing regulatory means.

         diversity, equity, or inclusion in hiring process for 
         certain positions at Department of Defense educational 
         institutions
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1114) that would prohibit the Department of Defense 
     (DOD) from requiring or considering a diversity statement 
     from an applicant for employment at a DOD educational 
     institution.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.

         transnational maritime activity in Africa
       The House bill contained provisions (sec. 1237 and sec. 
     1601) that would amend subsection 333(a) of title 10, United 
     States Code, authority to build capacity of foreign security

     provision (sec. 1202).
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an

     programs across fiscal years, and modify section 1808 of the 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024

         Instruction and Technical Training School

     States Code, to authorize payment of fixed costs associated 
     with the Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training 
     School from amounts made available for operation and 
     maintenance, procurement, and military construction, among 
     other modifications.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
     technical amendment.
     Sec. 1203--Assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of programs 
         and activities
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1202) that would 
     modify a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to provide 
     reports on assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of security 
     cooperation programs and other related activities of the 
     Department of Defense.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar

     limitation on the aggregate value of all logistic support, 
     supplies, and services provided to friendly foreign countries 
     for the conduct of operations under section 331 of title 10, 
     United States Code, through fiscal year 2026.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with various 
     technical and clarifying amendments extending and modifying 
     an increase in the limitation on the aggregate value of all

     331 of title 10, United States Code, through fiscal year 
     2026, and requiring an annual report under section 386 of 
     title 10, United States Code.
       We understand that the United States Government and members 
     of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission in Haiti 
     have publicly expressed a desire to transition the MSS 
     mission to the United Nations or a similar multinational 
     structure. We direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a 
     report to the congressional defense committees, the Committee 
     on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on 
     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, not later 
     than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, on

     United States Code, for the MSS Mission in Haiti. Such report 
     shall, at a minimum, include the following:

     interests supported by such mission;
       (4) A description of known contributions to such mission by 
     the international community; and
       (5) With respect to such mission, a plan for the transition 
     from support provided by the Department of Defense to support 
     provided by other elements of the United States Government 
     and international partners.
       We also direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a report 
     to the congressional defense committees, the Committee on 
     Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign 
     Affairs of the House of Representatives, not later than 90 
     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, that 
     includes a summary of support provided under section 331 of 
     title 10, United States Code, during fiscal years 2023 and

[[Page H6664]]

     description of the type and associated cost of such support.
     Sec. 1206--Extension of authorities
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained provisions 
     (sec. 1208 and sec. 1215) that would extend section 1208 of 
     the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117-263) and section 1210 (E) of 
     the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) 
     through 2027.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provisions with technical 
     amendments.
     Sec. 1207--Extension and modification of defense operational 
         resilience international cooperation pilot program
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1204) that would 
     extend the Defense Operational Resilience International 
     Cooperation (DORIC) pilot program through 2027.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 1209) that would extend the DORIC pilot 
     program through 2030 and increase the annual cap on 
     expenditures under the authority to $15.0 million per year.
       The agreement includes the House provision with an 
     amendment that would extend the DORIC pilot program through 
     2027 and increase the annual cap on expenditures under the 
     authority to $15.0 million per year.
        The DORIC pilot program authorizes engagement with 
     military forces of partner countries on defense-related 
     environmental and operational energy issues in support of the 
     theater campaign plans of the geographic combatant commands. 
     We note that the National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118-31) clarified that DORIC can 
     be used for the provision of sustainment and non-lethal 
     assistance, including training, defense services, and 
     supplies (including consumables). We encourage the Department 
     of Defense to focus the use of the DORIC authority on high-
     payoff projects with foreign partners that have clearly 
     defined operational relevance and a need for such assistance, 
     even if such an approach results in the Department funding 
     fewer projects on an annual basis. We understand these high-
     payoff projects may be more expensive on a per-project basis 
     and note the agreement would increase the overall cap on the 
     authority to $15.0 million per year in anticipation of these 
     requirements. Given the limited nature of this authority, 
     funds executed under this authority must be strictly 
     prioritized to achieve the greatest benefit for the 
     geographic combatant command and partner.
     Sec. 1208--Acceptance and expenditure of contributions for 
         multilateral security cooperation programs and activities
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1201) that would amend subchapter I of chapter 16 of 
     title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of 
     Defense to accept, retain, and expend contributions, 
     including money, personal property, and services, from one or 
     more foreign governments, to carry out security cooperation 
     activities in which the foreign partner, or partners, share a 
     national security interest with the United States.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar

       (1) A description of the training of Ukrainian Armed Forces

     Sense of Congress on defense by NATO member states
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1239) that would 
     express the sense of Congress regarding the North Atlantic 
     Treaty Organization (NATO).
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 1237).
       The agreement does not include the House or Senate 
     provisions.
       We celebrate that in April 2024, the NATO alliance marked 
     75 years since its foundation. In those 75 years, NATO has 
     remained the strongest and most successful military alliance 
     in the world, founded on a commitment by its members to 
     uphold the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and 
     the rule of law. The success of NATO is critical to advancing 
     United States national security objectives in Europe, the 
     Indo-Pacific

[[Page H6668]]

     region, and around the world. The United States remains 
     steadfast in its ironclad commitment to NATO as the 
     foundation of transatlantic security and to upholding its 
     obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, including its 
     commitment to collective defense under Article 5 of the 
     Treaty.
       We welcome the addition of Finland and Sweden as the 31st 
     and 32nd members of the alliance, respectively. Both 
     countries are security providers, and their inclusion has 
     made the alliance stronger and enhanced collective security 
     by increasing alliance capabilities, particularly in the 
     Baltic Sea region and Northern Europe.
       We urge NATO member countries that have not yet met the 2 
     percent defense spending pledge, as agreed to at the 2014 
     Wales Summit, to meet the spending target as expeditiously as 
     possible and stress the importance of the affirmation at the 
     2023 Vilnius Summit that defense spending of at least 2 
     percent of gross domestic product (GDP) be seen as a minimum 
     investment. We also urge allies to continue to allocate at 
     least 20 percent of their defense budgets on major equipment, 
     including research and development.
       We note that the regional plans, agreed to by all NATO 
     member countries at the Vilnius Summit in 2023, provide 
     important clarity on the forces, capabilities, and readiness 
     levels needed to defend NATO. We also note that to implement 
     these plans and meet allied capability targets, NATO members 
     will need to spend more than 2 percent of GDP on their 
     defense.
       We urge allies to continue making efforts to address the 
     challenges posed by the coercive policies of the People's 
     Republic of China that undermine the interests, security, and 
     shared values of the alliance.
       We encourage the United States and fellow NATO allies to 
     continue to expand cooperation efforts on cybersecurity 
     issues to prevent adversaries and criminals from compromising 
     critical systems and infrastructure.
       We note that the unprovoked and illegal full-scale invasion 
     of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has fundamentally 
     altered the transatlantic security landscape and necessitates 
     the full attention of the transatlantic alliance to ensure 
     United States and allied interests and to enable Ukraine's 
     self-defense.
       We further affirm that the United States and fellow NATO 
     allies and partners should continue efforts to deliver needed 
     assistance to Ukraine as Ukraine fights against the illegal 
     and unjust war of the Russian Federation and note that United 
     States investments under the European Deterrence Initiative 
     remain critically important to deter the Russian Federation 
     from expanding its war of aggression beyond Ukraine.
       We recognize that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania continue 
     to serve as model allies, including through their defense 
     investments, modernization of key capabilities, and their 
     steadfast assistance to Ukraine, among myriad other examples. 
     We encourage the Defense Department to continue robust 
     support for efforts to advance Baltic stability and security.
       We remain concerned about the dynamic security situation in 
     the Western Balkans and believe that military-to-military 
     cooperation among the United States, the European Union, and 
     fellow NATO allies to maintain peace and security in the 
     Western Balkans is critically important.
       We condemn the efforts of the Russian Federation to assert 
     military, political, and economic dominance in the Black Sea. 
     Such actions threaten the peace and stability of the littoral 
     countries of the Black Sea, including NATO allies Bulgaria, 
     Romania, and Turkiye, and should remain a focus area for the 
     NATO alliance.
     Report on allied contributions to the common defense
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1242) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to provide a report on

     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that elements of this provision related to the 
     military capabilities of allies and partners in the Indo-
     Pacific and their contributions to mutual security objectives 
     are addressed elsewhere in the report accompanying this Act. 
     We also note that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
     (NATO) collects defense expenditure data from allies and 
     publishes it on a regular basis. We further note that NATO 
     also publishes information on NATO operations and missions in 
     which the Armed Forces of the United States and NATO allies 
     participate.
     Sense of Congress on international defense exhibitions
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1244) that would

     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     companies for their participation in the Eurosatory 
     Exhibition were illegal. Unfortunately, the Court acted too 
     late for Israeli companies to participate.

     Assistance Act of 1961, and a plan for using any remaining

       (2) The total amount of obligated, committed, and remaining

     cooperation with Morocco through the African Lion exercise to 
     continue to address the growing threats in Africa.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We recognize the twentieth anniversary of the African Lion 
     exercise hosted by Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, and Ghana. 
     African Lion is U.S. Africa Command's largest joint, all-
     domain, multi-component, multinational exercise. African Lion 
     builds and maintains interoperability with African and North 
     Atlantic Treaty Organization partners and improves 
     international efforts to meet security challenges together.
       We note the importance of the continuation of the African 
     Lion exercise in future years, including efforts to build 
     readiness to respond to crises and contingencies in Africa 
     and address security challenges around the world. We also 
     note the importance of the United States-Morocco security 
     relationship and believe that close cooperation between the 
     United States and Morocco is critical to regional security.

       We note that issues pertaining to the military activities 
     in the Arctic region of the Russian Federation and the 
     People's Republic of China are covered in annual Military 
     Power Reports. We also note that the United States' response 
     to these activities is outlined in the 2022 National Strategy 
     for the Arctic Region and the 2024 Department of Defense 
     Arctic strategy. We expect the Secretary of Defense to 
     continue to cover such issues in future Military Power 
     Reports, including any efforts by the Russian Federation and 
     People's Republic of China to advance their respective or 
     joint military and security strategies in the Arctic by:
       (1) Exploiting Arctic science and technology cooperation, 
     agreements, or research partnerships for military or 
     intelligence purposes; or
       (2) Co-opting, manipulating, or undermining Arctic-focused 
     multilateral organizations, non-government organizations, or

     associated with the employment of unmanned aerial systems, 
     including loitering munitions otherwise known as ``suicide'' 
     or ``kamikaze'' drones.

     Report on Department of Defense role in supporting 
         international legal operations
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1284) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     provide a report on Department of Defense support for whole-
     of-government efforts to identify and expose malign actors'

       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We are concerned that foreign interpretations or 
     applications of law that deliberately challenge the rules-
     based international order, such as those of the People's 
     Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Islamic 
     Republic of Iran, and the Democratic People's Republic of 
     Korea, may directly or indirectly undermine the national 
     security interests of the United States and its allies and 
     partners.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a 
     briefing, not later than 180 days after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, to the congressional defense 
     committees assessing the nature and effect of any foreign 
     interpretation or application of law that deliberately 
     challenges the rules-based international order and that 
     materially undermines the national security interests of the 
     United States and its allies and partners.
       The briefing should include a description of the 
     methodology that the Department of Defense uses to determine 
     whether:
       (1) Foreign interpretations or applications of law that 
     deliberately challenge the rules-based international order 
     are directly or indirectly counter to the national security 
     interests of the United States and its allies and partners;
       (2) The effects of any such foreign interpretations or 
     applications of law materially undermine the national 
     security interests of the United States and its allies and 
     partners; and
       (3) Challenges posed by any such foreign interpretations or 
     applications of law that materially undermine the national 
     security interests of the United States and its allies and 
     partners can be mitigated through Department of Defense 
     support for whole-of-government efforts.

     implementation.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement includes the House provision with a 
     clarifying amendment.
       We note that the diversity, age and complexity of 
     Department of Defense (DOD) information technology (IT) 
     systems poses a unique challenge to creating a truly 
     integrated, interoperable and efficient information network 
     capable of operating at speeds and with the adaptability to 
     outpace and out-decide our adversaries. The length of time 
     many key DOD information technology systems have remained in 
     use, as well the centrality of many of these systems around 
     which new capabilities have to be added and upgraded, is a 
     unique engineering challenge. Just as an example, the 
     reliance on outmoded and antiquated data formats such as 
     Extensible Markup Language, Variable Message Format, Tactical 
     Data Links, or Tactical Digital Information Links, means that 
     many systems cannot take full advantage of technological 
     capabilities of new artificial intelligence, data processing, 
     or bandwidth efficient components, effectively self-limiting 
     performance gains for our warfighters.
       We believe a better understanding of where DOD IT systems 
     are reliant on such formats and a concerted plan to identify 
     and address the risks from such formats is a critical first 
     step to make a truly integrated and effective data fabric for 
     the Department.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 1606).
       The agreement includes the House provision with a 
     clarifying amendment.
       We note that finding the optimal structure for cyber 
     operations continues to be a work in progress. We also 
     recognize that such evolution is even more difficult when 
     those forces are fully engaged in a demanding training 
     environment, competition with the private sector for a 
     limited workforce pool, and complicated by a constant, 
     demanding and high intensity operational tempo. We believe 
     that an independent, outside examination of these challenge 
     may provide valuable insights to inform decision-makers on 
     future force design concepts.
       In executing the study required by the section, we 
     encourage the National Academies to leverage fully the 
     findings from previous relevant assessments, analyses, and 
     studies conducted by the Secretary of Defense, the 
     Comptroller General of the United States, or other entities, 
     as well as lessons learned from the creation of Space Force, 
     and from the establishment of foreign partner cyber 
     organizations. We also encourage them to seek views and 
     perspectives of members of the Armed Forces in the Department 
     of Defense, across grades and specialties in cyber, to better 
     understand the historical performance and efficacy of the 
     Armed Forces in the Department of Defense in devising and 
     implementing recruitment and retention policies in the cyber 
     field.
       We observe that the study required will be a major 
     challenge for participants within the National Academies, 
     some of whom may not have deep operational experience in 
     military cyber missions. Scoping the study to focus on key 
     questions will be critical, and we recognize that the 
     participants should have the flexibility to pursue topics 
     based on their collective judgement. While this list is not 
     intended to be exhaustive or directive, we do hope it will 
     provide some loose vectoring that will help them as they 
     develop their study approach.
       As part of this study, we encourage the National Academies 
     panel to examine some or all of the following issues, 
     including:
       (1) What is the optimal force size of qualified cyber 
     professionals to satisfy existing and projected requirements 
     of the Department of Defense, and how are these variables 
     most likely to change?
       (2) Does the Department have an adequate delineation of 
     which fields are cyber-relevant, and how might this be most 
     likely to change?
       (3) Is the Department's current understanding and 
     definition of cyber operations adequate to future challenges 
     and opportunities?
       (4) What options exist to improve training requirements, 
     outputs, and programs in support of cyberspace operations?
       (5) How could the Department improve recruiting and 
     retention of qualified officers and enlisted members of the 
     Armed Forces in the Department of Defense in cyberspace 
     operations and related and supporting fields?
       (6) How might the Department better utilize reserve 
     component forces in support of cyberspace operations?
       (7) What approaches could improve force readiness?
       (8) How should the Department structure itself for 
     acquisition and provision of cyber capabilities in support of 
     cyberspace operations?
       (9) How should the Department approach compensation, 
     including pay and other benefits, among military members and 
     civilians serving in and qualified for work roles in support 
     of cyberspace operations, especially in light of competition 
     with the private sector, and how should this approach be 
     common with or differ from those for other high-demand work 
     roles?
       (10) How could the Department improve professional military 
     education content and curricula focused on the cyber domain?
       (11) Does increased optimization for cyberspace operations 
     incur cost, risk, efficiency, or other tradeoffs to other 
     missions and responsibilities of the Department, or elsewhere 
     within the national security community?

     definitions of foreign mobile applications of concern with 
     respect to personnel or operations of the Department of 
     Defense, distinguishing among categories such as applications 
     for shopping, social media, entertainment, or health; and 
     create a risk framework with respect to Department personnel 
     or operations that assesses each foreign mobile application 
     (or, if appropriate, grouping of similar such applications) 
     that is from a country of concern for any potential impact on 
     Departmental personnel and Departmental operations.

                   LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED

     Access to national suicide prevention and mental health 
         crisis hotline system
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1533) that would 
     require the Department of Defense (DOD) Chief Information 
     Officer to implement access to the national suicide

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that all DOD Defense Service Network (DSN) phones 
     now have the ability to access the Veteran's Crisis Line 
     (988) from anyplace on the globe without dialing any 
     additional digit. We also note that the national suicide 
     prevention and mental health crisis hotline system does not 
     currently transmit detailed caller location, like a 911 call, 
     and that 988 geolocation poses significant challenges--most 
     notably time and funding.
       We therefore direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a 
     briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate 
     and the House of Representatives, not later than June 1, 
     2025, describing the approximate cost and timeline required 
     to modernize DOD systems to facilitate geolocated 988 
     services for DSN phones. Such briefing should address issues 
     related to architecture, manpower, implementation timelines, 
     funding, and interoperability.

     liberties of United States persons are protected in the 
     conduct of military cyber operations, and submit the findings 
     of that assessment to Congress.
       We also agree that the assessment conducted by the

     for several years that the backlog of requests has hindered 
     the ability of the relevant committees to properly exercise 
     oversight of this critical and dynamic domain. We note the 
     ASD(CP)'s promising efforts to institutionalize the processes 
     in a short time frame, and are optimistic about such efforts 
     in the future. While we remain concerned that such a 
     legislative backlog could develop again in the future, we are 
     optimistic that the focus of the ASD (CP) can ensure that 
     legislative requirements are afforded the proper levels of 
     attention going forward. We look forward to continued 
     engagement and partnership on these topics in the future.

[[Page H6687]]

       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
     clarifying amendment that would require the establishment of 
     a dedicated cyber intelligence capability rather than a 
     center.
       We note our continued support for the establishment of a 
     cyber intelligence capability within the Department of 
     Defense. We recognize that there are pockets of people with 
     useful analytical expertise spread across the existing 
     service intelligence centers that will have valuable 
     experience and analytic contributions to the cyber 
     intelligence mission, so the idea that such contributions may 
     go beyond any single center is understandable. We believe 
     that as the Department formulates a plan for addressing this 
     provision, it is important to carefully consider what 
     constitutes a ``cyber intelligence capability.'' We believe 
     that capability should include existing centers where 
     relevant expertise exists, but should also focus 
     fundamentally on how to build and maintain the new and 
     emerging types of technical knowledge and expertise that is 
     needed by the cyber operations community, but that does not 
     currently exist anywhere in the Department in the scale or 
     depth that is required. Based on recent experience and the 
     emerging results from current cyber pilots, we do not believe 
     that existing all-source intelligence centers alone will be 
     sufficient for the intelligence needs of cyber operators in 
     the future.
     Sec. 1613--Authority of Army Counterintelligence Agents
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1612) that would

     provide special agents of the Army Counterintelligence 
     Command with the authority to execute warrants and make 
     arrests.
       A proposed amendment (amendment number 3290) to the Senate 
     committee-reported bill contained a similar provision (sec. 
     6541) that would provide the same authority, but would 
     further terminate this authority 4 years after enactment of 
     this Act. The Senate provision would also require annual 
     briefings on the Army's use of this authority.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
     technical amendment.
     Sec. 1614--Extension and modification of defense intelligence 
         and counterintelligence expense authority
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1042) that would 
     extend the authorization from section 1057 of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 
     116-92) for the expenditure of funds for Department of 
     Defense intelligence and counterintelligence activities from 
     2025 to 2030 and increase the amount of expenditures the 
     Secretary of Defense may delegate from $100,000 to $125,000.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a similar 
     provision (sec. 1543).
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with an 
     amendment that would codify section 1057 of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 
     116-92) for the expenditure of funds for Department of 
     Defense intelligence and counterintelligence activities as 
     section 429a of title 10, United States Code, and increase 
     the amount of expenditures the Secretary of Defense may 
     delegate from $100,000 to $200,000.
     Sec. 1615--Intelligence advice and Department of Defense 
         support for Government of Israel in the defeat of Hamas
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1546) that would require the Secretary of Defense and 
     the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency to provide 
     the Government of Israel defense intelligence, advice, and 
     support to the extent practicable, and consistent with United 
     States objectives, to support Israel's pursuit of the lasting 
     defeat of Hamas, and to assist Israel in either capturing or 
     killing senior Hamas officials.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with a 
     clarifying amendment.

                       Subtitle C--Nuclear Forces

     Sec. 1621--Establishment of Assistant Secretary of Defense 
         for Nuclear Deterrence, Chemical, and Biological Defense 
         Policy and Programs; improvements to processes of the 
         Office of the Secretary of Defense
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1525) that would amend section 138(b)(4) of title 10, 
     United States Code, to restructure the position of the 
     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and 
     Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)) into the Assistant 
     Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Deterrence Policy and 
     Programs; and consolidate the principal policymaking, 
     programmatic, and resourcing responsibilities for U.S. 
     nuclear forces within the Office of the Secretary of 
     Defense into the restructured office.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement includes the Senate provision with amendments 
     that adjust the scope of responsibilities, change the name of 
     the position to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear 
     Deterrence, Chemical, and Biological Defense Policy and 
     Programs, as well as other technical and conforming 
     amendments.
       We note that the Department of Defense is in the process of 
     modernizing and evolving the U.S. nuclear deterrent to adapt 
     to changing international security conditions. We agree that 
     such efforts should not be substantially perturbed by lengthy 
     delays in implementing this adjustment to the organizational 
     oversight structure for the Office of the Secretary of 
     Defense. In order to minimize disruption, we believe that the 
     reorganized office should utilize the existing, purely 
     administrative support relationships (e.g., human resources, 
     budgeting, etc.) of an existing office of the Office of the 
     Secretary of Defense to the maximum extent practicable. We 
     also note that this reorganization is intended in part to 
     better provide the Secretary of Defense and their staff with 
     the policy, programmatic, operational, and resourcing 
     information required to fully execute the responsibilities of 
     principal civilian adviser for nuclear issues and expect 
     Department of Defense Components will ensure such information 
     is provided in a complete and transparent manner. We direct 
     the Secretary of Defense to brief the congressional defense 
     committees on interim steps to implement the changes directed 
     by this provision by March 1, 2025, and brief the committees 
     on final implementation measures not later than July 1, 2025.
     Sec. 1622--Extension and modification of certifications 
         regarding integrated tactical warning and attack 
         assessment mission of the Department of the Air Force
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision

       (5) Mechanisms through which the Space Force may use 
     existing funding to accelerate the rapid adoption of 
     capabilities and life-cycle sustainment efforts to quickly 
     modernize the satellite control network.
     Preparations for possible deployment of additional 
         intercontinental ballistic missiles
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1516) that would require the Secretary of the Air Force 
     to develop a plan for deploying up to 450 Sentinel 
     intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), rather than the 
     400 Minuteman III ICBMs currently deployed; and direct the

     and Department of Defense Field Activities;
       (2) An assessment of any duplication of effort or gaps 
     identified in paragraph (1);
       (3) A recommendation with respect to designating a single 
     entity with acquisition authority with respect to the 
     capability to defend the homeland from hypersonic threats; 
     and
       (4) Such other matters as the Secretary considers relevant.
     Sense of Congress on the development of very low earth orbit 
         spacecraft
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1609B) that 
     would express the sense of Congress that the Department of 
     Defense should continue to construct a hybrid space 
     architecture that integrates advanced commercial technologies 
     for very low earth orbit spacecraft.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We find that:
       (1) The Space Force has demonstrated its commitment to 
     building a resilient, safe, and secure space architecture and 
     incorporating transformational commercially developed space 
     technologies to accelerate the fielding of capabilities, 
     including in very low earth orbit;
       (2) Advancements in propulsion systems, materials science, 
     affordable launch costs, and orbital management techniques 
     have opened up new possibilities for utilizing very low earth 
     orbit for various purposes, including ultra-high-resolution 
     reconnaissance, low latency communication, and improved space 
     domain awareness;
       (3) Congress and the Department of Defense should continue 
     to pursue these efforts in support of the National Defense 
     Strategy and the Commercial Space Strategy of the Space Force 
     to accelerate the purposeful pursuit of hybrid space 
     architectures; and
       (4) The Space Force should continue to scale up these 
     efforts and further explore the benefits of very low earth 
     orbit spacecraft development to improve responsiveness, 
     enhance image resolution, generate orbital diversity, and 
     increase resilience against space debris and other threats.
     Report on Space Force use of nuclear thermal propulsion and 
         nuclear electric propulsion space vehicles
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1609C) that 
     would require the Chief of Space Operations to provide a 
     report on Space Force use of nuclear thermal propulsion and 
     nuclear electric propulsion space vehicles.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We direct the Chief of Space Operations to provide a 
     briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later 
     than March 31, 2025, on the Space Force use of nuclear 
     thermal propulsion and nuclear electric propulsion space 
     vehicles to include:
       (1) Description of how the Space Force uses such vehicles 
     currently and plans to use such vehicles in the future; and
       (2) Potential benefits that such vehicles can provide to 
     bolster the national security of the United States.
     Sensitive compartmented information facility accreditation
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1613) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to assign responsibility to 
     the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency for the 
     accreditation of sensitive compartmented information 
     facilities for all components of the Department of Defense 
     (DOD)--including the military departments, except with 
     respect to the National Security Agency, the National 
     Reconnaissance Office, and the National Geospatial-
     Intelligence Agency.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We remain concerned that the current processes for 
     accrediting and reaccrediting secure compartmented 
     information facilities (SCIF), while vitally necessary, may 
     also contribute to backlogs in work and nearly insurmountable 
     barriers for many small and nontraditional defense companies. 
     Many of the concerns regarding backlogs and unnecessarily 
     extended timelines to achieve accreditation or 
     reaccreditation are based on anecdotal evidence. However, 
     valid, comprehensive and longitudinal data on the scope and 
     the scale of the problem has been difficult to ascertain. We 
     believe that a comprehensive data collection program centered 
     on this process, similar to the development and measurement 
     of procurement administrative lead time to baseline the 
     acquisition process, is necessary before considering any 
     potentially disruptive organizational changes.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense, through the 
     Department of Defense Performance Improvement Officer in 
     coordination with the Undersecretary of Defense for 
     Intelligence and Security, to provide a briefing, not later 
     than June 1, 2025, to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives on the Department's 
     activities to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of the 
     SCIF accreditation and reaccreditation processes across the 
     Department of Defense. The briefing should include:
       (1) Current data, including baseline goals or benchmarks, 
     for the timelines for conducting SCIF accreditation and 
     reaccreditation by Department of Defense components with 
     delegated responsibility for accreditation actions;
       (2) Identification of gaps in such data collection, and 
     plans to close such gaps;
       (3) Development of measurable goals or other benchmarks for 
     delegated components to identify bottlenecks in the process 
     and close gaps in data collection and data quality;
       (4) Recommendations for improving input, data or other 
     feedback from entities undergoing the accreditation or 
     reaccreditation process in order to identify process 
     improvements that may decrease timelines and increase quality 
     of the outputs of the process; and
       (5) Recommendations for policy improvements or policy 
     guidance needed to institutionalize such data collection and 
     process improvements, including through the use of databases, 
     automated analysis tools or other automation to streamline 
     data collection, analysis and transparency.
     Resilience of position, navigation, and timing technologies 
         and services
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 1509) that would require any position, navigation, and 
     timing technology and service procured, or otherwise acquired 
     by the Department of Defense, to be able to acquire, track, 
     and provide accurate position, navigation, or timing 
     information when L1 Signals or L2 Signals are jammed, 
     spoofed, blocked, or subject to harmful interference.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We note that the Department of Defense despite more than a 
     decade of congressional direction, delays, and billions in 
     cost overruns continues to resist adequately addressing the 
     resilient position, navigation, and timing needs of the 
     services. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383) directed the 
     Department of Defense to transition all receivers to the more 
     resilient M-Code, and this has still not happened. Modern 
     resilient Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites still do 
     not have secure ground architecture fielded, despite several 
     years of work and a Nunn-McCurdy breach.
       Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense to provide an 
     assessment accompanied by a briefing to the Committees on 
     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, not later than June 1, 2025, on the status 
     of fielding resilient position, navigation, and timing 
     technology and service across the Department.
       The assessment and briefing shall include:
       (1) Feasibility, projected cost, and timeline to require 
     all position, navigation, and timing technology and service 
     procured or otherwise acquired by the Department of Defense 
     to have the ability to acquire, track, and provide accurate 
     position, navigation, or timing information if L1 Signals and 
     L2 Signals are jammed, spoofed, blocked, or subject to 
     harmful interference;
       (2) Status of M-Code resilient receiver deliveries to the 
     weapons systems and people that require them, to include a 
     plan to field these receivers on an operationally relevant 
     timeline;
       (3) Current schedule and status of full operational 
     capability of the ground station to GPS III/F, the advanced 
     GPS satellite transmitting M-Code, known as OCX;
       (4) Plans to include commercial position, navigation, and 
     timing technologies in future DOD resilient precision, 
     navigation, and timing efforts; and
       (5) Update on any efforts to incorporate non-traditional 
     and non-space-based resilient position, navigation, and 
     timing information into DOD operations.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     Africa. USAFRICOM is committed to building strategic 
     partnerships with African partners and bolstering stability 
     on the continent. One critical component of such efforts is 
     institutional capacity building (ICB) programing that helps 
     partners strengthen governance in the defense sectors and 
     reinforce shared commitments to democracy, transparency, and 
     the rule of law. We encourage the Department of Defense to 
     ensure ICB efforts remain a critical component of all 
     security cooperation programs.

     the Governments of Iran, the People's Republic of China, and 
     Russia. Therefore, we direct the Secretary of Defense, in 
     consultation with the Secretary of State, to provide a

     sold at military operated establishments are compliant with 
     federal tobacco regulations including the Federal Food, Drug 
     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.). The briefing should 
     also include the process the Department has implemented to 
     ensure that all non-Department of Defense retail 
     establishments located on installations, including kiosks and 
     third-party vendors on military installations, are in 
     compliance with the aforementioned regulations.

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     installations were cancelled after the Department of Defense 
     (DOD) learned about them during a House Armed Services 
     Committee hearing on March 29, 2023. DOD determined that 
     permitting non-Federal entities to conduct drag show events 
     at U.S. military installations or facilities is inconsistent 
     with the longstanding criteria for providing this logistical 
     support to non-federal entities, including DOD Instruction 
     1000.15, ``Procedures and Support for Non-Federal Entities 
     Authorized to Operate on DOD Installations'' and the Joint 
     Ethics Regulation (JER) section 3-211, ``Logistical Support 
     of Non-Federal Entity Events.'' The JER states that heads of 
     DOD component organizations may provide, on a limited basis, 
     logistical support (use of DOD facilities and equipment) to 
     non-Federal entity events, but only if they determine seven 
     factors to ensure that the support may be authorized as

     supporting legitimate DOD interests. The DOD Office of 
     General Counsel determined that drag queen story hours did 
     not serve a legitimate DOD public affairs interest nor was 
     this an appropriate association for DOD.

       We note the importance of protecting our small business 
     industrial base against cyber attacks from the full spectrum 
     of cyber actors, from simple criminal and ransomware attacks 
     to sophisticated national state campaigns. With the 
     finalization of the rules for the Cybersecurity Maturity 
     Model Certification, we believe it is important that the 
     Department of Defense provide additional assistance to small 
     businesses in the defense industrial base navigating this 
     process. We believe such assistance crucial to the more 
     fundamental need to strengthen the overall cyber defense 
     posture of this vulnerable sector.
       We are aware that the Department has some dedicated 
     programs specific to this issue, such as Project Spectrum, 
     but also note efforts undertaken by Defense Cyber Crime 
     Center and the National Security Agency's Cyber Collaboration 
     Center, among others, that provide various forms of 
     assistance to this community. We believe that the Department 
     should provide comprehensive and coordinated guidance to the 
     military services and defense agencies and field activities 
     in order to ensure unity of effort, reduce opportunities for 
     unwarranted duplication across investments, and simplify 
     entry points into the Department for those seeking to obtain 
     such support.

     according to the Department of Defense, no academic 
     institutions that receive Department of Defense funding host 
     a Confucius Institute as of the summer of 2023. While one 
     Confucius Institute remains in the United States, it resides

       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that Kenya is a key partner in addressing a range 
     of shared threats and advancing stability and security in 
     East Africa and beyond. In recognition of the close and 
     continuing partnership between the United States and Kenya, 
     the United States recently named Kenya a major non-NATO ally, 
     the first such designation for a country in sub-Saharan 
     Africa. We commend Kenya for continuing to play a critical 
     role in regional security, including hosting Justified 
     Accord, U.S. Africa Command's largest exercise in East 
     Africa, and serving as lead nation for the multilateral 
     United Nations mission to help stabilize Haiti. We 
     encourage the Department of Defense to continue efforts to 
     identify opportunities to deepen collaboration.

     power for direct military purposes and as a soft power tool 
     globally.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with

     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives, not later than June 1, 2025, on any Russian 
     and Chinese efforts related to transportable nuclear power 
     that specifically evaluates the manner and extent to which, 
     if any, both Russia and China are using transportable nuclear 
     power for military purposes and as a soft power tool 
     globally.
     Reporting on Iranian Centrifuge Installation
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1736) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to provide a report on 
     Iranian centrifuge installation.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar

       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to

       (1) An assessment of the types and numbers of centrifuges 
     installed in declared and undeclared nuclear facilities in 
     Iran since May 2021;
       (2) An assessment of the timeline required by Iran to 
     produce weapons-grade uranium;
       (3) An assessment of the current timeline required by Iran 
     to produce weapons-grade uranium;
       (4) An assessment of whether Iran has moved advanced 
     centrifuges to facilities other than its safeguarded 
     enrichment plants, including where and how many, if 
     applicable;
       (5) An assessment of how many advanced centrifuges Iran 
     would need of each type to enrich to weapons-grade; and
       (6) An assessment of whether a heavily fortified nuclear 
     facility Iran is building near the Natanz site contains or 
     will contain an enrichment plant.
     Revocation of Security Clearances for Certain Persons
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1751) that would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to suspend or revoke a 
     security clearance or access to classified information for 
     any retired or separated member of the uniformed service or 
     civilian employee of the Department of Defense who engages in 
     certain activities.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that the current security clearance forms for 
     initiating a background investigation already include 
     questions on support for foreign entities, and the 
     implementation of continuous vetting procedures allows for 
     updates in between periodic reinvestigations to accommodate 
     dynamic developments in near real time. Any individual 
     holding a security clearance is responsible for being 
     forthcoming and transparent in notifying the government of 
     changes in information that might impact their ability to 
     hold and maintain classified information, so that this 
     continuous vetting process can remain agile and responsive. 
     We believe lobbying for foreign entities requires review and 
     oversight by the Department, and it is appropriate to 
     continue to place focus on these questions during the 
     adjudication process.
     Rewards for information regarding leaders of Hamas
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1760) that would

     roles on the Foreign Threat Intelligence Committee to request 
     the Rewards for Justice Program to offer $25.0 million each 
     in incentives for information regarding certain leaders of 
     Hamas.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We note that Hamas terrorists Yahya Sinwar and Mohamed 
     Deif, who were responsible for planning the October 7 
     massacre, have been killed. We support making rewards 
     available under the Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program for 
     information that leads to the arrest, location, or financial 
     disruption of Hamas leaders or operatives responsible for the 
     murder and kidnapping of Americans on October 7, 2023.

     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.
       We acknowledge receipt of the 2023 feasibility study and 
     subsequent 2024 report conducted for the Blue Grass Chemical 
     Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant at the Blue Grass Army Depot 
     (BGAD), which identified critical opportunities for 
     augmenting the Organic Industrial Base. These reports 
     identified three high-feasibility growth opportunities: 
     production of critical chemicals, production of metal 
     components for 155mm artillery munitions, and production of 
     metal shipping containers. Moreover, we recognize the 
     strategic importance of the BGAD as a vital element of the 
     defense industrial base. Its unique capabilities in munitions 
     handling and production are crucial for supporting U.S. 
     military readiness. BGAD plays a pivotal role in ensuring the 
     safe, efficient storage and transportation of critical 
     defense materials, making it indispensable to the nation's 
     defense infrastructure.
     State and local law enforcement access to lifesaving Federal 
         equipment
       The House bill contained a provision (sec. 1753) that would 
     prohibit the limitation of the sale, donation, or transfer of 
     property of the U.S. Government to state and local law 
     enforcement agencies.

     commanders of the geographic combatant commands and the

     supporting law enforcement related to counternarcotics.
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained no similar 
     provision.
       The agreement does not include the House provision.

     federally funded research and development center to conduct 
     an independent review, assessment, and analysis of the 
     governance structure and strategy of the counter-narcotics 
     and counter-transnational organized crime activities of the 
     Department of Defense, and, upon receipt of that assessment,

     lodging and meals when a service member and their family 
     occupy temporary lodging during a permanent change of

     of days TLE may be authorized from 10 to 14 days when moving 
     to a permanent duty station (PDS) in the United States and 
     from 5 to 7 days when moving to a PDS outside of the 
     continental United States. The changes also allow for 
     installations, bases, or commands to request an additional 
     authorization of a TLE extension where shortages persist past 
     14 days in the continental United States. We will continue to 
     monitor the impact of increased TLE on alleviating housing 
     shortages for servicemembers and their families.

     that a tenant or prospective tenant of a privatized housing 
     unit sign a nondisclosure agreement.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
     Report on use of areawide contracts to procure utility 
         services
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 2847) that would require the Secretary of Defense to 
     submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives on what projects, to 
     include any savings or mission capabilities, have been 
     conducted pursuant to section 2811(b) of the National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118-31).
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to 
     the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House 
     of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2025, on what 
     projects have been conducted pursuant to section 2811(b) of 
     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 
     (Public Law 118-31). The briefing shall include, at a

     Infrastructure Program (DCIP) projects for which a grant was 
     awarded and that are still in progress as of the date of the 
     briefing.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
       We are concerned that the current definition of military 
     value as it has been applied to the analysis of DCIP 
     proposals has led to a more narrow application of the program 
     than originally intended, causing challenges for the DCIP 
     review boards, military services, and DCIP applicants. 
     Authorized in section 2861 of the National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232), 
     DCIP was intended to be a competitive authority to assist in 
     supplementing funds for State and local governments in 
     addressing deficiencies in community infrastructure. Due to 
     the limitations associated with the military value 
     requirements and funding constraints, important, high-value 
     projects that meet other DCIP criteria often go unfunded.
       We direct the Secretary of Defense to brief the Committees 
     on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
     no later than March 31, 2025, on: (1) The number of repeat 
     applicants DCIP has seen since 2020; (2) The number of 
     applicants who did not meet the military value requirements 
     since 2020; (3) The methodology by which the military value 
     criteria has been applied to DCIP applicants; and (4) Any 
     other challenges that DCIP has identified in regard to the 
     military value criteria, and any recommendations for 
     adjustments to improve the process.

         to include installations of the Coast Guard
       The Senate committee-reported bill contained a provision 
     (sec. 2856) that would amend section 2391 of title 10, United 
     States Code, to allow the United States Coast Guard to 
     compete for funding available through the Defense Community 
     Infrastructure Program.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.
     Modification of annual report on privatized military housing
       A proposed amendment (amendment number 3290) to the Senate 
     committee-reported bill contained a provision (sec. 7823) 
     that would modify the annual report on privatized military 
     housing by requiring the Secretary of Defense to publish the 
     report on a publicly available website of the Department of 
     Defense not later than 30 days after submitting a report.
       The House bill contained no similar provision.
       The agreement does not include the Senate provision.

  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS AND TRANSMITTAL FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
                                APPROVAL

                                          U.S. Congress, Office of


                               Congressional Workplace Rights,

                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Johnson,
     Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, The 
         United States Capitol, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: Section 207(d) of the Congressional 
     Accountability Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1316b(d), requires the 
     Board of Directors of the Office of Congressional Workplace 
     Rights (Board) to issue substantive regulations implementing 
     section 207 of the CAA relating to the Fair Chance to Compete 
     for Jobs Act of 2019.
       Section 304(b)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(3), requires 
     that, with regard to substantive regulations under the CAA, 
     after the Board has published a general notice of proposed 
     rulemaking as required by subsection (b)(1) and received 
     comments pursuant to subsection (b)(2), ``the Board shall 
     adopt regulations and shall transmit notice of such action 
     together with a copy of such regulations to the Speaker of 
     the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of 
     the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the 
     first day on which both Houses are in session following such 
     transmittal.''
       The Board has adopted the regulations in the Notice of 
     Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Transmittal for 
     Congressional Approval, which accompany this transmittal 
     letter. The Board requests that the accompanying Notice be 
     published in the House version of the Congressional Record on 
     the first day on which both Houses are in session following 
     receipt of this transmittal. The Board has adopted the same 
     regulations for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and 
     the other covered entities and facilities, and therefore 
     recommends that the adopted regulations be approved by 
     concurrent resolution of the Congress.
       Any inquiries regarding this notice should be addressed to 
     Martin J. Crane, Executive Director of the Office of 
     Congressional Workplace Rights, Room LA-200, 110 Second 
     Street SE, Washington, DC 20540-1999; 202-724-9250.
           Sincerely,

                                       Barbara Childs Wallace,

                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,
                         Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.

 FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE 
                                 RIGHTS

  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS AND TRANSMITTAL FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
                                APPROVAL

Regulations Implementing Certain Substantive Rights and Protections for 
    Job Applicants, as Required by Section 207 of the Congressional 
                     Accountability Act (``CAA'').

   Notice of Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Submission for 
        Approval as Required by 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b of the CAA.

     Procedural Summary:
     Issuance of the Board's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
       The Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019 (``FCA'') 
     was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for 2020 (H. Rept. 116-333, Title XI, Sections 1121-1124). 
     Under the FCA, Federal employers (including employing offices 
     in the legislative branch) may not request from most job 
     applicants information on arrest and conviction history until 
     a conditional job offer has been extended. Congress applied 
     the FCA to the legislative branch by amending the CAA to add 
     a new section 207, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b.
       On June 13, 2024, the Board of Directors (``Board'') of the 
     Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (``OCWR'') published 
     a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the 
     Congressional Record. 170 Cong. Rec. H4056-02, S4091-04 
     (daily ed. June 13, 2024). The NPR proposed substantive 
     regulations relating to implementation of the FCA in the 
     legislative branch. The Board, now having considered comments 
     to the NPR, has adopted, and is submitting for approval by 
     the Congress, final substantive regulations implementing 
     section 207 of the CAA.
     Why did the Board propose these substantive regulations?
       Section 207(d) of the CAA requires the Board to issue 
     substantive regulations implementing section 207. Section 
     207(d) requires the Board's regulations to be:
       the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the 
     Director of the Office of Personnel Management . . . except 
     to the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause 
     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a 
     modification of such regulations would be more effective for 
     the implementation of the rights and protections under this 
     section.
     What procedure followed the Board's Notice of Proposed 
         Rulemaking?
       The NPR included a 30-day comment period, which began on 
     June 13, 2024. The Board received three sets of comments to 
     the proposed substantive regulations. The Board has reviewed 
     these comments, made certain changes to its proposed 
     substantive regulations in response to the comments, adopted 
     final substantive regulations, and is submitting them for 
     approval by Congress pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 
     U.S.C. Sec. 1384.
     What is the effect of the Board's adoption of these 
         substantive regulations?
       Adoption of these substantive regulations by the Board does 
     not complete the promulgation process. Pursuant to section 
     304, following the Board's adoption of the regulations, it 
     must transmit notice of such action together with the 
     regulations and a recommendation regarding the method for 
     Congressional approval of the regulations to the Speaker of 
     the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate for 
     publication in the Congressional Record. This Notice of 
     Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Submission for 
     Congressional Approval completes this step.
     What are the next steps in the process of promulgation of 
         these regulations?
       Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, the Board is 
     required to ``include a recommendation in the general notice 
     of proposed rulemaking and in the regulations as to whether 
     the regulations should be approved by resolution of the 
     Senate, by resolution of the House of Representatives, by 
     concurrent resolution, or by joint resolution.'' The Board 
     has adopted the same regulations for the Senate, the House of 
     Representatives, and the other covered entities and 
     facilities, and the Board recommends that the adopted 
     regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the 
     Congress.
     Are these substantive regulations also recommended by OCWR's 
         Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director for the 
         Senate, and the Deputy Executive Director for the House 
         of Representatives?
       As required by section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, these 
     substantive regulations are recommended by the Deputy 
     Director for the Senate in regard to regulations under 
     subsection (a)(2)(B)(i), the Deputy Director for the House of 
     Representatives in regard to regulations under subsection 
     (a)(2)(B)(ii), and the Executive Director for regulations 
     under subsection (a)(2)(B)(iii).
     Has the Board previously adopted substantive regulations 
         implementing 
         2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b?
       No.
     Are these substantive regulations available to persons with 
         disabilities in an alternate format?
       This Notice is available on the OCWR's website, 
     www.ocwr.gov, which is compliant with Section 508 of the 
     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794d. 
     This Notice can also be made available in large print, 
     braille, or other alternative format. Requests for this 
     Notice in an alternative format should be made to the Office 
     of Congressional Workplace Rights, 202-724-9250 (voice); 202-
     426-1913 (fax); or ADAaccess@ocwr.gov (e-mail).
     The Board's Responses to Comments Received
       The Board received comments from three sources. The 
     comments addressed four major points, and one commenter also 
     proposed a number of minor corrections, most of which the 
     Board has incorporated.
     Political Appointees
       The FCA directs the Office of Personnel Management 
     (``OPM'') to issue regulations identifying positions in the 
     executive branch with respect to which the prohibitions under 
     subsection (a) of the Act shall not apply. OPM's substantive 
     regulations thus provide at 5 CFR Sec. 920.201(b)(2) that 
     such prohibitions shall not apply with respect to an 
     applicant for a ``political appointment.'' OPM's regulations 
     define ``political appointment'' at 5 CFR Sec.  920.101:
       Political appointment means an appointment by the President 
     without Senate confirmation (except those appointed under 5 
     CFR 213.3102(c)); an appointment to a position compensated 
     under the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5312 through 5316); an 
     appointment of a White House Fellow to be assigned as an 
     assistant to a top-level Federal officer (5 CFR 213.3102(z)); 
     a Schedule C appointment (5 CFR 213.3301, 213.3302); a 
     noncareer, limited term, or limited emergency Senior 
     Executive Service appointment (5 CFR part 317, subpart F); an 
     appointee to serve in a political capacity under agency-
     specific authority; and a provisional political appointment.
       In the NPR, the Board did not include a parallel exception 
     for political appointments

[[Page H6797]]

     in the legislative branch, noting the lack of hiring 
     authorities for political appointees comparable to those 
     cited by OPM for the executive branch.
       Two commenters, however, urged the Board to include an 
     exception for ``political appointments'' in the legislative 
     branch, contending that the omission of such a definition 
     would expand the scope of the FCA for the legislative branch 
     beyond its scope in the executive branch, in a manner 
     inconsistent with section 207(b)(1)(A) of the CAA.
       Both commenters referenced OPM's reasoning for its own 
     exception as set forth in its notice of proposed rulemaking:
       The Fair Chance Act applies to applicants to positions in 
     the ``civil service,'' which, under 5 U.S.C. 2101(1), extends 
     to ``all appointive positions'' in the executive branch. 
     Proposed paragraph (b) makes an exception for applicants for 
     political appointments, since political appointees provide 
     confidential, policy-determining, or policy-advocating 
     functions on behalf of the President or presidentially-
     appointed agency heads, and serve as personal advisors and 
     representatives to the President and other senior 
     administration officials. Pre-employment criminal history 
     screening may be required for these positions prior to a 
     conditional offer of employment, because of the utmost trust 
     and discretion required in these positions and the potential 
     for adverse publicity associated with unfit applicants.
     Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs, 87 Fed. Reg. 24885-01, 24894 
     (Apr. 27, 2022).
       The commenters also stressed the inherently political 
     nature of congressional employment, noting that many 
     appointees are hired to perform confidential, policy-
     determining, and policy-advocating functions on behalf of 
     Members of Congress. One commenter noted in particular that 
     section 502 of the CAA explicitly allows consideration of 
     ``party affiliation'' and ``political compatibility with the 
     employing office'' for employment with a committee, a member, 
     or a number of other offices in the House or Senate. Another 
     commenter argued that a definition of ``political 
     appointment'' was necessary to ``ensure employing office 
     employees have pre-offer access to applicant criminal history 
     information on par with Executive Branch employees' access to 
     such information.''
       Upon further consideration, the Board agrees with the 
     commenters that good cause exists to modify rather than omit 
     OPM's exception for applicants for political appointments. 
     The Board therefore includes for adoption in its substantive 
     regulations the following definition:
       Political appointment means an appointment to a position in 
     an employing office defined in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9)(A)-(C) 
     that requires the incumbent to: (1) file a report under title 
     I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 
     Sec. 101 et seq.); or (2) perform confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions equivalent to 
     those performed by Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 
     Sec. Sec. 5312 through 5316) or Schedule C (5 CFR Sec. Sec.  
     213.3301-213.3302) appointees in the executive branch.

                                 * * *

       920.201(b)(2). The prohibition under this paragraph (a) 
     shall not apply with respect to an applicant for a political 
     appointment.
       Subparagraph (1) of this definition exempts appointments to 
     employing offices of the House and the Senate listed in 2 
     U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9)(A)-(C) that require the incumbent to file 
     a financial disclosure report under title I of the Ethics in 
     Government Act--the defining characteristic of ``senior 
     staff'' under the CAA. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1416(d)(7). This 
     filing requirement applies to congressional employees whose 
     rate of pay is 120% of the minimum rate of pay for GS-15 of 
     the General Schedule and to individuals who are designated as 
     a ``principal assistant.'' See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  13101, 
     13103. In the Board's view, exempting all such highly-
     compensated senior staff positions in the House and the 
     Senate is on par with OPM's across-the-board exemptions for 
     appointments by the President without Senate confirmation; 
     appointments to a position compensated under the Executive 
     Schedule; and Schedule C appointments.
       Because not all positions performing confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions in the House and 
     Senate fall under the Ethics in Government Act, subparagraph 
     (2) sets forth a functional test to determine whether a non-
     senior staff position falls within the exception for 
     applicants for political appointments. Such positions that 
     require incumbents to perform confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions that are the 
     equivalent to duties of positions under the Executive 
     Schedule or positions appointed under Schedule C would also 
     be excepted political appointments. No commenters contended 
     that a political appointment exception should apply to 
     appointments to employing offices outside of those in the 
     House and Senate. Accordingly, this exception only extends to 
     appointments to employing offices defined in 2 U.S.C. Sec.  
     1301(9)(A)-(C).
     Sensitive National Security Positions
       The FCA, by reference to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 9101(b)(1)(A)(ii) in 
     5 U.S.C. Sec. 9202(c)(1)(A), created an exception for an 
     appointment to sensitive national security duties or 
     positions. OPM included the exception in its section 
     920.201(b)(1)(iii) regulations for any position that:
       Has been designated as a sensitive position under the 
     Position Designation System issued by OPM and the Office of 
     Director of National Intelligence, which describes in greater 
     detail agency requirements for designating positions that 
     could bring about a material adverse effect on the national 
     security.
       The Board was not aware of any positions in the legislative 
     branch that were so designated. However, at the urging of the 
     commenters, the Board has adopted the following exception, 
     incorporating an alternative test for whether a position can 
     be considered ``sensitive'':
       Has been designated as a sensitive position under the 
     Position Designation System issued by OPM and the Office of 
     Director of National Intelligence (or similar authority in 
     the legislative branch), which describes in greater detail 
     agency requirements for designating positions that could 
     bring about a material adverse effect on the national 
     security, or that requires the performance of duties 
     consistent with a national security position as defined in 5 
     CFR Sec. 1400.102.
     Posting Requirement
       OPM's regulations require agencies to publicize the FCA's 
     requirements in its job postings. The Board proposed a 
     similar regulation at section 920.201(c) for job postings in 
     the legislative branch. Two commenters noted, however, that 
     the statutory authority for OPM's regulation is derived from 
     5 U.S.C. Sec. 9203. Because the CAA only incorporates 
     Sec. Sec. 9201(1), (4), and (5), 9202, 9204, and 9206 of 
     title 5, we agree that the Board lacks the statutory 
     authority to adopt such a regulation. Accordingly, we have 
     removed proposed section 920.201(c) from these regulations.
     Definition of Criminal History Record Information
       One commenter urged the Board to revise its definition of 
     ``criminal history record information,'' in section 920.101 
     rather than follow OPM's definition, which merely cited 
     section 9101. The Board does not find good cause to modify 
     OPM's definition.

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God of light and truth, in these tumultuous times, enable our 
Senators to hear Your still, small voice. May this awareness of Your 
presence renew their spirit and lift their vision of what this Nation 
can become by Your grace. May they be people dedicated to moral values 
and determined to live by the highest ethical standards possible.
  Lord, keep them from success that is purchased by deviating from the 
path of wholehearted obedience. Enable them to experience the constancy 
of Your presence so that they will choose the harder right and leave a 
legacy that honors You.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.

                         Chips and Science Act

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, when we passed the bipartisan Chips and 
Science Act 2 years ago, we promised to bring semiconductor 
manufacturing back to our shores, to strengthen our national security, 
and shore up our domestic supply chains. Today, that promise is coming 
to fruition in Upstate New York.
  Micron just finalized, this morning--early this morning--a $6.1 
billion--that is billion, $6.1 billion--award that was made possible by 
the bipartisan Chips and Science law, to bring advanced memory chip 
manufacturing to Upstate New York and to America. Most importantly, 
Micron's Chips award is now locked in. It is signed, sealed, and ready 
to deliver for Central New York, all of Upstate New York, and for 
America.
  Micron's Chips award is more than just a once-in-a-generation 
investment in Upstate New York. It is an investment that will span 
multiple generations, create over 50,000 jobs, and spur historic 
amounts of private investment in the region.
  And the chips Micron will make are essential--essential--for 
America's future. They are critical for our national security, for AI, 
our smart phones, our cars, our computers, and so much else. And the 
benefits go beyond New York.
  This award is also fueling expansion of Micron in Idaho, and, today, 
the Commerce Department has struck yet another deal with Micron to 
expand their Virginia facility. So Micron is investing and expanding in 
States big and small, from coast to coast. This is just the latest in a 
flurry of good news, showing that chip production is expanding in 
America from New Hampshire and New York to Arizona; New Mexico to Ohio.
  That is what Chips and Science is all about: making sure that America 
harnesses all our potential to stay No. 1 in chip manufacturing.
  And when I conceived the Chips and Science bill, I had Upstate New 
York in mind. We knew that manufacturing had left New York, and we 
wanted it to return. And that is now coming to fruition from one end of 
the State to the other. And the I-90 corridor, from Buffalo to Albany, 
will be known as the ``semiconductor superhighway,'' where close to a 
quarter of all chips made in America will be made.

[[Page S6892]]

  It is great news, not only for this generation but for future 
generations, whose kids and grandkids will want to live in Upstate New 
York.

                        Artificial Intelligence

  Mr. President, on artificial intelligence, for more than a year, I 
have worked relentlessly with Senators on both sides of the aisle to 
find a way forward on strong bipartisan AI legislation. I created a 
bipartisan working group with Senators Heinrich, Brown, and Young. With 
the help of many of our chairs and ranking members, we created a never-
before-seen, bipartisan AI Insight Forum--many forums, nine of them--to 
bring top experts from across the country.
  Democrats and Republicans also worked together on writing bills, and 
through hard work, we came to significant compromises that would have 
led to meaningful AI legislation and kept America No. 1 on AI, both in 
keeping innovation our North Star, but making sure there were 
safeguards so that the worst could not happen.
  In fact, Speaker Johnson and I agreed that all our committees should 
keep working together to figure out a way to get AI legislation done 
before the end of the year. We were feeling quite good about that 
until, unfortunately, the November elections occurred, and following 
those elections, Senate Republicans chose to walk away from the 
bipartisan negotiations, abandoning over a year of good-faith hard 
work.
  This is deeply unfortunate because, if we want America to remain the 
technological leader of the 21st Century, we can't turn a blind eye to 
the changes AI will bring, nor can we let AI become a partisan issue. 
That is why I will never walk away from AI talks. I remain committed to 
working with both sides to make AI a top priority here in the Senate.
  As I said, Speaker Johnson and I have had productive talks on AI for 
months, and I am glad to say we are still having those talks with the 
hope of finding opportunities for action in the future. It is not going 
to be easy. It isn't. It is a difficult issue, but we have some 
opportunities to move the ball forward on AI next year.
  I know that many of my Republican colleagues here in this Chamber are 
just as committed as I am to finish the job. There are two Senators I 
would like to thank in particular on the Republican side, Senators 
Young and Rounds, who have been excellent bipartisan partners with 
Senator Heinrich and myself for over a year. I thank them for their 
hard work. I thank their staffs for their hard work and tell them we 
must keep going. We can't let a handful few on this Senate Republican 
side stop us from moving forward on AI.
  Again, no matter how difficult it may be, my commitment to Members in 
both Chambers remains steadfast. I will work with anyone, regardless of 
party, to get meaningful, sustainable, and transformational AI done--
transformational because of what AI could do to cure heart disease, to 
educate young people around the globe, to deal with our climate crisis; 
and sustainable so that we have guardrails that prevent AI if some bad 
force, whether it is a country or a rogue group, get hold of it. We 
would prevent them from doing bad things and keep AI sustainable.
  We must get both done. Our outline and our work are a good step in 
that direction. We must continue to move forward.

                            Disaster Relief

  Mr. President, on disaster aid, in 2024, at least 24 major disasters 
have battered communities across the United States, killing--killing--
over 400 Americans, costing over $60 billion in damages. The true cost 
is certainly higher. These disasters and disasters of recent years have 
left the Federal Government's emergency resources all but depleted.
  So, for the last month, I have worked with my colleagues to try and 
get a comprehensive disaster aid package done before the end of the 
year. I believe we must try as much as possible to get it done, and we 
on the Democratic side have been persistent in getting as many dollars 
as possible to help both blue and red States affected by the disasters.
  I remain hopeful and determined that we can reach a deal with our 
Republican counterparts, but the only way we are going to get a 
disaster package done is with a serious show of bipartisan cooperation. 
That is how the CRs work. Disaster aid is not a Democratic or 
Republican issue whatsoever. Mother Nature comes for us all, as we have 
seen in every part of the country, time and time again.

                              Nominations

  Mr. President, on Senator Rubio, on the topic of nominees, today, I 
will later sit down with the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of 
State, our longtime colleague Senator Marco Rubio. I have known Senator 
Rubio for many years and have worked with him on many issues. So I 
expect we will have a good and productive conversation.
  I look forward to giving him the same fair chance to make his case 
that all nominees, regardless of party, deserve.

                            Senate Business

  Mr. President, on Senate business, we will continue the work of 
confirming more nominations this week. Last night, I filed cloture on 
the nominations of Lauren McFerran and Joshua Ditelberg to sit on the 
NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board.
  Ms. McFerran is a current member of the NLRB, but her term will 
expire soon, unless she is reconfirmed for another 5 years.
  The Senate will take the first votes to advance these NLRB nominees 
on Wednesday. If you truly care about working families, then you should 
be in favor of advancing the NLRB nominees. The NLRB is essential for 
protecting workers' rights so employees can speak up for better pay, 
stronger protections, and the right to organize without retaliation.
  If we are worried about income inequality and too much of a gap 
between working people and those who are very, very wealthy, the NLRB 
is a great, great way to deal with that problem because, again, it 
strengthens the worker's hand.
  So anyone who says they stand with working Americans should care 
immensely about getting these NLRB nominees done.

                     Tribute to Benjamin L. Cardin

  Mr. President, finally, saying goodbye to Senator Ben Cardin. Today, 
one of the most beloved Members of our caucus and this Chamber, and a 
very near and dear friend of mine, will deliver his farewell address on 
the floor: Senator Cardin. Everyone knows Ben. He is humble and modest, 
and I expect his speech will reflect that. But make no mistake about 
it. Ben's legacy is giant, and he has left an indelible mark on this 
institution, on his home State of Maryland, and on America.
  Now, it is no surprise that Ben and I became so close--and, frankly, 
our wives, Iris and Myrna, have become very close friends--because we 
are cut from the same cloth. We both began our careers in the State 
assembly before coming to Congress.
  Ben, I believe, stayed--he was elected when he was 23 years old, as I 
was, to the assembly. And we both have strong Jewish values. We are 
both known for showing up to any event, big or small. We both married 
up. And another thing, we took great inspiration from our fathers.
  When Ben was just 23 years old and a newly elected member of the 
Maryland House of Delegates, his father told him something that Ben 
still draws upon to this day:

       He had something people worked for a lifetime for . . . the 
     opportunity to make a difference.

  Ben has made an immense difference in Maryland, whether you are 
enjoying the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay, which Ben has 
fought so ardently to restore, protect, and conserve; or riding the 
many roads and bridges and trails and rails across Maryland that Ben 
helped secure billions in Federal funding for; or talking to the 
millions of Marylanders who today have access to better health and 
dental care and the promise of a secure retirement because of Ben's 
efforts. Ben has been a difference maker.
  As chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has made a huge 
difference on human rights and foreign policy. When I asked Ben last 
year to serve as chair, I knew he would be up to the task, and he sure 
was. Despite the many challenges facing America at home and abroad, Ben 
is one of the reasons that America has the power today to hold 
accountable the gross violators

[[Page S6893]]

of human rights, even when their home countries fail to act.
  He worked closely with Senator John McCain on this and the Magnitsky 
Act, and so many ramifications of what was done to Magnitsky inspired 
Ben, and he moved forward on legislation in that regard.
  As chair of Small Business, he made a difference for Main Street 
businesses, especially in the pandemic. I worked closely with Ben to 
make sure small businesses would get the money that they needed. 
Because of his leadership, the small business economy--and we worked 
together to get nonprofits, when I said our churches and our synagogues 
and our mosques and our theaters and our museums needed help as well, 
Ben joined me, and they were saved.
  And he made a difference on many other issues, coleading legislation 
to affirm the ratification of the ERA, the Equal Rights Amendment; 
serving as cochair of the Helsinki Commission; and more.
  The reason Ben was able to accomplish so much was because he took the 
road less traveled here in Congress, oftentimes. He put substance over 
flash. He delved deeply into issues, got to their roots, and then 
worked across the aisle.
  He was all about details: What was the problem? Who was it affecting? 
Who can I find common ground with? Those are questions he asked.
  That has been him from his first day in office, and it will be him 
until his last--smart, decent, humble, loyal, hard-working; a great 
man, a great Senator, and a great friend.
  We will miss him deeply. But Iris and I continue every year--Myrna 
and Ben would come up to New York, and we would go to see Shakespeare 
in the Park. We did it for the last 10 years or so. Ben and Myrna, that 
tradition will continue, as will our friendship, but we will miss you.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                           Federal Judiciary

  Mr. President, on another matter, regarding the Federal judiciary, 
its membership, its independence, and its ethics, I have often found 
myself at increasingly stark odds with many of my Democratic 
colleagues. It is unfortunate, but I don't intend to stop policing the 
separation of powers any sooner than the left stops trying to undermine 
it.
  But over the last year, one corner of the judiciary's operation where 
the Senate rightly holds sway has become the site of rare bipartisan 
agreement, and that is Federal courts' capacity to hear and decide 
cases in a timely manner.
  Across the country, Federal district courts' case backlogs are 
preventing them from rendering swift justice. This past spring, the 
judiciary's own data recorded a 1-year uptick in civil filings before 
district courts of 22 percent.
  The solution to this clear challenge--more district judgeships--has 
earned wide support. In April, the senior Senator from Indiana 
introduced legislation that would steadily apportion larger benches to 
districts across the country over the next decade.
  In August, the JUDGES Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent, 
proving that the right to a speedy trial still enjoys overwhelming 
popularity. I was particularly encouraged by the vocal endorsement of 
my friend the Democratic leader, who recognized the measure as a ``very 
responsible, bipartisan, and prudent bill'' that would lead to ``a 
better functioning judiciary.'' Soon, we expect to House to take up and 
pass the JUDGES Act with similar overwhelming support.
  Normally, we could rest assured that such popular action would be 
signed into law without further ado, but maybe not this time. Last 
week, the White House seemed to suggest, through anonymous comment, 
that President Biden had concerns with the bill. I, for one, would be 
curious to hear the President's rationale. It is hard to imagine a 
justification for blocking the JUDGES Act that doesn't smack of naked 
partisanship. It is almost inconceivable that a lameduck President 
would consider vetoing such an obviously prudential step for any reason 
other than selfish spite.
  Litigants across America deserve their day in court, and they deserve 
to know the Federal judiciary has the bandwidth to carefully and 
thoroughly consider their cases. The President--a former chairman of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee--is well-equipped to appreciate this 
fact, and I hope he acts accordingly.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                                  NLRB

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on January 20, 2021, President Biden 
broke with longstanding precedent and fired the general counsel of the 
National Labor Relations Board. I guess if you campaign on establishing 
``the most pro-union administration in American history,'' then 
replacing duly appointed officials with Big Labor acolytes is certainly 
a day one priority. As we know, this was an area where the President 
really did do his level best to make good on his campaign promises.
  Setting aside his Acting Secretary of Labor's record presiding over 
perhaps the biggest state UI fraud in American history, President 
Biden's NLRB has worked overtime to pollute employer-employee relations 
across the country with vague new standards, distort longstanding free 
speech principles, and wage all-out war on small business franchisers.
  The NLRB member who has held primary responsibility for executing on 
the Biden Big Labor agenda is its Chair, Lauren McFerran, and she is up 
for confirmation to another term.
  If the Board's public actions over the last 4 years are not telling 
enough, I would urge our colleagues to consider the gross mismanagement 
on Ms. McFerran's watch that took an independent inspector general 
report to uncover--serious violations of electoral procedures and 
coverup attempts, to boot. This is to say nothing of the fact that her 
confirmation would give a lameduck President control of an independent 
Board well into his successor's term.
  In this case, there are any number of reasons not to reward bad 
behavior, and whichever our colleagues choose, I hope they will join me 
in opposing the McFerran nomination tomorrow.

                            Border Security

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 10 million. Between official U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection encounters and known ``got-aways,'' there have 
been roughly 10 million migrant encounters at our southern border 
during the Biden-Harris administration.
  To put that number in perspective, that is roughly 10 times the 
population of my home State of South Dakota. Ten million is larger than 
the population of Colorado. It is larger than the population of 
Tennessee. It is larger than the population of Maryland, of 
Massachusetts, of Indiana. I could keep going. Ten million is larger 
than the population of the vast majority of U.S. States.
  Needless to say, a crisis of this size has had consequences. Shelters 
have been overwhelmed. Border cities have been overwhelmed. Blue cities 
far from the border have been overwhelmed. Border Patrol agents are 
exhausted, as their Chief noted in an interview last week.
  I haven't even mentioned the national security implications. There is 
no question that the chaos at our southern border represents a serious 
security risk for our country. And you don't have to take my word for 
it. The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 threat assessment notes:

       Over the next year, we expect some individuals with 
     terrorism ties and some criminal actors will continue their 
     efforts to exploit migration flows and the complex border 
     security environment to enter the United States.

  That is from the Biden Department of Homeland Security's 2025 threat 
assessment.

[[Page S6894]]

  The June arrest of 8 Tajikistan nationals with suspected ties to ISIS 
who had illegally entered the country as well as the identification of 
more than 400 migrants who used an ISIS-affiliated smuggling network to 
enter the United States are just two examples of the kinds of threats 
we face.
  Then there is the fact that chaos at the border creates opportunities 
for cross-border illegal activity, like the deadly trade in fentanyl, 
which affects communities around our country. My State of South Dakota 
is about as far away from the southern border as you can get, but law 
enforcement officials consistently tell me that the illegal drugs they 
are dealing with have entered the country across our southern border.
  Four years of recordbreaking illegal immigration at our southern 
border under the Biden-Harris administration. Ten million encounters--
and those are the migrants that we know of. It has been a dangerous 4 
years, but the end is in sight. When President Trump and Republicans 
take control in January, stemming the flood of illegal immigration will 
be one of our first priorities. Under Republicans, national security 
here at home, at our borders and in our communities, will be just as 
important as taking care of our national security priorities abroad.
  We are going to start right away with a once-in-a-generation 
investment in border security and immigration enforcement here in 
Congress. Among other things, that package will include substantial 
resources to increase the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
officers and Border Patrol agents, increase detention space, and 
provide the barriers and technology we need to fully secure the border.
  There is a lot of work to do and a big mess to clean up.
  A recent article reported that there are around 1.4 million 
individuals who have been ordered to be deported but are still here in 
the United States, and most of them are not in immigration custody. And 
that is just one small corner of the problem.
  As I said, we have a lot of work to do, but Republicans are 
committed, for the sake of our national security and for the sake of 
our rule of law. Four years of recordbreaking illegal immigration, but 
the end is in sight.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

                                 China

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Joseph Stalin was rumored to have once 
said:

       We will hang the capitalists with the rope they sell us.

  Unfortunately, the United States has been selling the Chinese 
Communist Party a lot of rope in recent years. At this very moment, 
American entities are fueling China's aggression by funneling huge 
amounts of capital into capabilities that could eventually be used 
against the United States and our allies. From advanced semiconductors 
to quantum computing to artificial intelligence it is high time that 
the United States becomes serious about limiting the flow of U.S. 
dollars into the arsenal of our biggest strategic adversary.
  By some estimates, U.S. investments in Chinese communities totaled 
more than $2.3 trillion in market value in 2020. That is American 
investments in Chinese companies--$2.3 trillion in market value at the 
end of 2020. That includes $21 billion in semiconductors, $54 billion 
in military companies, and a whopping $221 billion in artificial 
intelligence. According to a report from the U.S.-China Economic and 
Security Review Commission, ``The United States is the most important 
foreign source of investment to semiconductors, quantum computing, and 
AI in China.''
  Because of China's strategy of military-civil fusion, these 
investments are not simply benefiting China's economy; they are 
directly bolstering China's military. China is the greatest national 
security threat of our time. I think we all understand that, and it is 
incomprehensible to me that American investors are continuing to 
bankroll its rise, and we are essentially blind to what that scale and 
what the focus of those investments really are.
  The Chinese Communist Party has become increasingly aggressive in its 
efforts to gain power and influence, embracing illicit tactics like 
intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and predatory 
lending. According to findings of the House Select Committee on 
Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese 
Communist Party, China subsidizes the sale of fentanyl and illicit 
narcotics abroad and has fueled addiction and death in the United 
States. The Drug Enforcement Administration reports that fentanyl is 
the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 18 and 
45. We know where the precursors are coming from. We know where they 
go--to Mexico--and then they are combined and then produced to look 
like normal pharmaceutical drugs, much to the chagrin and misery and 
death of so many of our young people. And then, 2 years ago, the United 
States intercepted a surveillance balloon from China that crossed 
across our country.
  Meanwhile the Chinese Communist Party continues to assert excessive 
and illegal maritime boundary claims in the South China Sea, at times 
using force against our treaty ally, the Philippines, when they have 
attempted to resupply their ship near the Second Thomas Shoal. 
President Xi has ordered the Chinese military to be ready and capable 
of taking Taiwan by force in 2027--just 2 years from now.
  So it should go without saying that the United States should exercise 
caution before continuing to sell the Chinese Communist Party rope in 
the form of sensitive technology, like advanced semiconductors and 
artificial intelligence.
  I have been working with my colleagues here to address legislation 
that would provide some transparency for this outbound investment from 
the United States to the PRC. Last year, the Senate made good progress 
on this issue by including a provision to address outbound investment 
transparency in the Senate-passed National Defense Authorization Act. 
The Senate voted 91 to 6 to include my amendment in the NDAA last year, 
showing an overwhelming bipartisan consensus on the need to address 
this issue. We all know how hard it is to find consensus around here. A 
60-vote threshold can be hard to come by on many important issues, but 
upward of 90 votes should send a clear message that this issue is one 
that we deem of utmost importance on a bipartisan basis. We all are 
acutely aware of our competition with China and our need to counter 
some of China's aggression, and including prohibitions on certain 
outbound investments is a critical step to that end.
  I must say we have had some great partners in the House. I want to 
thank, in particular,   John Moolenaar, chair of the Select Committee 
on the Chinese Communist Party; Congressman   Michael McCaul, chair of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House; and Speaker of the House of 
Representatives   Mike Johnson, who have all contributed to our efforts 
to advance this issue, but this isn't where the story ends.
  The Senate has--or had--another opportunity to include these 
provisions in the Defense Authorization Act this year, but House 
minority leader Hakeem Jeffries chose to block these provisions. One 
person is standing in the way. It is simply unconscionable that anyone 
who claims to care about the China threat would be opposed to outbound 
investment transparency, and it is unacceptable to play political games 
with such an essential national security provision.
  I understand, over the last day, Leader Jeffries has listened to the 
voice of reason and come back to the negotiating table. And I am 
hopeful that these conversations will continue to be productive and 
yield a positive outcome. The national security of our country depends 
on it, and we must not squander this opportunity to confront the 
Chinese Communist Party. Time is running out.

  We all know that we are living in the most dangerous time since World 
War II. Our adversaries are not shy about the fact that they are 
working together. Earlier this year, China and Russia pledged to deepen 
their trust and cooperation, while they have continued to conduct joint 
military exercises. North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to Russia, and 
some intelligence estimates suggest they may be willing

[[Page S6895]]

to provide up to 100,000 soldiers in the coming months, from North 
Korea to Russia, to fight in Ukraine.
  Meanwhile, Iran and its proxies have been attacking U.S. shipments in 
the Red Sea and have launched a terrorist attack against our greatest 
strategic ally in the Middle East, which is Israel. It is no secret--it 
is well-known--that China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are working in 
concert to undermine American interests and to threaten the stability 
of the global world order. So we should not add our name to the list by 
helping them with the gift of unrestrained, nontransparent American 
investment.
  I would urge all of our colleagues to not let politics stand in the 
way of our national security. We cannot stand by and continue selling 
the communists in China the rope they will use to hang the United 
States of America.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.
  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 
10 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act

  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, we are come to the end now of 2024, to the 
end of another legislative session--indeed, to the end of another 
Congress. And before this Congress congratulates itself on finishing 
its legislative work next week, I must come again here to this floor 
and remind my colleagues that hundreds of thousands of good Americans 
are still waiting for this Congress to act, waiting for justice to be 
done in their cases.
  I am talking about the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have 
been poisoned by nuclear radiation by their own government. I am 
talking about the people of St. Louis, MO, an original uranium 
processing site dating back to the Manhattan Project 50, 60 years ago 
now.
  The people of St. Louis did their duty proudly, patriotically; but 
the government didn't do right by them. What did the government do when 
the Manhattan Project was shut down? The government took that nuclear 
waste, that radioactive material, and dumped it into a public landfill. 
They allowed it to seep into our groundwater. They allowed it to be 
distributed across the region so that now, in the greater St. Louis 
area and the greater St. Charles area, thousands upon thousands of 
Missourians have been exposed to nuclear waste and radiation for 
decades.
  And even as I stand here today, the radiation continues. The 
groundwater is still in doubt. Coldwater Creek is still contaminated. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Army Corps of Engineers discovered additional 
nuclear radioactive material under residents' homes in suburban St. 
Louis. Weldon Spring is still not fully remediated. And no one--I 
emphasize ``no one''--in the State of Missouri has received a dime in 
compensation from the Federal Government for the decades of radioactive 
exposure that this government forced upon them.
  And the people of Missouri are not alone. The same story is repeated 
over and over in places like New Mexico and Arizona and in Idaho and in 
Colorado and in Wyoming and Montana--and I could go on--hundreds of 
thousands of Americans, exposed through no fault of their own, many of 
them veterans, I might add, many of them miners who went to work in 
uranium mines to provide the critical material that allowed us to 
support our nuclear program, that allowed us to win both the Second 
World War and the Cold War.
  And what has the U.S. Government done for these good Americans--
veterans, laymen, one and all? What has the government done for them? 
Nothing. It has exposed them to nuclear radiation and done nothing.
  That is why this body finally acted this year, passing with a huge 
bipartisan majority legislation that would finally compensate and honor 
those Americans who served their country, who gave their health and in 
many cases, yes, gave their lives for this country's national security 
as part of our nuclear program.

  Mr. President, while this body has acted, the House has not. And here 
we are now, at the end of this calendar year, at the end of this 
legislative session; and because the House has waited and because the 
House has stalled and because the House has failed to act, the 
Radiation Exposure Compensation Program has now fully expired--fully 
expired--so that no American, no veteran, no one across the country who 
has been exposed by the government to this radioactive waste--not a 
single person has been compensated for the cancers that they have 
contracted, compensated for the loved ones whom they have lost to 
radioactive-related diseases--nobody. It is completely dark. No one is 
getting anything.
  And now we are told, Mr. President, that at this eleventh hour, after 
this body has passed legislation, not once but twice, to fairly 
compensate these good Americans, after this body has acted to ensure 
that these good Americans get the justice that they deserve, now, at 
this eleventh hour, after the House has allowed the program to expire, 
we are told that now House leadership is considering a backroom deal, a 
backroom deal to be shoved into an end-of-the-year package next week 
that would select just a few counties in one State, the State of Utah--
just a few counties to compensate and exclude everybody else. I cannot 
emphasize to the Presiding Officer enough what an offense this would 
be.
  For months now, victims have met with House leadership and negotiated 
with them a path forward. I have negotiated with House leadership. Many 
here have engaged in this effort to find a way to get the House to act 
and compensate these good Americans who have been poisoned. And now, at 
this last minute, for House leadership to be preparing, as reports 
indicate they are, to shove down the throats of these victims across 
the country a backroom deal that excludes almost all of them--almost 
all of them--is not only unacceptable, but it is absolutely offensive. 
It is unjust. It is wrong.
  President Reagan used to say that sometimes there really are simple 
answers, just not easy ones. Let's be direct about this. What House 
leadership is considering here, there is a simple way to describe it: 
It is wrong. It is just flat out wrong. There is no more nuance needed 
than that.
  And who will suffer if House leadership puts up a backroom deal, 
rigged for only a few insiders, excluding most of the country? Who will 
suffer? I will tell you who will suffer. It will be people like the 
young children of Jana Elementary in my home State of Missouri, an 
elementary school that had to close over a year ago because of 
continuing radioactive contamination right there in the St. Louis area. 
This elementary school is right near the creek that is still 
contaminated. The entire school had to shut down. Who knows how many 
children had been exposed, by the way, before that happened. The entire 
school closed. It is still closed. It will remain closed, and every 
child will remain uncompensated and exposed until the House chooses to 
act.
  Think about Leslie Begay, a member of the Navajo Nation. No one 
contributed more to the defense of this country than the proud members 
of the Navajo Nation. In the Second World War, in the Cold War, and 
still today, their rates of volunteer service for our military are 
higher than any other community in the entire country. And nobody 
suffered more from the fallout of the nuclear program than the Navajo 
Nation, including Leslie, who has had a double lung transplant.
  If the House fails to act, if the House forces a backroom deal 
through this body, Leslie and thousands of others like him will be 
uncompensated, will be unhonored, will be unrecognized. It is wrong, 
Mr. President.
  Consider Claire, a young girl from Missouri, diagnosed with a 
radiation-related illness when she was born, going through chemotherapy 
when she was just a child, age 2.
  Consider Bernice Gutierrez, from the great State of New Mexico. Every 
member of Bernice's family for three generations now has had cancer and 
multiple radiation-related illnesses because they were downwind of the 
original Oppenheimer tests that carried that radioactive nuclear cloud 
over so much of our country.
  Consider Zach Visintine from the State of Missouri: born with cancer, 
died at the age of 2. He never had a chance. Why? Well, because his 
mother grew up along Coldwater Creek in the St. Louis region of 
Missouri that is still, to this day, contaminated.

[[Page S6896]]

  None of these people--none of them--have been helped by their 
government with the expenses, with the losses, with the pain that the 
government forced on them--not a one of them.
  Mr. President, it is time to act, and I want to be crystal clear 
about this. If the House persists, if House leadership persists and 
attempts to force into a CR package a partial, backroom, special-
interest deal that excludes these good people, I will object; and if 
they come to this body asking for a time agreement at the end of the 
session to pass that package, I will object.
  I want to be clear about this. There is no way forward for a partial, 
backroom deal--no way. I will stand in the way, on behalf of every one 
of these Americans, as long as it takes, until justice is done. This is 
the time. This body has acted, and I call on the House to act. What we 
should do instead of their backroom deal is pass what this body has 
already passed: generous compensation--fair, just compensation, with a 
spending limit, that will fairly honor, recognize, and help these good 
Americans who deserve it. This isn't a handout; this is justice. This 
is recognition of what these good Americans have done and what they 
have suffered.
  You know, we are near upon Christmas now, and it is sort of old-
fashioned, but it used to be around Christmastime sometimes we would 
talk about the Christmas feeling or the Christian feeling. Well, I 
would just observe this: What does that Christian feeling consist of if 
not, in the words of Micah, ``doing justice, loving kindness, and 
walking humbly with our God''? This is a chance, I might just say, to 
do just that: to do justice, to show kindness, to fulfill our duty to 
our fellow Americans.
  The Scripture admonishes us to be not just hearers but doers as well. 
As this year comes to a close, let's be doers of justice. Let's be 
demonstrators of kindness. Let's do what is right by our fellow 
Americans. Let's honor our countrymen for what they have done. Let's 
right this wrong finally, this 50-year wrong. Let's right it. Let's end 
the year and end the Congress with this historic righting of a wrong, 
and then we can say to our constituents and to our fellow Americans 
``Merry Christmas.'' Then we can say we have truly done our jobs here.
  Until that time, Mr. President, I will be here, I will be standing, 
and I will be advocating on their behalf.
  I yield the floor.

                      Nomination of Keli M. Neary

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Keli Marie Neary to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of 
Pennsylvania. She is an accomplished litigator who has devoted her 
entire legal career to public service in the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.
  After receiving her undergraduate degree from the University of 
Pittsburgh at Johnstown and her law degree from Widener University 
Commonwealth Law School, Ms. Neary clerked on the 41st Judicial 
District of Pennsylvania for Perry and Juniata Counties.
  Following her clerkship, Ms. Neary served as an assistant counsel in 
the Governor's Office of General Counsel, assigned to the Pennsylvania 
State Police's Office of Chief Counsel. She specialized in enforcement 
of the Gaming Act, personnel litigation, contract interpretation, and 
firearms-related due process hearings.
  Since 2012, Ms. Neary has worked at the Pennsylvania Office of 
Attorney General (OAG), currently serving as the executive deputy 
attorney general for the civil law division. At the OAG, she represents 
and defends a broad array of different government agencies, officials, 
and employees in matters before State and Federal courts and defends 
constitutional challenges to Pennsylvania statutes and regulations.
  Over the course of her career, Ms. Neary has tried 13 cases to 
verdict. She has also participated in the briefing of hundreds of trial 
and appellate matters in State and Federal courts and argued numerous 
motions and injunctions.
  Ms. Neary has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr. 
Casey and Mr. Fetterman. In addition, she was unanimously rated 
``qualified'' by the American Bar Association.

                         Farewell to the Senate

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say good-bye, 
as difficult as this may be.
  Marylanders have trusted me to represent them for 20 years in the 
Maryland General Assembly, 8 years as speaker of the house, 20 years in 
the House of Representatives, and 18 years in the U.S. Senate, 
including now chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
  Let me start by thanking Marylanders for giving me your trust to 
represent you in this august body. You have supported me in 18 
elections. The Hebrew letter for 18 is chai, which also means life--58 
years of my life.
  My grandparents came to this country over 100 years ago to escape the 
pogroms of Europe, and they settled in

[[Page S6897]]

Baltimore and built a life for their family. Their grandson now serves 
in the U.S. Senate. This is a great country.
  Marylanders have allowed me to pursue my ambition of public service, 
to help others whose voices and needs are often ignored in the halls of 
power. In my family, I was taught from a young age that it is our 
responsibility to make the world a better place--tikkun olam, repair 
the world--and help those who are less fortunate and are in need--
tzedakah, charity.
  These principles were demonstrated to me by the communal activities 
of my parents. These principles--these values--have been my North Star 
that has guided my public service as a legislator. Of course, the work 
of a legislator is not always easy. It requires perseverance, patience, 
a sense of humor, and optimism that we can make the world a better 
place, even in the face of often horrible, seemingly insurmountable 
challenges.
  But as I look back at my time here, it is the hardest battles that 
were some of the most rewarding. Each one reflects the values I cherish 
and the collective will to help make the world around us and our 
communities a better place to live.
  On the Senate Finance Committee, I have had a front seat advancing 
health policy. I was fortunate to serve with the champion of 
healthcare, Senator Ted Kennedy. He was a mentor to me as to steps we 
can take so that all Americans have access to affordable, quality 
healthcare.
  Healthcare should be a right for everyone in this country and not a 
privilege only for those who can afford it.
  I was proud to be part of the Congress that passed the Affordable 
Care Act. That law included my legislation that elevated the National 
Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities at NIH. As much 
progress as this has brought, the struggle for healthcare equality 
continues.
  Today, Medicare coverage includes legislation I authored for 
screening and preventive care, saving lives and dollars. And all health 
insurance now covers pediatric dental care, which was legislation I 
authored after the tragic death of Demonte Driver, a 12-year-old in 
Maryland whose life could have been saved with a simple tooth 
extraction.
  I partnered with Senator Rob Portman in both the House and in the 
Senate to expand retirement security, particularly for lower wage 
workers. Thanks to legislation we coauthored that has been enacted into 
law, more employers are providing opportunities for their employees to 
participate in retirement plans. Our legislation included a saver's 
credit for lower wage workers and automatic enrollment provisions that 
have dramatically increased participation by employees. In the last 10 
years, participation in retirement savings for the lowest income 
quintile of Americans has increased by 135 percent.
  In affordable housing and economic development in underserved 
communities, I have worked with Senator Cantwell on improvements to the 
low-income housing tax credit. I have authored successful legislation 
to expand the new markets tax credits and historic tax credits, which 
have been used for economic development and affordable housing 
opportunities across Maryland and our Nation.
  Examples of the use of these tools in Maryland include the Justice 
Thurgood Marshall Center in Baltimore, the Natty Boh building in 
Baltimore, and the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center in Annapolis. And, yes, 
just yesterday, Senator Van Hollen and I were at the Southern Stream 
Health and Wellness Center, which used new markets tax credits with 
Bishop Hickman, which is energizing and revitalizing communities in 
East Baltimore.
  On the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had the 
opportunity to expand the Federal Government's commitment to our 
infrastructure. The recently enacted bipartisan infrastructure law 
included many of my priorities. For example, it included funding for 
reconnecting communities that had been divided and disadvantaged 
through ill-conceived transportation projects. The poster child for 
this initiative is the Franklin-Mulberry corridor in Baltimore. It was 
not surprising that Baltimore received funding in the first round of 
Federal grants.
  I am equally proud of the expansion of the Transportation 
Alternatives Program, or TAP. I was the author of the TAP program, 
which allows governments to make their own priority decisions on the 
use of part of the Federal highway funds. That has been a favorite 
source of funds to provide trails for local communities that connect 
neighborhoods for walkers and bikers, including, for example, the 
rehabilitation of the C&O Towpath in Washington, Frederick, and 
Montgomery Counties.
  Myrna and I take advantage of these paths to absorb the beauty of our 
communities that are now connected through paths and trails.
  Older communities still have lead pipes bringing drinking water into 
their homes and schools, threatening the health of our children. The 
bipartisan infrastructure law provides significant help to eliminate 
this public health threat, including $82 million in Federal grants for 
Maryland. It also provides unprecedented increases in transit funding, 
a priority of mine which is particularly important to traditionally 
underserved and underrepresented communities.
  This law allows Maryland to move forward again with the transit Red 
Line in Baltimore. Funding for Amtrak enabled Baltimore to begin 
construction of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel to expedite travel along 
the Northeast corridor.
  One of my top priorities as a Maryland Senator has been to promote 
the health of the Chesapeake Bay, and the Federal partnership has been 
essential in this cause. The bay is a national treasure, the largest 
estuary in our hemisphere and iconic to Maryland. It is in our DNA, 
particularly important to our economy and our way of life.
  I first started fighting for the bay in the Maryland General 
Assembly. When I was speaker of the house, I partnered with Governor 
Harry Hughes to establish the multi-State effort to save the bay. It 
led to the partnership with six States and the District of Columbia and 
the Federal Bay Program.

  Maryland Senators have taken the Federal lead, starting with Senator 
Mac Matthias, then Senators Paul Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski, and now 
Senator Chris Van Hollen and myself.
  During my years in the Senate, I have worked with my colleagues to 
increase funds for the bay, including the EPA, NOAA, the Army Corps of 
Engineers, wastewater treatment funds, watershed grant funds, 
agriculture land preservation funds, oyster restoration funds, removal 
of invasive species--from the nutria to the blue catfish--and many, 
many more.
  I particularly want to note with pride funding for Poplar Island and 
Mid-Bay--location for dredging disposals--that have been used for 
environmental restoration and a noncontroversial location necessary to 
keep our channels commercially competitive.
  Our work on the Chesapeake Bay is working and has become a global 
model of multijurisdictional cooperation.
  The Environment and Public Works Committee helps each region of our 
country that suffers from a catastrophic event that destroys 
infrastructure. I thank the leadership of the committee for reaching 
out to Maryland after the tragic loss of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. 
The Biden administration has been there every step of the way to help 
Maryland, and I am confident that Congress will provide the resources 
and authority to move forward on the construction of the new bridge as 
quickly as possible.
  I have been both a chair and ranking member on the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee. I am so proud of the bipartisan work of the 
committee, working with Senator Rubio, particularly during COVID. The 
historic relief packages we designed not only saved many small 
businesses but truly helped to save our economy during the pandemic.
  I am particularly proud of the focus I brought to help traditionally 
underserved communities. Senator Warner and I worked to provide support 
for the CDFIs so financing options were available in underbanked 
communities. Including nonprofits and returning citizens to the program 
once again provided help and services in often forgotten neighborhoods.
  During my chairmanship, Maryland expanded from one to four women's 
business centers. Two are located at

[[Page S6898]]

HBCUs. In addition, Maryland opened its first Veterans Business 
Outreach Center. Because of these programs, small businesses are 
thriving in Maryland, especially those led by women and, particularly, 
women of color.
  My service in Congress built on my record of inclusion started with 
my service in the Maryland General Assembly. As a Baltimore City 
legislator, I fought for equalization in State educational funds to 
favor poorer property wealth jurisdictions, such as Baltimore City. I 
helped develop the Maryland hospital all-payer rate system for equal 
healthcare access regardless of economic circumstances. Under this 
system, Maryland has avoided having charity hospitals. As a Member of 
the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, I have helped 
preserve and strengthen the Maryland hospital rate system.
  I was the leader in the State of Maryland for the development of the 
Circuit Breaker Property Tax Credit Program, which allows seniors to 
remain in their homes.
  And as speaker of the house, I appointed the first woman and the 
first African American to chair a standing committee.
  One of my proudest accomplishments as a legislator came in the U.S. 
Senate. It was the passage and enactment of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule 
of Law Accountability Act. This law was inspired by the death of Sergei 
Magnitsky, a Russian tax attorney who was murdered, 15 years ago last 
month, for uncovering corruption. His story has been told to the world 
by his client Bill Browder and came to my attention as the chair of the 
Helsinki Commission.
  When I was first elected to Congress in 1987, my family was deeply 
involved in the cause of getting Soviet Jews out of the Soviet Union. 
My wife Myrna was a leader of the Maryland Committee for Soviet Jewry. 
My close friend, Representative Steny Hoyer, chaired the U.S. Helsinki 
Commission that took up the cause of Soviet Jews and gave me the 
opportunity to become involved. Steny and I traveled together to 
several countries behind the Iron Curtain to give hope to those who 
were living in countries where their leaders denied their citizens 
basic human rights.
  So when Sergei Magnitsky was killed, it was clear to me that those 
who violated his basic rights needed to be held accountable, even if 
the Russian Government refused to act. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
Accountability Act targeted those individuals who were complicit in his 
jailing and murder. It blocked these individuals from enjoying the 
benefits of America, from traveling to our country and using our 
banking system. It put their reputation, ability to travel, and access 
to their assets at risk.
  These policies were influenced by Senator Scoop Jackson's 
legislation, the Jackson-Vanik Law, that denied trade privileges to 
countries that blocked their citizens from emigrating. When Jackson-
Vanik was repealed because its purpose had been accomplished, it was 
appropriate that that legislation was used as the vehicle to replace 
Jackson-Vanik with Magnitsky.
  The original Magnitsky Law focused on human rights abuses in Russia, 
and, in 2016, I authored the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act, which expanded the legislation around the world.
  These laws have given birth to a whole new international legal 
framework for upholding human rights and deterring corrupt actors. The 
European Union and other governments around the world have replicated 
the Magnitsky system. As of this year, the U.S. program has sanctioned 
more than 650 foreign persons and entities.
  But I have to underline a really important point. These laws were not 
easy to pass. The pushback from Russia alone was historic and continues 
to this day. But it was the bipartisan support that allowed these bills 
to make it through the process. I want to acknowledge Senators Dick 
Lugar, John McCain, and Roger Wicker, my partners in getting the 
Magnitsky Laws enacted. As a result, they have not only been enacted, 
but they have been very effective.
  Despite setbacks and opposition, we never gave up hope, and, today, 
corrupt leaders fear the Magnitsky sanctions. The safety of human 
rights defenders has benefited from these laws.
  Over and over again, in my work as a legislator, I have seen the 
importance of never giving up. Across my years in Congress, I have seen 
what I thought would be a dream come true. I have seen the Soviet Jews 
liberated from the former Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall torn down, 
former communist-controlled countries now NATO allies, and political 
prisoners released to freedom. It is great to see my friend Vladimir 
Kara-Murza free from being imprisoned in Russia.

  As Vaclav Havel, the reform leader of the Czech Republic, said, 
``There is only one thing I will not concede: that it might be 
meaningless to strive in a good cause.'' Each of us can make a 
difference. Never give up hope.
  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``Everybody can be great, because 
everybody can serve.''
  As my friend and classmate in the House of Representatives--along 
with my classmate Kweisi Mfume--Representative John Lewis, said, we 
should all be willing to get into ``good trouble.''
  As that famous philosopher from Baltimore, Babe Ruth, stated, ``Never 
let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.''
  I often speak about the need for a value-based approach to 
policymaking. This has rung true in healthcare and the environment, 
promoting a dignified retirement, creating economic opportunities for 
all. Perhaps nowhere has this been more fundamental than when it comes 
to foreign policy and national security.
  President Biden got it right when he spoke about our international 
engagement. He said:

       We must start with diplomacy rooted in America's most 
     [cherished] democratic values: defending freedom, championing 
     opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule 
     of law, and treating every person with dignity.

  As chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I made promoting 
value-based foreign policy decisions a top priority. In addition to the 
Magnitsky Act, I am especially proud of my work with Todd Young on the 
Combating Global Corruption Act that was enacted in 2023. That 
legislation requires each of our Embassies around the world to evaluate 
how effective the country in which our Embassy is located is in 
fighting corruption. The model used for this legislation is similar to 
the trafficking in persons tier rankings and reports, with consequences 
against countries that are not making acceptable progress to improve 
their rankings against human trafficking.
  Leading globally against human trafficking and corruption is 
America's value-based foreign policy at its finest. America's strength 
is in our values. We need to lead globally with our strength.
  My ability to promote legislation and policies that uphold core 
universal values was made possible because of my incredible partners, 
because of their deep values and commitment. There is no way I could 
have achieved what I have been able to achieve if it weren't for my 
incredible staff. Their loyalty, their dedication to public service, 
and their talent made the Cardin Team.
  In 38 years in Congress, I have only had two chiefs--Dave Koshgarian 
and Chris Lynch. Both led by example and recruited the very best to 
public service.
  For over 25 years, Debbie Yamada has attempted to manage the 
impossible--me.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a complete list of the staff I have been blessed to have during my 
terms in the U.S. Senate.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record as follows:

  Mr. CARDIN. Our staff works long hours for less compensation than 
many of them could make in the private sector because of their 
commitment to public service.
  To my staff, you have made Team Cardin a championship team.
  I also want to salute the people who make this institution work. My 
heartfelt thanks to the floor staff, committee staffs, security staff, 
and all those who work behind the scenes to make the Senate work. I 
recognize and salute your dedication.
  As I said at the beginning, I don't want to say goodbye. This is 
especially true of my colleagues, my Senate family--and you are family. 
These past 18 years have been the honor of my life. You have my undying 
gratitude for partnering with me to serve our country.
  I started in the Senate in 2007 with a class of 10 new Senators. 
Senators Webb, McCaskill, and Corker are no longer in the Senate. I 
regret that Senators Tester, Brown, and Casey will be leaving with me 
at the end of this term. To the remaining three--Senators Klobuchar, 
Sanders, and Whitehouse--we count on you to carry on our class 
traditions.
  I was blessed to have two seat mates during my 18 years in the Senate 
who are trusted friends. Senator Barbara Mikulski welcomed me to the 
Senate and made my transition so productive. Senator Chris Van Hollen 
and I have worked in unity for the people of Maryland. I know that he 
will continue to serve the people well as the senior Senator along with 
newly elected Angela Alsobrooks.
  But the partners that made public service possible for me are my 
family. Myrna and I met in elementary school. Last month, we celebrated 
our 60th wedding anniversary--amazing that she put up with all those 
years. She is my strongest supporter. I could not have had the career 
that I had without her unconditional support and confidence.
  Myrna shares my commitment of giving back to the community, and she 
keeps me properly grounded. When I became speaker of the house, she 
sent me a card to remind me of this. The card read: ``To the rest of 
the world you may be a roaring lion, but in this house, you are just a 
pussycat.''
  (Laughter.)
  I put that card on my desk in Annapolis as a constant reminder.
  My son of blessed memory and my daughter Deborah supported my public 
career, never complaining about the family sacrifices they had to make, 
and I know there were many.
  Finally, some parting advice. I know that many people across this 
country and around the world are concerned about the direction of the 
United States, but I am optimistic we will get through these 
challenges.
  Now, some people might say: Optimistic? How can that be?
  They read the news and say: What about our justice system? What about 
the rule of law? What about our democracy? What about the threat of 
autocracies around the world and here at home? What about the 
resurgence of corrupt, blatantly transactional politics?
  I recognize these threats. I am not naive to the dangers and 
challenges as we all look ahead. There are many challenges ahead of us, 
but we must not give up hope.
  The Senate--this body of 100 Members in a nation of 335 million 
Americans--sustains my hope. In a 6-year term representing constituents 
across the United States, we have the time and resources to engage each 
other. We have the time to constructively work across the aisle to find 
areas of common agreement.
  There is no institution like this in the world. It is a great honor 
to be a Senator, but it comes with responsibilities--to debate and vote 
on important issues of our times.
  Over the last 18 years, I have seen firsthand how the Senate works 
best when we work together. I cited many examples of my successful 
efforts to do just that--working across the aisle to enact pension 
reform, small business COVID relief, advancing value-based foreign 
policy, and many more.
  We don't have to agree on every single issue, and we never will, but 
when we defend the constitutional powers of this institution and the 
prerogatives of the legislative branch together, we create positive 
results for this country. The Senate is where the rubber meets the 
road. It is the dividing line between democracy and autocracy.
  To my colleagues in the Senate, you play an important role in our 
democratic check and balance system. Never has it been more important 
for us to fight to protect our democracy, to defend the rule of law, 
and to stand up for our common values.
  As Senators, you need to demonstrate to the American public by your 
actions that you can practice civility, that differences can be 
resolved constructively without harsh terms. We need to remember that 
compromise was how our Nation was formed. It can be a good thing and 
bring people together.
  Compromise on policy but never on principles or values. Treat people 
with respect even when you disagree. I made that the guiding principle 
in my office. My staff call it Cardinesque.
  Finally, let us all make it a priority to promote better knowledge 
and understanding of history, civic engagement, and, again, civility.
  Whether promoting American values or investing in domestic priorities 
here at home, I ask you to let your values guide you to leave our world 
and our community a fairer place, a healthier place, a more peaceful 
place, a more prosperous place for all to benefit. Let that be our 
North Star.
  I yield the floor.
  (Applause, Senators rising.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.

                     Tribute to Benjamin L. Cardin

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that on behalf 
of the Maryland congressional delegation, I pay tribute to our 
incredible senior Senator and thank him for his service to our State 
and our country and, in fact, all he has done around the world.
  I want to recognize the fact that Steny Hoyer, Congressman Hoyer, is 
with us on the floor as well.
  Thank you, Mr. Leader, for being here.
  For those of you who don't know, when Ben Cardin was speaker of the 
Maryland House, Steny Hoyer was president of the Maryland Senate, so 
they have gone way back together.
  Thank you, Steny, for being here.
  Colleagues, I think all of us here know Ben Cardin for his many, many 
achievements and accomplishments and the fact that he is a wonderful 
colleague to work with. He has gone over some of those major 
highlights, so I am not going to repeat them all, but I do just want to 
flag a number of them, because the Magnitsky Act is the legislation 
that said the United States--it not only says we are going to stand up 
and protect fighters for human rights around the world, but we are 
going to create an enforcement mechanism to do exactly that.
  We had a hearing just the other day in the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee reviewing that legislation. That legislation would not exist 
but for the fact that Ben Cardin made it happen--first through the 
original Sergei Magnitsky Act and then the Global Magnitsky Act--as a 
champion of human rights.
  So this is why Senator Cardin is known not only for his 
accomplishments in Maryland and in the United States but indeed around 
the world, as is true with his service on the Helsinki Commission--his 
partner, of course, Senator Roger Wicker--which has been standing up 
for human rights, fighting against hate and anti-Semitism around the 
world, and doing more here at home. It is a fight against 
discrimination.
  I want to thank him for his global reach but also for all he has done 
here in the United States when it comes to healthcare. He recounted the 
story of a Marylander whose name was Deamonte Driver who died because 
he did not get the dental care he needed. Senator Cardin worked to make 
sure that never happens again.
  Whether it is housing or protecting the Chesapeake Bay or many other 
areas that are so important to our national life, Ben Cardin has been a 
leader.
  In Maryland, we are very proud of all of those achievements, but in 
Maryland, Senator Cardin is known as ``our friend Ben.'' If you look at 
his TV commercials when he runs for reelection, you can find everyday 
people, whether it is a waterman on the Chesapeake Bay, whether it is a 
construction worker near the Port of Baltimore and others, saying: 
Thank you to my friend Ben. And because of his great length and quality 
of service, many people around the State of Maryland have had a chance 
to meet their friend Ben.

  And he began to serve the State of Maryland when he was 22 years old. 
When he ran for the State delegate, he was still a law student at the 
University of Maryland Baltimore; and for 58 consecutive years, he has 
served the people of our State.
  And he didn't just dream of winning elections. That was not the goal; 
that was the means to achieve his efforts in public service. And that 
ethic, as he has said, began in the Cardin family long before he first 
ran for office.
  He is the son of Dora, a school teacher, and Meyer, a State 
legislator and judge. His wife Myrna and his late cousin Shoshana made 
their names as champions for Soviet Jewry. The Cardin family believes 
in America as a beacon of liberty and human rights, a beacon that first 
inspired Ben's grandparents to immigrate here from Russia at the turn 
of the last century.
  So I think it is fair to say that Ben Cardin did not fall far from 
the Cardin tree of public service, but he has taken that family's 
commitment to public service to new heights, becoming, at 35 years old, 
the youngest ever speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates.
  And I want to talk a little bit about his role here in the U.S. 
Senate on behalf of Team Maryland. Because he is a dear friend, there 
are many congressional delegations that don't have the spirit of unity 
that we have had in the State of Maryland, and that is a tribute to Ben 
Cardin's leadership. He has been the quarterback for Team Maryland, 
bringing us together to make sure that we work on behalf of the 
priorities of the people of our State--all parts of our State, from the 
Baltimore area to the Washington suburbs, Eastern Shore, and Western 
Maryland.
  I could not ask for a better partner and a better friend in the U.S. 
Senate, somebody who welcomed me here after I served in the House of 
Representatives.
  I do want to relay briefly to our colleagues in the Democratic caucus 
something that is not as well-known, but when Ben Cardin first arrived 
in the Senate from the House, having served previously as the speaker 
of the house of delegates in Maryland, he was interested in what the 
rules are of the Democratic caucus. It turns out, at the time, that the 
rules were not publicized among the Democratic Members of the caucus. 
Former Democratic leaders clearly viewed it as in their interest to 
keep them secret, to keep the Members of the caucus in the dark.
  And so when Ben Cardin asked for the rules, it took a little search 
to find them. But it is an indication, both of his attention to detail 
but also his understanding of his responsibility to his colleagues and 
in the body, that every Member, whether they are a long-serving Member 
or a new Member has a chance to participate in the process. And we have 
since used the good work of Senator Cardin as rules, as the chairman of 
the Senate Caucus Rules Committee to help expand democracy, little D, 
in the Democratic caucus.
  Finally, I just want to say that while much has changed over those 58 
years that Senator Cardin has served our State, one thing has remained 
constant--bedrock--and that is the character of Ben Cardin. You will 
not find a person of greater decency, a person of greater integrity 
than Ben Cardin. And whether you agree or disagree with him on any 
particular issue, you always know that the position he has taken is one 
that is based in values and principles that he brings to the debate. 
And for that, we should all be eternally grateful.
  So I know that he will be leaving this body. I have said--as I have 
traveled around the State, I have just been marveling at the fact that 
while Senator Cardin announced that he wasn't running for reelection 
over a year ago, he is running so hard through the finish line. It is 
hard to keep up with him. In fact, he just mentioned that we were at 
one of the Baptist Churches in Baltimore the other day--we had been on 
the Eastern Shore, Western Maryland, all over the State.
  So I want to thank him for that deep commitment he has to our country 
and the State of Maryland. I want to thank his beloved partner and wife 
Myrna Cardin for giving him all that strength over many years. And 
while he will be leaving the Senate, both myself and our incoming 
Senator Angela Alsobrooks know he is only a phone call away. So don't 
turn off your phone too often, Ben Cardin.
  To my colleagues, thank you all for being here to celebrate an 
incredible U.S. Senator, someone we are so proud of in the State of 
Maryland, our friend, my friend Ben Cardin.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, after Senator Ben Cardin announced his 
retirement in the spring of 2023, he and his wonderful wife Myrna 
recorded an extraordinary video reflecting on a life in public service 
nearly as long as their 60 years of marriage.
  Touching on the highlights of a career that ranged from enacting the 
Magnitsky sanctions, about which we have heard so much today, to 
protecting Maryland's precious Chesapeake Bay, Ben said the unifying 
force behind his work has always been tzedakah, the Jewish tradition of 
helping wherever and whenever help is needed.
  Observing Ben for the past 18 years, I have seen a statesman of keen 
intellect and profound decency. He is always guided by the ideals of 
America, his service to Maryland, and by his faith. He consistently has 
demonstrated the character that earned him the trust of the people of 
Maryland from the house of delegates to the third congressional 
district to the U.S. Senate.

[[Page S6901]]

  Ben's hometown newspaper, the Baltimore Sun, described him this way:

       He is a man of substance who understands complicated issues 
     and the art of compromise.

  Having partnered with Ben on initiatives to move our Nation forward, 
I heartily agree with that description. For example, following the 
tumultuous aftermath of the 2020 election, Ben was an essential leader 
in a bipartisan working group that crafted the Electoral Count Reform 
and Presidential Transition Act to better ensure smooth transfers of 
power between Presidential administrations.
  I remember, for example, in one meeting, Ben bringing up a legal 
question that was absolutely essential that we resolve. It was 
indicative of the kind of careful legislating in which he engages.
  As members of the Small Business Task Force, we coauthored the 
Paycheck Protection Program that helped so many businesses and 
employees survive the COVID pandemic.
  From expanding Medicare access to improving home healthcare services 
to addressing opioid use disorder, Ben has been a strong and effective 
leader in healthcare. One of Ben's most enduring legacies will be the 
example, his leadership, as a champion of human rights around the world 
and his fearless persistent dedication to fighting anti-Semitism.
  And one of my most enduring memories of Ben will be standing by his 
side in Tel-Aviv last October following the horrific Hamas attack on 
Israel.
  In the aftermath of that incomprehensible evil, Ben offered words of 
consolation and peace as he made crystal clear that the United States 
will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the State of Israel.
  It is significant that just before our bipartisan delegation traveled 
to Israel, Ben was presented with the Anne Frank Award for Human 
Dignity and Tolerance from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Well 
deserved.
  It has been such an honor to serve with Senator Ben Cardin, a leader 
of integrity, intelligence, and civility. I am so grateful for his 
efforts to strengthen our institutions, to elevate our national 
discourse, and to bring people together to find common ground and solve 
problems.
  I wish Ben and Myrna much happiness in the years to come. You will be 
missed, Ben.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I would like to rise and join some of my 
colleagues in speaking about Ben Cardin, but I perhaps want to take a 
little bit more of a personal approach to sharing my thoughts about my 
departing colleague.
  I don't know if he remembers this, but I was elected in a special 
election, and I came here plopping down, sworn in on the auspicious day 
of Halloween. And I knew I had to meet my colleagues, so I started the 
process of going to their offices. They took me to meet everybody from 
John McCain sitting in his office, obviously, to Harry Reid who was 
here then.
  But my journey to go see Ben Cardin was different than any of my 
other meetings because we sat down, and he asked me about myself, and 
before I knew it, we were talking about Judaism.
  Now, it was an amazing conversation to me because I did not realize 
how deep his faith was, how knowledgeable he was of the Torah, 
something I have been studying for decades as a non-Jew, and I found 
this incredible connection to him around the principles that he spoke 
about at the top of his speech, principles of hesed, principles of 
tzedakah, this idea of living a good and moral life. But what was 
amazing to me over these last 11 years that I have been at the Senate 
is that maybe some joking from time to time about Judaism, but we 
really haven't had much of a Torah discussion as we did on that very 
first day. He has never invited me to a minyan; he and I have never 
prayed together. He never talked to me about his religion. I have 
traveled around the whole world, but that first conversation was the 
most we ever talked about his religion and his faithfulness.
  But what is amazing to me is even though we haven't spoken about it, 
as someone who knows and loves the religion, I will say I have seen it 
in him every single day. In my faith, there is a theologian that says: 
Everywhere you go, preach the gospel, but only sometimes use words.
  I am a big believer that before you tell me about your religion, 
first show it to me in how you treat other people; before you preach to 
me how much you love your God, show it to me in how you love all of 
God's children; before you tell me about your passion for your faith, 
show it to me in your compassion for other people.
  This has been the beauty of serving with my colleague Ben Cardin 
because I have seen through the work and the dedication and the labors 
and the attention to detail and the leadership how deep his integrity 
is and his alignment between his beliefs and how he conducts himself in 
the world.
  And so in honor of that, Ben, I am going to try to do something that 
I am sure has never been done in the history of the Senate is I am 
going to say good-bye to you in a d'var Torah. Now, maybe there has 
been a d'var Torah on the Senate floor, but I am confident in the 
history of America there has never been on the Senate floor a d'var 
Torah given by a big Black goy.
  And so here it is. There is a moment in the Torah where Moses, a 
great leader, has been given the 10 Commandments, but the Jewish people 
are worshipping a golden calf. We all know the story of him crumbling, 
smashing the tablets, but what I didn't know until I started studying 
Judaism and doing Torah studies on Fridays, I didn't know there was a 
moment where God said: OK. I will destroy these people and give you new 
people to lead.
  And what was amazing to me, astonishing to me, about this story from 
the Torah is you would think that devotion, this fealty to God, that 
whatever God says goes, but Judaism struck me when I started studying 
the Torah as a strange faith that all of these major figures get into 
fights with God, whether it was the incredible story of Abraham arguing 
with angels about defending a city, Sodom and Gomorrah. But in this 
moment, what Moses said to God was:
  (English translation of statement made in Hebrew is as follows:)
  If you destroy these people, then erase me from your book. I want no 
part of you, God.
  I have watched you for 11 years. And like that ideal of Moses, 
despite all of the imperfections of humanity, despite our faults and 
our foibles, despite the tragedies we have wrought unto ourselves, you 
have shown that leadership of Moses, not accepting the world's 
happenings as God's will but standing up and standing in the breach.
  You have, through your work, both here in America and across the 
globe, you have been one of those people who has defended the weak, who 
has protected the vulnerable, and who has championed the best of 
humanity.
  Yes, you have preached the gospel, my friend, but you have more 
profoundly dedicated your life to its work. There is an ideal in 
Judaism that we should all be dedicated toward tikkun olam, to healing 
this world.
  I believe there is a God in Heaven. I share your sense of faith, and 
I believe at the end of this chapter of your life, God is saying: Well 
done, my good and faithful servant. And I know God is not done with you 
yet, so as you go on into the world, I simply say, as your brother, 
yasher koach.
  Thank you.
  (Applause.)
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Welch). The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am tempted to simply say: Amen and amen 
to yield back, but I didn't want this moment to pass without rising, on 
behalf of my wife Gayle and me, to say how much we have appreciated the 
friendship of Ben and Myrna Cardin and the leadership that they have 
shown to us as we have represented the United States of America to 
citizens around the world and particularly to our friends in Europe.
  Myrna has been a wonderful friend to Gayle. She is deserving of all 
of the accolades that she has received and will receive.
  I have had an opportunity in this city several times in the last few 
weeks to make remarks on behalf of Ben Cardin. He suggested to me 
almost that he had heard enough and that I need not say anymore. But I 
do want to say how much I appreciate his leadership and the list of 
accomplishments

[[Page S6902]]

that he has listed and to say how grateful I will always be for Ben 
allowing me to be a part of the Magnitsky struggle and getting the 
Magnitsky Act passed and Global Magnitsky, which is renowned around the 
world as an effective tool against totalitarianism and corruption.
  And so I would simply say that people in the audience may have 
happened by--I know a number of people here came for this particular 
purpose--but if you happened simply to be in the Gallery at this 
particular time, you have been--these people, Mr. President, have been 
subject to the testimony of a magnificent public servant. And if I 
serve decades more, which I do not feel that I will, if I live to be 
100, I will not see a finer leader in terms of intellect, talent, in 
terms of savvy, in terms of accomplishment, in terms of leadership and 
statesmanship than I have known in the person of Ben Cardin, and I am 
grateful to have been his colleague and his friend.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.
  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I am incredibly grateful for the 
kind comments that my Senate family has said. I have said that my 
colleagues are my family, and they were certainly a lot less objective 
than my real family has been about some of my legislative actions.
  So, first, to Senator Van Hollen, he pointed out that we work 
together; we trust each other; and we have been able to get more done 
because of it. That trust has never been broken. And the two of us have 
been able to share information. We share a common vision of what we 
want for Maryland and this Nation, and it has made my service in the 
U.S. Senate so much more rewarding knowing that my colleague is a 
person who shares the burdens of our office of representing the people 
of Maryland and takes equal responsibility to make sure we get things 
done in a unified way.
  So, Senator Van Hollen, thank you for those very kind comments, and 
it is mutual. Your leadership here has benefited our State to an 
incredible degree.
  And to Senator Collins, I have been at several bipartisan groups with 
Senator Collins. She has a way of just reaching out and bringing people 
together. And I must tell you, she sort of glossed over what we did in 
response to January 6 and the passage of the electoral college reforms. 
That was not an easy task to get that to the finish line, and Senator 
Collins was the leader on that effort and allowed me to have input 
where it was needed in order to bring people together. But that is what 
she does all the time; she always looks for common ways. There is a 
reason why our appropriators seem to be able to get along through the 
leadership of Senator Murray and Senator Collins. I think it is a real 
example for all of us.
  And then to Rabbi Booker.
  (Laughter.)
  I want to know when he is going to start a synagogue because I am 
going to join that synagogue. I want everyone to know. His d'var Torah 
is a lot better than a lot of Rabbi's d'var Torahs. He is just an 
incredible addition to our Senate family, and I will follow him 
anywhere.
  And to Senator Wicker, you know, what we have been able to do 
together, it has been an incredible run. I have been with you around 
the world. We have stood up to dictators, and we have helped friends. 
We stood by people who had no other help around them so that their 
rights could be heard, and we have gotten a lot done together.
  There is no question that we would not have had the victories on the 
Magnitsky bills without your personal involvement, working within your 
caucus to make sure that it was not politicized and we got it to the 
final line, and you took a lot of hours for us, and I very much 
appreciate that. More importantly, human rights defenders appreciate 
your gallantry in the U.S. Senate to get those bills to the finish line 
and bills that don't have your name on it. As I mentioned, you were 
responsible to make sure we had vehicles to get them completed.
  So I thank you for your friendship. I thank you for Gayle. And it has 
been, as I said, a real pleasure to have that type of relationship.
  I am often asked by my colleagues: Do you ever talk to Republicans? I 
mean, they think we are so divided here, and this is a family. And that 
is why I said in my parting comments, I really see the hope of our 
future in the relationships that have been developed here in the U.S. 
Senate. We can work together. We can resolve these issues. We know what 
our responsibilities are about. We know we have challenges in this 
country, but we also know we need to listen to each other, and that is 
what I think we do here in the Senate. We have got to do it in a more 
effective way. And my colleagues that are with me today have been 
champions in listening to each other to get the work done for the 
American people.
  Mr. President, I am deeply honored to serve in this body, and I thank 
you for your attention.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled 
vote occur immediately.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.

                 Nomination of Cynthia Valenzuela Dixon

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Cynthia Valenzuela Dixon to the U.S. District Court for the Central 
District of California.
  Born in Tucson, AZ, Judge Valenzuela earned her B.A. at the 
University of Arizona in 1991 and her J.D. at the University of 
California at Los Angeles School of Law in 1995. After graduating from 
law school, she worked as special assistant to Vice Chair Cruz Reynoso 
on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights from 1995 to 1998.
  Between 1998 and 2000, Judge Valenzuela served as a trial attorney in 
the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department 
of Justice. From 2000 to 2006, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney 
in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.
  After that, Judge Valenzuela worked at the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, first as the western regional counsel in 
2006 and then as the national vice president and director of litigation 
from 2006 to 2011.
  Between 2011 and 2016, Judge Valenzuela served as the Criminal 
Justice Act supervising attorney on the U.S. District Court for the 
Central District of California.
  Since 2016, Judge Valenzuela has served as a judge on the State Bar 
Court of California. She served as the supervising judge of that court 
from 2020 to 2022.
  The American Bar Association rated Judge Valenzuela as ``qualified,'' 
and her nomination is strongly supported by her home State Senators, 
Mr. Padilla and Ms. Butler.
  Judge Valenzuela's substantial litigation background and service on 
the State Bar Court of California have prepared her to serve as a 
district judge on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of 
California. I am proud to support her nomination.

                               PRESS Act

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my friend Senator Wyden for 
coming to the floor to champion something I have been very supportive 
of and he has carried, the bipartisan PRESS Act, a bill every person in 
this room--whether they are Senators, journalists, citizens--should 
want to see become law.
  No democracy can survive without a free and open and thriving press. 
The free press keeps governments accountable to the people, exposes 
abuse and wrongdoing, informs the public about what is happening in 
government.
  But if government can unduly harass the press or when leaders smear 
journalists as enemies of the people and when there are too few 
protections for journalists, our democracy is at the very real risk of 
eroding away.
  We have seen in some countries--in Hungary, Orban--a dictator tells 
his friends to buy the press so there can be no real freedom and no 
real counterargument. And they do. They buy newspapers, televisions, et 
cetera.
  And so we have to protect the press. It is sacred--sacred--to 
America. The PRESS Act is a commonsense and strongly bipartisan bill to 
ensure journalists can do their job without with facing undue 
harassment.
  I am so proud to support this act. Senate Democrats all support this 
bill. And the bill has already passed the House unanimously. I hope 
every single Senate Republican joins us to pass it today. I know many 
of them are ready to do the right thing. I think it has a majority 
support in both parties.
  This bill, again, is common sense and balanced. It would prohibit the 
Federal Government from using subpoenas or search warrants or other 
measures to force journalists or third parties to reveal confidential 
information without their knowledge. It has exceptions carefully 
tailored to address matters of national security. And it would ensure 
that the decision to seize journalists' records and compel them to 
reveal sources falls to the Federal courts, not to the Department of 
Justice. It is more important now than ever before, when we have heard 
so many in the incoming administration talk about going after the press 
one way or another.
  And 99 percent of the work to enact the PRESS Act into law is already 
done; all we need is for no Senator to stand in the way today.
  So thank you, Senator Wyden, for championing this bill. Thank you to 
the many reporters, news organizations, press leaders, and press 
associations for championing this bill.
  Being a journalist is a hard job. It is hard enough. Journalists 
shouldn't have to fear baseless government harassment on top of that 
for just doing their jobs. So let's pass the bipartisan PRESS Act and 
send it to the President's desk.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me just 
thank the Senate majority leader. We have talked about this often. And 
I am particularly struck by the readings of the Founding Fathers 
because several of the Founding Fathers seem to think that a free press 
was at least as important as government. So the case that you are 
making today, Mr. Leader, is well stated.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, let me thank the Senator from Oregon for his 
leadership. Thank you.








[Pages S6903-S6907]
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]



                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4250

  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in a few minutes, I am going to ask 
unanimous consent to pass my bipartisan bill, the PRESS Act. And this 
legislation is deeply personal to me.
  I am very proud to be the son of Peter Wyden, who was an award-
winning journalist. My dad fled the Nazis in the 1930s, and members of 
his family died at the hands of the Nazis.
  In the United States, my dad became such a good writer, he became 
part of our Army's elite group, the Ritchie Boys, that wrote the 
propaganda pamphlets that we dropped on Nazis.
  Growing up, my dad always mentioned that several of our Founding 
Fathers--as I indicated to the majority leader here--stressed how 
important the free press was to our country. And my dad emphasized how 
important it is that American journalists can do their jobs without 
unneeded government interference.
  So our bipartisan bill shields journalists from being forced by the 
courts to disclose their sources or information provided by their 
sources, with--as the majority leader and I have emphasized--key 
exceptions exist in our legislation for national security and other 
critical matters. And our bill also does not otherwise limit the 
government's ability to pursue leakers.
  So this is so common sense that nearly every State in the country has 
some form of reporters' shield on the books. Democratic and Republican 
State legislators alike have found value in preserving the free flow of 
information and codifying these fundamental freedoms.

  My bill, with Senator Lee--and I want to thank our colleague on the 
other side of the aisle on all his good counsel here. Our bill would 
finally ensure that these protections make it to the Federal level. 
This is a bill--and I note this. My colleague, the Presiding Officer, 
knows that sometimes it is pretty hard around the Congress to be able 
to get folks to agree to order a 7 Up or something. This bill passed 
this House unanimously and has the support of both the chair of the 
Judiciary Committee and ranking member Senator Graham. Not only that, 
but our bill has been endorsed by people from across the political 
spectrum.
  I would say to my friend from Nevada, Tucker Carlson is on board. FOX 
News is on board. This is about as bipartisan as you can get. Past 
administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have exploited the 
lack of a Federal shield law to curtail the freedom of the press and, 
in some cases, even jailed journalists who have refused to break their 
journalistic ethics and reveal their sources.
  It is long overdue that these abuses be stopped. So my substitute 
amendment that I put together with Senator Lee addresses feedback that 
we heard on this Senate floor and elsewhere.
  My colleague from Arkansas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, 
spoke about this before, and we heard feedback from the Department of 
Justice that they wanted some key national security exceptions for 
section 702 and threats to critical infrastructure, and ensuring that 
the Federal Government can still respond to cases that require 
exigency.
  I want it understood that, between the time this came up on the floor 
previously and today, we have reached out for feedback that addresses a 
number of the concerns that I heard from my colleague from Arkansas, a 
member of the Intelligence Committee whom I work with, that I hope 
addresses his concerns.

[[Page S6904]]

  So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of 
H.R. 4250 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; 
further, that the Wyden substitute amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). Is there objection?
  The Senator from Arkansas.
  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, in reserving the right to object, this 
bill is a threat to U.S. national security and an insult to basic 
fairness and the principle of equality before the law. It is the 
biggest giveaway to the liberal press in American history.
  The so-called PRESS Act would turn reporters into a protected class, 
free to hold, share, and publish highly classified and dangerous 
information that no other American is allowed to possess. The passage 
of this bill would turn the U.S. Senate into an active accomplice of 
deep state leakers, traitors, and criminals along with the America-
hating and fame-hungry journalists who help them out. This legislation 
would make it all but impossible to ever compel a reporter to reveal 
their sources or compel them to return classified information in their 
possession.
  Reporters would become the only class of people legally permitted to 
possess classified information in an unsecured and unmonitored 
environment. It gives reporters rights that no other American 
possesses. No Senator even has these protections. In fact, if the 
Senator from Oregon was given unsecured classified information and 
refused to turn it over, he could be censored, prosecuted, and possibly 
put in jail. And we wouldn't want that to happen. We would miss him 
dearly.
  Even former Presidents don't have the rights that this legislation 
provides to liberal journalists. Just remember, the FBI raided 
President Trump's house on the mere accusation that he held unsecured 
classified information. And unlike President Trump, President Biden 
actually committed this crime and only escaped prosecution because the 
prosecutor concluded he was too addled to be convicted. Thanks to this 
bill, reporters at CNN, MSNBC, and the New York Times would have more 
rights and privileges than former Presidents and Vice Presidents.
  This bill would also embolden every leaker and would-be traitor in 
the Federal Government within arm's reach of classified or damaging 
information. Leakers could reveal anything from the placement of 
American troops in foreign countries to the location of nuclear 
weapons, with only the thinnest and hardest to prove exceptions. They 
could release embarrassing or incriminating information from FBI 
background checks. They could also release information provided by 
allied nations, endangering America's alliances around the world. If 
this bill became law, every leaker would sleep well at night knowing 
their accomplices in the media would never have to turn them in.
  The leakers could also release, say, phone records of discussions 
between the President of the United States and foreign leaders, and 
this bill would protect any reporter who released or possessed the 
contents of those calls. Maybe it should be called the ``Alexander 
Vindman Protection Act.''
  Not surprisingly, President Trump recently wrote:

       REPUBLICANS MUST KILL THIS BILL!

  And, for the benefit of those who missed it, he wrote it in all 
capital letters with an exclamation point at the end.
  The bill's advocates often say too much stuff is classified. I agree. 
On the intelligence committee, I am often asked: Why is this 
classified? But some information ought to be classified, and the 
solution to overclassification is to classify less stuff, not to enable 
liberal deep staters to leak to liberal journalists.
  Another argument I hear is government employees often violate the law 
and abuse our citizens--I agree, especially when Democrats are in 
office--but whistleblowers have plenty of legal and effective avenues 
to raise those concerns. If their superiors refuse to listen to them, 
they can contact their Departments' inspectors general or ombudsmen. 
They can also contact congressional oversight committees or Federal law 
enforcement. What they shouldn't do--what the law, in fact, forbids 
them from doing--is run off to the liberal media.
  Even with its present protections, which I think are excessive, the 
liberal media has a long record of endangering our troops and our 
interests around the world. The liberal media doesn't deserve more 
privileges, protections, and perks. Releasing classified information is 
a serious crime, and it should be punished seriously.
  Contrary to what members of the press may think, a press badge 
doesn't make you better than the rest of America or put you above the 
law.

  For several years, the media has conducted itself in a disgraceful 
manner and destroyed its reputation with the American people. Yet some 
in Congress--maybe the only institution less popular than the press--
now want to give it more privileges? I don't think so. My message is 
simple: No one is entitled to the privileges provided in this bill, 
certainly not the press.
  Therefore, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me be brief here.
  This legislation that we have been discussing passed the House of 
Representatives early this year, and it was unanimous. So for people 
who are following the debate, every single Republican--everyone in the 
other body--in effect, approved this legislation.
  Why did they do that? Because it clearly is sensitive to these 
national security concerns. We put in express exceptions for national 
security, including an area my colleague and I know a lot about, 
section 702 of FISA.
  My colleague was very kind to me. He said, gosh, if I wasn't here, he 
would miss me. Well, that is very kind and thoughtful, but what we are 
really missing is the overwhelming support from Republicans for this 
legislation. I spoke about the Members in the other body, and no one 
else is objecting here.
  I just think that, if we look at the writings of the Founding Fathers 
and their importance of a free press, what we ought to be saying is, 
yes, we should be listening to each other. That is why I made those 
changes since the last time my colleague from Arkansas objected. This 
is going to also--and I think my colleague and I would agree on this--
protect citizen journalists who don't have the legal budget to fight 
subpoenas the way big newspapers can. That is why my bill has been 
endorsed by independent journalists like Catherine Herridge.
  I understand that we don't have unanimous consent today. I think it 
is unfortunate. I think America would be stronger and freer if we were 
passing this legislation today, but we will be back, and my hope is 
that we can work with the Senator from Arkansas to get his support.
  I want it understood from the standpoint of good faith that I 
listened the last time. My colleague and I were here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate, and I thought he made good arguments. I am not here to 
say he is without good arguments. That is why I went out and I told our 
staff and all the folks on the Intel Committee and the people who work 
with us on it to make these changes to see if we can come aboard.
  I realize we don't have unanimous consent this afternoon, but I would 
just say to my colleagues this is about as important as it gets. Free 
speech is fundamental to what makes our country so special. I have had 
more than 1,100 townhall meetings at home, and people always come and 
say: I don't agree with you about ``this,'' or I don't agree with you 
about ``that,'' but we are using our First Amendment. We are making 
sure we can always be heard.
  I will tell my colleague, my door is open, and we will be talking to 
your folks to see if we can get this resolved. As I say, I made those 
changes since the last time we were on the floor for the express 
purpose of our being able to see if we could find agreement.
  So I respect my colleague's right to dissent in spite of the fact 
that every single House Republican voted for it, and I am going to be 
coming back and seeing if we can find ways to work it out.
  I yield the floor.

  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator 
from Oregon.
  The Founding Fathers designed the Senate to be the sober second 
thought to the House of Representatives or even transient and fleeting 
public opinion. The Senator from Oregon cited the unanimous vote in the 
House. Sometimes, that is an indication of widespread support for a 
sound and wise policy, but on occasion, it is an indication that a 
rash, impetuous, hasty, impulsive decision by the House deserves a 
sober second thought in the U.S. Senate. And not for the first time, I 
am pleased to provide the sober second thought on this and other 
issues.
  I yield the floor.

 Political Prisoners in Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Vietnam

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, periodically, I have come to the Senate 
floor to raise the issue of political prisoners languishing in jails 
around the world. You would wonder why I do this. Well, it came to my 
attention that there are some real miscarriages of justice in terms of 
these political prisoners, and it also came to my attention that when I 
make a speech on the floor, sometimes people hear it and it makes a 
difference.
  Thanks to the good work of Chris Homan, my chief staffer on this 
project, we have been party to and assisting in many releases of 
prisoners around the world. Some have come to visit me in my office 
here at the Capitol, saying they were languishing in prison and nobody 
even knew they were alive and that I gave a speech and I talked to the 
Ambassador and, the next thing you know, they are home.
  So on the off chance that good fortune will come through again, I am 
going to make this effort this evening and am joined by Senator Welch 
of Vermont.
  There are journalists, activists, opposition candidates, and everyday 
citizens who are too often victims of petty, repressive regimes for 
simply trying to exercise basic democratic freedoms we take for granted 
in this country. Over the years, many of those eventually released have 
come to see me here in DC. Without fail, they say that their jailers 
cruelly tried to make them think they were forgotten and shared how 
sustaining it was to know voices around the world kept attention on 
their plight. So I will raise a few more cases today, and I am glad to 
be joined by my friend, the junior Senator from Vermont Senator Welch, 
who is also taking up this effort.
  I would like to first start with the country of Eritrea--an abysmal 
human rights record in that country. It has the nickname, the 
distinction, of being the North Korea of Africa. Eritrea has been 
ruled, since its independence three decades ago, by President Afwerki, 
whose regime has a well-documented history of arresting or forcibly 
disappearing thousands of political prisoners into secret detention 
centers known for appalling conditions, usually without any charges, 
trial, or sentencing.
  In September 2001, Eritrea banned all independent media and 
arbitrarily arrested journalists for any criticism of the government. 
Let me highlight a few who have been jailed for more than two decades--
two decades: Dawit Isaak, an award-winning Swedish-Eritrean journalist; 
Amanuel Asrat, a distinguished poet and publisher; Seyoum Tsehaye, a 
war journalist and television executive; and, finally, Temesgen 
Gebreyesus, an actor and journalist. All are depicted on this sign.
  They remain imprisoned, along with thousands of Eritreans, under 
unimaginable conditions, with no end in sight. I urge President 
Afwerki: End this madness. Free these political prisoners. It would be 
an important step toward establishing your reputation in the world and 
ending international sanctions and Eritrea's isolation.
  Next, Saudi Arabia, a country with which we have shared many 
interests and also in which unacceptable political repression continues 
to complicate our relationship.
  I have long advocated for the case of writer Raif Badawi--over in 
this corner--who, in 2022, was at last released after spending 10 years 
in a Saudi prison for the crime of exercising his right to free speech. 
Yet, to this day, he remains subject to a cruel travel ban, preventing 
him from reuniting with his family in Canada.
  Waleed Abu al-Khair, a women's rights activist, and Salma al-Shehab 
are other such prisoners. Waleed has been in prison since 2014 for his 
human rights work, and in 2022, Salma was given an outrageous 34-year 
prison sentence for this. Let me tell you what her crime was. Ready? 
She used Twitter. That was it. Enough--34 years; throw away the key.
  For too long, the Saudi Crown Prince has silenced dissidents and pro-
democracy activists while claiming to embrace reform. Such reform 
should include allowing Raif to unite with his family in Canada as well 
as unconditionally releasing Waleed, Salma, and countless other 
political prisoners without delay.
  Next, the Asian country of Tajikistan, which wants to increase 
security and economic cooperation with the United States. As I have 
long said, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
especially for opposition parties, remains critical for countries that 
want a closer relationship with the United States.
  As such, I urged the release of human rights lawyer Buzurgmehr Yorov, 
who is serving 28 years in prison for simply representing Tajikistan's 
legal opposition in court.
  Lastly, I want to focus on the nation of Vietnam, with whom, amid 
China's bullying in the region, the United States has built a 
remarkably good reputation over the years. Yet Vietnam remains at the 
bottom of World Press Freedom Index. In 2024, Vietnam ranked 174th out 
of 180 nations. The Vietnamese Government continues to heavily restrict 
free speech, with too many journalists and human rights defenders 
facing harassment, detention, and harsh prison sentences under so-
called anti-state propaganda laws.
  This includes people like Pham Chi Dung, one of the most popular 
writers on Voice of America's Vietnamese service, who was sentenced to 
15 years in prison in 2021--he helped create the Independent 
Journalists Association of Vietnam--and Pham Doan Trang, considered one 
of the most prominent Vietnamese dissidents, who so far has served 4 
years of a 9-year prison sentence. Just this year, she was awarded PEN 
America's Barbey Freedom to Write Award, adding to an already long list 
of awards from several governments and press freedom groups.
  In 2020, just before her arrest, she wrote very movingly--and I want 
to quote her:

       I don't want freedom for just myself; that's too easy. I 
     want something greater: freedom for Vietnam.

  That is an amazing show of courage. I have seen the same from so many 
other political prisoners around the world, willing to go to prison for 
their freedom.
  Before I turn the floor over to Senator Welch, I want to remind these 
brave individuals in Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Vietnam 
that you are not forgotten. We will continue to advocate for your well-
being and release and speak your names to the world. And when you are 
free, please come visit me here at the Capitol. I will be waiting to 
shake your hand.
  Madam President, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
  Mr. WELCH. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Durbin for his 
ongoing commitment to highlighting the plights of people who have been 
imprisoned for doing nothing more than exercising free speech, for 
doing nothing more than speaking up on behalf of the oppressed in their 
own country, for speaking up on behalf of human rights and justice.
  What Senator Durbin said inspires me, and that is: We don't know what 
the outcome will be. Is anyone paying attention? We don't know, but 
what we do know and we have seen is that this does help and make a 
difference and get some attention on people who were unjustly 
imprisoned for doing something that is noble.
  And our goal here is not always to have everything be instrumental 
immediately, but it is to reassert the commitment that this U.S. Senate 
has to do what is within our power--sometimes it is very limited, as in 
this case of advocacy and attention to highlight and hopefully result 
in the highlighting of an oppressive situation--to

[[Page S6906]]

have a release of a person who has been unjustly detained.
  So I just want to express my gratitude to Senator Durbin. And over 
the years, I have met people who used to be political prisoners and 
were shaking the hand of Senator Durbin. His advocacy made a 
difference. The advocacy of other Members of the Senate makes a 
difference.
  And the most compelling thing for me is just think about what it is 
like to be a person who has made a statement, who used Twitter and you 
are suddenly arrested; you are suddenly cut off from your family; you 
are suddenly cut off from any visitation; you have no idea whether you 
have a future. And you have to feel, day in and day out, in that 
captivity, that people have completely forgotten who you are, that you 
have become invisible.
  So the act of trying to make visible people who, as a result of the 
use of state power, have been made invisible is something that each and 
every one of us should do our best--using this office that we have and 
this forum we have--to stand up and remember people who have been made 
forgotten because they have done decent things.
  I am really grateful to work with Senator Durbin on this, and I want 
to focus attention on other political prisoners.
  The first is Maryia Kalesnikava. Maryia is a professional musician. 
Think about that--a gifted musician. Think of the discipline that goes 
into becoming a professional musician. She was admired throughout 
Belarus for her talents and as a leading member of the political 
opposition. She left aside just being a musician to speak out on behalf 
of her people.
  She called for free and fair elections. Arrest follows. After every 
leading opposition candidate had either been jailed in Belarus or fled 
the country, Maryia was apprehended in 2020 by officials driving an 
unmarked vehicle and taken to the Belarus border, where they attempted 
to forcibly deport her to Ukraine. She wouldn't allow herself to be 
forcibly deported. Think about that. She had to risk coming back when 
she was in the custody of unknown people who had no good intention for 
her. They put her on trial. She was tried, and she was sentenced to 11 
years in a penal colony--11 years--for the crime of calling for free 
and fair elections.
  Her situation is obviously concerning for many reasons, not the least 
of which is that between February 2023 and November 2024--1 year and 9 
months--she was not allowed any visits by her family. I mean, just 
think about that: Your son or your daughter is cut off from you, and 
you have no idea of how they are doing, whether they are alive, are 
they suffering. Only after nearly 600 days was Maryia's father finally 
permitted to visit her last month.
  Now, I am speaking about this with some passion because I met her 
sister just recently. Her sister Tatsiana came to my office, and she 
has been out and about telling her sister's story and seeking for her 
release. Tatsiana was joined in my office by two human rights defenders 
who are courageously working to help secure the release of Maryia and 
other Belarusian political prisoners.
  There have been a small number of Belarusian prisoners convicted of 
``extremism'' who have been released, and I am hopeful that Maryia will 
also be released. And while the United States and Belarus have profound 
disagreements, including over human rights and Russia's illegal 
invasion of Ukraine, I believe that officials of both governments 
should speak respectfully toward each other and seek opportunities to 
work together to address issues of common interest. My hope is that her 
release will be one of them.
  Madam President, secondly, I want to speak about Maykel ``Osorbo'' 
Castillo. Maykel is an Afro-Cuban musician and writer who won a Latin 
Grammy Award while imprisoned in a Cuban jail. How do you do that? He 
won a Latin Grammy while he was in jail. He helped write a hit pro-
democracy anthem that won Song of the Year at the 2021 Latin Grammys.
  One of the things that are so extraordinary about folks like this who 
are illegally, wrongly imprisoned is that it doesn't somehow quell 
their spirit to express themselves and their joy of life.
  Maykel is definitely one of them. He was arrested in May 2021 
following months of police harassment, including intensive 
surveillance, movement restrictions, and ``preventative'' detention. He 
was sentenced a year later on politically motivated charges of evading 
police custody and sharing social media critical of the government.
  Maykel is one of the many who have been unjustly imprisoned, and I 
urge the Cuban Government to release him. I also hope the incoming 
Trump administration will not do what many fear, which is to tighten, 
really, a lot of further sanctions on Cuba even more.
  Finally, I want to mention Dr. Salah Soltan. Salah is a 65-year-old 
U.S. permanent resident, academic scholar, and prisoner of conscience 
in Egypt. Dr. Salah has quite a smile, as you can see. He is a husband, 
he is a father, and he is a grandfather to 11 grandchildren--American 
citizens, by the way--with deep roots in Michigan and the Midwest.
  He has been unjustly imprisoned for 12 years, and he is in fragile 
health. In recent years, there has been growing bicameral, bipartisan, 
domestic, regional, and international support for his release on 
medical and on humanitarian grounds.
  President Sisi has taken some modest steps towards justice for 
political prisoners, including removing more than 700 Egyptians with 
tangential ties to opposition political parties from domestic terrorism 
lists. That is good, what President Sisi did.
  We want him and urge him to release Salah on humanitarian grounds so 
he can rejoin his family in the United States.
  Madam President, these are only three of the tens and probably 
hundreds of thousands of prisoners of conscience in the world. The 
arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of individuals for nothing more than 
peacefully expressing views in support of democracy, in support of 
freedom of expression and other human rights, is abhorrent. These folks 
are accused of all sorts of fabricated charges. And it is really abuse 
of the awesome power of the state to essentially oppress people who are 
critical of the state. These folks are apprehended. They are subjected 
oftentimes to inhumane conditions, often solitary confinement in 
decrepit prisons, without access to lawyers or families. They are 
erased. They become invisible, as Senator Durbin was discussing. Some 
of these folks die in prison from torture or untreated medical 
conditions. So anytime we can raise the possibility of their getting 
some attention so their case can be heard, so they have some 
possibility of release, is a good use of our time.
  The question about why we do it kind of surprises me, actually, 
because the answer is simple. Americans care about people whose 
fundamental rights are denied, and whoever and wherever they are, we 
should continue to express that concern. I am proud to say that 
certainly is a legacy of my predecessor, Senator Patrick Leahy, who 
served in this body for 48 years. In fact, that right is every person's 
responsibility under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which 
no country voted against when it was adopted on December 10, 1948--66 
years ago today.
  I want to finish where I started by thanking my colleague from 
Illinois not just for his advocacy but for his inspiration to all of us 
to do what we can with this office that we hold for whatever period of 
time we have been entrusted to speak out on behalf of wonderful people 
like the people I mentioned and Senator Durbin mentioned.
  I yield to my colleague Senator Durbin.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
  Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my colleague Senator Welch from Vermont. 
He is a great partner in this effort. His heart is in the same place 
mine is.
  One of the things that just struck me that some of the prisoners said 
to me when they came home and made it to the United States, to my 
office--one of them said: You don't realize that your mentioning my 
name on the floor of the U.S. Senate could have saved my life.
  Many of the jailers and oppressive governments that have these people 
imprisoned beat them, torture them, starve them, and believe no one 
knows or no one cares. But if all of a sudden the name of that prisoner 
becomes conversation at the Embassy or at the

[[Page S6907]]

State Department or even in some of the halls of leadership of 
governments around the Nation, they think twice before they hurt them 
or kill them.
  It is hard to imagine that our simple speech on the floor could have 
that impact, but it has. I thank you for joining me in this effort. I 
hope our colleagues will join us as well.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                               GUATEMALA

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to celebrate the 
175th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Guatemala and the 
United States.
  As we mark this milestone, I want to highlight the strength of the 
U.S.-Guatemala bilateral relationship today. Earlier this year, I led a 
congressional delegation to Guatemala, and we met with President 
Bernardo Arevalo. He is a leader who was elected last year by voters 
who were sick of widespread corruption. He ran by focusing on 
corruption and insecurity, as well as generating employment and 
promoting climate change policies. And I was impressed. Prior to 
serving in elected office, Arevalo worked in Guatemala's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. He served as First Secretary and Minister Counselor in 
Israel in the 1980s and as Ambassador to Spain and Deputy Foreign 
Minister in the 1990s. For several years, Arevalo was active as a 
leader in civil society, promoting anticorruption initiatives.
  The Guatemalan President clearly cares--as do I--about upholding the 
rule of law, promoting democratic values, and combatting corruption. I 
believe that Guatemala stands at one of the most pivotal and 
potentially transformative moments since the end of the 1996 civil war.
  But the path it takes going forward will largely depend on the extent 
that President Arevalo is able to govern. I was deeply concerned by 
attempts to undermine his democratic election last year and by the 
concerted efforts by the previous government to obstruct the peaceful 
transfer of power.
  Attorney General Maria Consuelo Porras led the charge in weaponizing 
the justice system against him. She criminalized the President's 
political party. She jailed journalists. She has forced former 
prosecutors and judges investigating corruption into exile. She 
continues to use the Public Ministry to protect her personal financial 
and political interests--working without any practical check on her 
power.
  This makes it difficult to combat corruption, to go after 
transnational crime, and to seek justice for human rights defenders 
persecuted under the previous government.
  And yet despite these challenges, President Arevalo has not given up. 
He hasn't given up on his commitment to rooting out corruption at home, 
as we have seen with the launch of the National Commission Against 
Corruption.
  He has continued to build on our strong economic relationship; the 
U.S. is Guatemala's largest investor and trading partner. Just this 
year, our countries held a High-Level Economic Dialogue with 
discussions across all sectors of society, including private businesses 
and indigenous groups.
  President Arevalo has also continued to have the courage to support 
liberty across the globe. Despite economic coercion by the People's 
Republic of China, he has maintained Guatemala's diplomatic relations 
with Taiwan. And on the question of migration, his government has been 
supportive of the Biden administration's safe mobility office in 
Guatemala. This effort has been critical to reducing irregular 
immigration on our southern border and providing legal pathways to 
vulnerable populations.
  I know we will continue working together to address the root causes 
of migration, whether it is corruption, poverty, violence, crime, or 
climate change.
  Now, I recognize these are immense challenges. And we are going to 
have a new administration coming into office here in the United States 
in January with very different views of America's role in the world--
especially with regards to our relationship to the Western Hemisphere.
  But for those of us who believe deeply in values-based policy making, 
for those of us who understand the importance of democracy and the rule 
of law, for those of for whom respect for human rights is paramount, we 
must not give up.
  Making the world a better place is hard, but it is not impossible. So 
whether you live in Guatemala--or in the United States--let us come 
together in mutual respect to address the challenges we face.
  And let us commit to making the next 175 years of our relationship 
one of prosperity, security, and peace.

                ENDING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO DECEASED ACT

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am announcing my intention to object to 
any unanimous consent request to proceed to S. 2492, the Ending 
Improper Payments to Deceased Act.
  I support my colleagues' efforts to identify opportunities to reduce 
Federal improper payments by indefinitely extending the cooperative 
data exchange agreement between the Social Security Administration and 
the Department of the Treasury's Do Not Pay (DNP) working system, as 
established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (P.L. No. 
116-260). However, this bill rushes to make this data exchange 
permanent without evaluating the efficacy of the data exchange.

[[Page S6908]]

  As my colleagues may know, the purpose of the 2021 law was to expand 
access to the State-owned death information to Federal Agencies for the 
purposes of reducing improper payments while ensuring Social Security 
Administration and States are fully reimbursed for the cost of 
creating, compiling, and maintain the data. To ensure those goals were 
achieved, we established a 3-year trial period so we could evaluate the 
performance, usefulness, and downstream effects of the exchange with 
DNP and to provide us the opportunity to determine the best path 
forward for Federal Agencies' access to State death data.
  As required by law, the SSA-DNP exchange began operating on December 
27, 2023, less than a year ago. In my conversations with the Treasury 
Department and the Social Security Administration, both Agencies 
acknowledged they do not have sufficient data to evaluate the efficacy 
of the data exchange, including whether SSA is fully reimbursed for the 
costs of collecting and maintaining the state death data. Without that 
information, it is difficult to determine whether this exchange is the 
best path forward for Federal Agencies' accessing State death data. For 
these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent request in 
relation to this legislation.

                  TRIBUTE TO C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague, 
and more importantly, my dear friend Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger. 
By any standard, Dutch has had an exceptional career with 38 years in 
public office, beginning when he was first elected to the Baltimore 
County Council in 1985. Even before our time together in Congress, 
Dutch and I shared a common bond as we are both proud graduates of 
Baltimore City College High School. Maryland is grateful to be the home 
of City College as it is our Nation's third oldest public high school 
and its alumni include three Maryland Governors and the late U.S. 
Representative Elijah Cummings.
  Dutch's decision to seek public office began after a serious car 
crash while he was working as a prosecutor a decade earlier which 
nearly claimed his life. Dutch credits the facility now known as the R. 
Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland for two 
things: saving his life and setting him on his political path. I am 
dually grateful to the doctors at the University of Maryland for their 
quick thinking and expertise which has, in turn, presented Dutch with 
the grit, determination, and circumstances to run for office and serve 
11 successful terms in the House of Representatives.
  Dutch is a Marylander through and through, born and educated in 
Baltimore, and his quick rise in the Baltimore County State's Attorney 
office was therefore not surprising. After almost a decade of taking on 
organized crime, drug trafficking, and political corruption in 
Baltimore as a county executive, he was elected to serve as the 
Representative for Maryland's second district in 2002. Dutch 
immediately broke new ground by becoming the first ever Democratic 
freshman to be appointed to the coveted House Intelligence Committee. A 
decade later, Dutch served as the ranking member for the very same 
committee during a tumultuous time for our Nation's national security. 
Dutch, and then House Intelligence Committee chairman   Mike Rogers, 
became the first dual recipients of the William Oliver Baker Award, 
which recognizes excellence in nonpartisan security. The presentation 
of this prestigious award was due to their superb work on the high-
profile Osama bin Laden capture, Benghazi attacks, and Edward Snowden 
leaks.
  Dutch also served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee for 
12 years, now serving on both the Defense and Commerce, Justice, and 
Science Subcommittees. He had previously served on the Armed Services 
Committee, as well as the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
He has been a staunch advocate for community project funding and 
leveraged his role as an appropriator to ensure the Port of Baltimore, 
the Chesapeake Bay, and the local communities received their fair share 
of funding from the hundreds of billions of Federal dollars in which 
the House Appropriations Committee is responsible for each fiscal year. 
I am proud of his dedication to improving the lives of Marylanders at 
every opportunity.
  His support of the local community extends to local governments as 
well. In 2016 Dutch founded the House Municipal Bond Caucus for both 
sides of the aisle to better advocate for the tools local and State 
governments require to fund schools, roads, libraries, local law 
enforcement, and emergency services. Dutch's focus on enhancing the 
quality of life for public servants through legislation promoted by 
this caucus has had a net effect of lower taxes and new jobs for the 
everyday Marylander.
  Maryland's second district was formally home to two Army bases: Fort 
Meade, which houses the codemakers and codebreakers of the National 
Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, and Aberdeen Proving Ground. In 
addition to these bases, Dutch was also responsible for the oversight 
of the U.S. Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, as well as dozens of other 
defense support equities. Dutch also chairs the U.S. Naval Academy's 
Board of Visitors, of which I am also a member, and is the cochair of 
the bipartisan House Army Caucus.
  Dutch has always been a man of action, from his days as a police 
officer during law school, to his time as a lifeguard on the beaches of 
Ocean City, MD--where I am sure he will be spending much of his 
retirement.
  This same drive for action has benefited our Nation's men and women 
in uniform in many ways, like establishing the Peer Reviewed Orthopedic 
Program, which revolutionized the way traumatic combat injuries to 
extremities were treated from troops returning home from the Middle 
East, often saving them from amputation. Dutch also created the 
``Operation Hero Miles'' program in concert with Fisher House after he 
learned that our servicemembers and their families were paying out of 
pocket to visit their wounded or ill loved ones who were undergoing 
treatment at a military or Veteran's Affairs medical center. This 
program allowed any American to donate their frequent flyer miles to 
our Nation's heroes.
  These are just a few of Dutch's many accomplishments, and on behalf 
of our beloved Marylanders and all Americans, I thank him for his 
decades of service. I am equally thankful for the continued friendship 
of Dutch and his wife Kay, and I am thrilled for him to be able to 
spend more time with Kay, his two children, and his five grandchildren. 
Dutch's cheery wit and unwavering patriotism will be missed by me, the 
entire delegation, and in the Halls of Congress. I offer 
congratulations to Dutch on his well-deserved career of public service.

                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN P. SARBANES

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend, 
Congressman   John Sarbanes. Next Congress will be the first without a 
Sarbanes representing Maryland in 54 years. The Sarbanes family will be 
sorely missed in this body.
  I had the great fortune to working with John's father, the late 
Senator Paul Sarbanes, who is referred to as ``The Senator's Senator.'' 
I met Paul when he first ran for public office in 1966. We both were 
elected to the Maryland General Assembly that year, and we became good 
friends. Delegate Sarbanes at that point made a name for himself on the 
house judiciary committee in the Maryland General Assembly and was a 
rising star from his first day in the Maryland General Assembly.
  He shortly thereafter ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, 
where he served three terms, then moved over to the Senate where he 
served for five terms with a very distinguished record. His service in 
the House occurred during the Watergate scandal, and his time in the 
Senate marked by the Enron scandal. During both periods of crisis, 
Senator Sarbanes stepped into the breach as a steady hand to help 
regain the American peoples' confidence in their institutions. Like his 
father, Congressman Sarbanes' legacy in Congress has been focused on 
protecting the integrity of our Nation's most cherished institutions.
  John is the product of a household ethic of public service. That is 
evident in his actions in Congress and how he conducts himself as a 
public official. John shares his father's intellect and

[[Page S6909]]

thoughtful approach to politics. He speaks substantively and honestly, 
and his approachability has made working on behalf of his constituents 
appear second nature. Since he was elected in Congress in 2007, he has 
put his head down and worked hard for the people of Maryland and the 
Nation. He serves on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and 
the Subcommittees on Health; Energy, Climate, and Grid Security; and 
Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Minerals.
  In addition to his environmental record, one of his most notable 
accomplishments has been his long-term work on campaign finance reform 
and voting rights reform. His work on this issue began long before his 
bill, H.R. 1, For the People Act, became a top priority in Congress. 
Indeed, then-Democratic Leader Pelosi appointed John to chair a new 
Democracy Reform Task Force in 2017. The comprehensive legislative 
package John developed would ultimately propose to strengthen 
democratic institutions, enhance Federal ethics standards, and reign in 
unlimited and secret dark-money campaign spending by wealthy and 
powerful special interests. In particular, John was known for promoting 
a matching system for small donations and more effective oversight of 
campaign finance and spending by the Federal Election Commission.
  This legislation ultimately became the Freedom to Vote Act, a 
signature piece of democracy reform legislation in the last few 
Congresses. This transformational anticorruption and clean elections 
reform package builds on his previous efforts to pass H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act.
  On five separate occasions, the House of Representatives passed 
various versions of H.R. 1 and ultimately succeeded in putting these 
issues squarely before the Senate. Unfortunately, in 2022, the Senate 
failed to muster the votes necessary to overcome the filibuster and 
vote on this critical package of reforms.
  In addition to his work on election reform, Congressman Sarbanes has 
demonstrated a lifelong devotion to environmentalism. I have been 
particularly grateful to work with him on the restoration of the 
Chesapeake Bay, which his father famously declared ``the soul of 
Maryland.'' John has led the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Task Force to 
several victories, including securing Federal funding and policy 
changes that support a healthier bay. His Chesapeake Bay legacy, 
however, will be his work to connect more Marylanders to the bay by 
improving access and environmental literacy.
  Congressman Sarbanes saw that many Marylanders lacked meaningful 
experiences with the Chesapeake Bay and worked to expand public access 
to the bay and its tributaries, most dramatically though legislation to 
create a Chesapeake National Recreation Area. He also worked hard to 
expand educational opportunities so that the general public is 
empowered to steward our shared natural resources. His No Child Left 
Inside legislation helps expand outdoor education opportunities for 
students, which provide incredible benefits to students and supports a 
new generation of environmental champions. It has been an honor to work 
with him on Chesapeake Bay issues, which has been close to my heart 
during my time in public office.
  I thank Congressman Sarbanes for his work in Congress and for so 
honorably carrying on his father's legacy as a public servant. He has 
set an outstanding example for Congresswoman-elect Elfreth. I will miss 
working with John, but am grateful for our time in office together and 
wish him success and joy as he enters this new chapter.

                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID TRONE

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to 
acknowledge a colleague of mine and a valued member of Team Maryland, 
Representative   David Trone. Since coming to Congress in 2018, 
Representative Trone has demonstrated a passion for tackling some of 
the most pressing issues that face our country and a persistent drive 
to advocate for the people of western Maryland.
  I am proud to have worked closely with Representative Trone over the 
years to fight for Marylanders on a variety of issues. The progress 
that Representative Trone has made in combatting the opioid crisis 
stands out in my mind as an example of his tenacity and effectiveness.
  Many regions in our country have seen the harm opioid and substance 
use disorders can bring to their communities, and western Maryland is 
no exception. When Representative Trone took office, he made it clear 
to his constituents that this would be a top priority of his.
  He quickly backed it up with action, by hitting the ground running in 
the House of Representatives. Representative Trone launched the 
Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Task Force, 
bringing together more than 140 Members of Congress from across the 
country and aisle. Twenty-six of their bills became law in the 117th 
Congress. Representative Trone serves on the House Appropriations 
Committee, Budget Committee, and the Joint Economic Committee.
  Outside of specific legislative work, Representative Trone has played 
an important role in shifting the narrative to see addiction as a 
disease and a public health crisis, rather than a personal shortcoming. 
That is why he has supported mental health offerings like passing a 
bill to provide confidential mental health support to first responders. 
He worked to expand the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to 
include coverage for first responders whose deaths are a result of 
suicide or are permanently disabled as a result of traumatic service-
related experiences.
  I will miss working with Representative Trone, but I am grateful for 
his service to the Maryland delegation. I wish Representative Trone, 
his wife June, and his entire family only the best going forward. I 
wish him only happiness and success in what follows his career in the 
House. And I thank him for sharing his dedication to Maryland's sixth 
district with the American people and his fellow colleagues.

                          ____________________

                    REMEMBERING DR. CHARLIE McMILLAN

  Mr. LUJAN. Mr. President, I am here today to commemorate a life of 
public service dedicated to the expansion of human knowledge and the 
greater good.
  On September 6 of this year, New Mexico and the Nation suffered a 
tremendous loss as Dr. Charles McMillan tragically passed away.
  Dr. McMillan, or Charlie as he insisted he be called by all who knew 
him, is perhaps best known for his work as a groundbreaking physicist 
and visionary leader of Los Alamos National Laboratory.
  Fittingly, Charlie's early career focused on developing tools and 
diagnostics for eye surgery. His innovations resulted in several 
patents and benefited countless patients.
  Over nearly 20 years at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 
Charlie was instrumental to maintaining and enhancing our Nation's 
security posture, leading experimental physics, and computing programs 
that were critical to modernizing the nuclear stockpile.
  In 2006, Charlie moved to New Mexico and became the tenth director of 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2011. Capturing the Lab's 
achievements under Charlie's leadership would be nearly impossible, but 
one area that shines particularly bright is Charlie's work on 
supercomputing.
  Charlie not only recognized the critical role of these revolutionary 
machines for the advancement of scientific discovery and national 
security, he was able to bring together diverse teams and inspire them 
to execute his ambitious vision: He was instrumental in bringing 
Roadrunner online and acquiring Trinity, two of the fastest 
supercomputers in the world at the time.
  These computers did critical work on nuclear stewardship and 
contributed to scientific advancements in areas ranging from advanced 
battery design to medical drug simulations. The foundations Charlie 
established resonate to this day through the Department of Energy's 
Exascale Program, which continues to host the world's fastest 
supercomputers.
  Charlie retired as director in 2017, but was recently called back to 
the Department to help steward its transition into the next age of 
advanced computing: artificial intelligence. In this capacity, Charlie 
continued to be both

[[Page S6910]]

a visionary leader and a scientist's scientist, serving as the 
connective tissue to unite and inspire the Department during this 
paradigm shift in technology, exactly as he had done so many times in 
the past.
  Charlie's sudden passing came as a devastating shock to the multitude 
of people he touched throughout his life; the Department of Energy and 
the national labs are still reeling from this loss. Charlie dedicated 
his life to his Nation, and always did so with tremendous humility and 
an infectious curiosity.
  But he was so much more than a public servant and scientist; he was a 
dedicated husband, father, and grandfather. He had a passion for the 
outdoors, the night sky, and regularly went backpacking with his family 
to share both. He was also an accomplished musician and shared his 
talents by performing in several local Los Alamos theater productions.
  He is survived by his wife of 47 years Janet Robb McMillan, son Paul 
McMillan and spouse Suzanne Long, daughters Caroline McMillan and 
Katherine McCurry, her spouse Paul McCurry, and their son Oliver 
McCurry.
  Charlie leaves behind an incredible legacy of national service, 
scientific achievement, and deep personal connections. We are proud 
that he chose to make New Mexico his home and grateful for the time he 
spent with us in our community. His significant contributions to the 
world and his generous spirit will be deeply missed by all who knew and 
loved him.

                  REMEMBERING MARTIN COPELAND GRISWOLD

<bullet> Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life 
of Martin Copeland Griswold, who died on November 30, 2024, at the age 
of 92. Martin Copeland was a sixth generation Florida farmer, starting 
his career as a member of the Future Farmers of America with 80 acres 
of land and working his way to serve as FFA State president in 1951-52. 
He was the chief executive officer of Griswold Farms, producing food, 
fiber, and timber on a 4,800-acre family farm, and at the time of his 
death, Copeland was still farming. Copeland also served on the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District governing board for 8 
years. As an influential and dedicated Florida farmer making a 
significant impact in northwest Florida, and across the State, Copeland 
was inducted into the Florida Agriculture Hall of Fame. Martin Copeland 
Griswold of Chumuckla, FL, is survived by his wife of 72 years Winona; 
his children Marty (Diane), Von (Lisa), Vicki (Jeff) Miller, Paul 
(Alesia); 12 grandchildren; 17 great-grandchildren; and three great-
great-grandchildren.<bullet>

                       TRIBUTE TO KATE M. KAUFER

  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Kate M. Kaufer, the 
fearless leader of my defense staff, on more than 20 years of 
distinguished Federal service and on her well-earned retirement.
  For the last 4 years, it has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve 
as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee supporting our 
military and our intelligence community. The subcommittee's unique 
jurisdiction appropriates more than half of the Nation's discretionary 
funding: $852 billion in this year's Senate bill. It is almost 
impossible for any one human being to wrap their arms around such an 
enormous national security enterprise. But I can think of at least one 
exception: Kate M. Kaufer.
  Born in Germany, Kate began her Federal service as a Presidential 
Management Intern for the U.S. Marine Corps in June 2003; she joined 
the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in December 2004. In her 20 
years on the subcommittee, she has managed just about every 
appropriations account and issue in our jurisdiction with an incisive 
hungry analytical mind. Shipbuilding, satellites, intelligence 
activities, research, and innovation--you name it, Kate has left her 
mark. I want to extend my particular thanks to her and her loved ones 
these last 2 years as my clerk, for the late nights and weekends, the 
interrupted family vacations, and the weight of leading an 
indispensable subcommittee.
  Kate exemplifies the unique spirit and culture of our subcommittee. 
Her mantra was always, ``We solve problems.'' In every interaction--
whether with me, my colleagues, or fellow staff--she focused on getting 
real things done, in the most bipartisan way possible. That is quite an 
achievement in Washington these days. In short, she was always an 
upbeat professional of the first order. The Senate will miss her, as 
will this subcommittee.
  In addition, Kate is a tremendous mentor to those around her, 
teaching defense appropriations courses at Georgetown University, 
University of North Carolina, and Defense Acquisition University. She 
somehow also finds the time to be an accomplished triathlete, an avid 
traveler and hiker, and a passionate soccer fan.
  In closing, I wish continued success and happiness to Kate, her 
partner, and her family as she embarks on her next great adventure.

                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

    SENATE RESOLUTION 923--RECOGNIZING THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND 
   CONTRIBUTIONS OF GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY IN ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS, 
 CONDEMNING THE USE OF POLITICAL IMPRISONMENT AS A TOOL OF REPRESSION, 
AND CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS ACROSS THE WORLD IN 
         COMMEMORATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DAY ON DECEMBER 10, 2024

  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Tillis) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:

                              S. Res. 923

       Whereas the Senate passed S. Res. 731, which designated 
     December 10, 2018, as ``Human Rights Day'';
       Whereas December 10, 2024, marks the 76th anniversary of 
     the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a 
     landmark document that established the inalienable rights to 
     which all humans are entitled, regardless of race, color, 
     religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national 
     or social origin, property ownership, birthplace, or other 
     status;
       Whereas, in light of immense difficulties, civil society 
     and civil society organizations contribute to the promotion, 
     protection, and advancement of human rights, democratic 
     governance, and rule of law across the world every day;
       Whereas the state of global human rights and civil 
     liberties has declined during the past 2 decades, with 
     Freedom House notably tracking 18 consecutive years of 
     decline in rights and freedoms around the world;
       Whereas Freedom House reports that political rights and 
     civil liberties in 2023 diminished in 52 countries and 
     improved in only 21 countries;
       Whereas, since 2016, 91 countries have proposed or enacted 
     more than 260 legal measures affecting civil society, of 
     which 72 percent have restricted human rights;
       Whereas increasing restrictions on civil society 
     organizations directly impedes the ability of such 
     organizations to advance human rights advocacy and democracy-
     building work and obstructs the rights of citizens to 
     exercise freedom of speech and assembly;
       Whereas the Department of State estimates that 1,000,000 
     individuals find themselves unjustly behind bars as political 
     prisoners for exercising human rights and fundamental 
     freedoms, because of their race, religion, or ethnicity, or 
     due to their private relationships;
       Whereas political imprisonment is employed by authoritarian 
     actors as a tool for limiting political and social dissent, 
     stifling freedom of expression and assembly, and undermining 
     public participation in free and fair elections;
       Whereas authoritarian countries operate vast networks of 
     political prison camps and labor camps used to 
     indiscriminately detain thousands of individuals;
       Whereas countless political prisoners in these detention 
     facilities are subjected to torture, inhumane conditions, 
     enforced disappearance, or other forms of abuse;
       Whereas, according to Freedom House, throughout 2023, 
     widespread problems with elections, including violence and 
     electoral manipulation, drove deterioration in rights and 
     freedoms across the world, especially in countries that 
     experienced pre- and post-election violence;
       Whereas, in many countries, political opposition figures 
     and civil society members continue to be unjustly detained 
     for their role in demanding free and fair elections and 
     leading peaceful democratic protests in opposition to 
     illiberal regimes;
       Whereas anti-corruption prosecutors and pro-democracy 
     activists are arbitrarily imprisoned on baseless charges for 
     their advocacy of greater judicial independence and 
     transparency in countries where judicial systems are 
     weaponized against human rights advocates;
       Whereas religious minorities, religious freedom advocates, 
     and missionaries are unjustly targeted, detained, and 
     repressed for exercising their freedom to believe or not to 
     believe and advocating for those same freedoms for others;
       Whereas the Department of State has determined that 
     religious minorities continue to be victims of genocides 
     relating to religious freedom;
       Whereas women face significantly higher risks of harassment 
     and imprisonment when participating in civil society and 
     political advocacy and heightened vulnerabilities to mental 
     and physical abuse during arrest, questioning, and 
     imprisonment;
       Whereas authoritarian governments and nonstate actors 
     around the world enforce systems of impunity and 
     discrimination to systematically dismantle women's and girls' 
     access to their civil liberties and imprison female human 
     rights defenders and members of civil society who speak out 
     against such oppression;
       Whereas journalists face political imprisonment for 
     fighting to report the truth, advocating for greater 
     protections for freedom of press, and holding governments 
     accountable to their citizens;
       Whereas during 2023, according to Reporters Without 
     Borders, nearly 800 journalists were jailed and 45 were 
     killed for simply doing their jobs: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) expresses support for Human Rights Day and recognizes 
     its global significance;
       (2) recognizes the critical importance and contributions of 
     global civil society in advancing human rights, democracy, 
     and the rule of law;
       (3) condemns the use of political imprisonment as a tool of 
     repression to restrict civil liberties and human rights;
       (4) calls upon governments that are unjustly detaining 
     individuals for their human rights and civil society advocacy 
     work to immediately and unconditionally release these 
     political prisoners;
       (5) encourages the Department of State to continue robust 
     campaigns to advocate for the release of political prisoners 
     and to leverage all necessary diplomatic tools in support of 
     such advocacy, including by--
       (A) coordinating with other executive agencies on priority 
     cases of political prisoners for any principals or high-level 
     United States officials traveling to specific countries where 
     a known case requires attention or diplomatic intervention;
       (B) working with congressional partners, such as the Senate 
     Human Rights Caucus and the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
     Commission, to coordinate advocacy on priority cases for 
     members of Congress, including advocacy preceding official 
     congressional travel;
       (C) consulting with civil society and nongovernmental 
     organizations in countries with priority political prisoners' 
     cases on plans of engagement and advocacy;
       (D) supporting bilateral and multilateral engagement with 
     allies and like-minded countries on issues involving the 
     global protection of human rights, democratic governance, and 
     the rule of law; and
       (E) working with multilateral organizations and fora to 
     devise joint efforts to advance human rights and democracy; 
     and
       (6) encourages the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and 
     Labor, in collaboration with the Office of the Special 
     Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, to devise joint 
     strategies to deter authoritarian regimes from using their 
     judicial systems (particularly arrests, detentions, and 
     sentencings) as tools to silence dissent or for political 
     leverage.

     by--
       (1) the Patriot Guard Riders; and
       (2) other patriotic escort units, including--
          (A) motorcycle units;
          (B) law enforcement units; and
          (C) first responder units;
       Whereas hundreds of thousands of individuals volunteer each 
     December to help lay veterans' wreaths;

     equipment, and related services to assist in the 
     transportation of wreaths across the United States to more 
     than 4,600 locations;
       Whereas the Senate designated December 16, 2023, as 
     ``Wreaths Across America Day''; and
       Whereas, on December 14, 2024, the Wreaths Across America 
     project will continue the proud legacy of bringing veterans' 
     wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates December 14, 2024, as ``National Wreaths 
     Across America Day'';
       (2) honors--

   CARDIOMYOPATHY HEALTH EDUCATION, AWARENESS, AND RESEARCH, AND AED 
                  TRAINING IN THE SCHOOLS ACT OF 2024

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 6829 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by 
title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 6829) to amend the Public Health Service Act 
     to authorize and support the creation and dissemination of 
     cardiomyopathy education, awareness, and risk assessment 
     materials and resources to identify

[[Page S6935]]

     more at-risk families, to authorize research and surveillance 
     activities relating to cardiomyopathy, and for other 
     purposes.

  There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the 
Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 6829) was ordered to a third reading, was read the 
third time, and passed.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, I have great, great, and wonderful 
news. Just now, after so much work, we have finally reached the end 
zone and are sending the HEARTS Act to the President's desk. We scored 
a touchdown for America's children. Today, the Senate unanimously 
passed the HEARTS Act, and with it, we are giving schools across 
America the tools they need to save lives.
  Just yesterday, I was in Buffalo, NY, at Cheektowaga High School with 
Damar Hamlin and members of the community for this very cause: making 
sure that every school has AEDs and the ability to teach CPR.
  Damar Hamlin's story is a powerful reminder that in a cardiac 
emergency, every minute counts. He learned that when he had his cardiac 
arrest on the football field, and all Americans learn that all the 
time. It is especially true when it comes to our children.
  Over the past few months, Damar and I have worked tirelessly on the 
HEARTS Act so we can increase funding for schools to purchase more AEDs 
and ensure students and staff know how to use them. Many Members in 
both Chambers have likewise worked relentlessly on this bill. It is a 
bipartisan bill, it is a commonsense bill, and most importantly, it is 
a lifesaving bill.
  Mr. President, this bill will save lives. When our young athletes 
have a cardiac arrest or need some other form of CPR, there will be the 
AED equipment at the school, and there will be trained personnel who 
know how to apply the AEDs and CPR. It is going to save lives. It is a 
beautiful thing.
  I have to salute Damar Hamlin. After his bout with cardiac arrest, he 
went forward and said: I have to change this and get the AEDs available 
to everybody. He came and visited me in Washington. I said: I want to 
help. And together, we have been a great team.
  I told Damar that passing this legislation, which has just happened, 
is his first Super Bowl ring; winning the Super Bowl, which I believe 
the Bills will do, will be his second Super Bowl ring.
  With the passage of the HEARTS Act, we are putting AEDs within the 
reach of more schools and children. Studies show that schools with AEDs 
and CPR-trained staff are seven times--seven times--more likely to save 
a life during a cardiac emergency. That statistic is now a promise we 
are making to every parent, every teacher, every student in America, 
that they will have the resources they need.
  I want to thank Damar Hamlin for his courage, his partnership, his 
dedication. He is both a strong man and a humble and modest man, a 
beautiful person. I count him as a friend. He turned a personal tragedy 
into a mission to save others. Again and again, Damar would tell me 
``Let's make history'' on this bill, and today, history is being made.
  I would like to thank the NFL for their support. I would like to 
thank the Buffalo Bills for their support. I would like to thank all of 
those who worked to make this possible. To every colleague here in this 
Chamber who helped get this bill across the finish line and to the 
staff who worked so hard on this bill, especially Gunnar Haberl, a 
proud member of the Bills Mafia--and we went to Cheektowaga High 
School. His father is a PE teacher there, and I met him yesterday as 
well. I can tell you, Mr. Haberl is so proud of what Gunnar has done. 
He is right here. Not Mr. Haberl--Gunnar. Gunnar, as I said, is a proud 
member of the Bills Mafia, who doggedly worked on this piece of 
legislation.
  So today is a good day. Because of the HEARTS Act, more lives will be 
saved, more families will be whole, and more communities will be 
prepared.
  And, of course, go Bills--on to the second Super Bowl ring for Damar.

motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so

     as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States was 
     founded in Columbus, Ohio, in the aftermath of the Spanish-
     American War;
       Whereas, on September 29, 2024, the Veterans of Foreign 
     Wars of the United States will celebrate its 125th 
     anniversary;
       Whereas, since 1899, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the 
     United States and its predecessor organizations have provided 
     voluntary and unselfish service to the Armed Forces, 
     veterans, and the United States by--
       (1) advocating for overarching benefits programs for 
     veterans;
       (2) facilitating veterans transitioning back to civilian 
     society;
       (3) serving the communities in which veterans live; and
       (4) taking a national leadership role on substantive issues 
     important to veterans of the Armed Forces; and
       Whereas the 125th anniversary of the founding of the 
     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States provides an 
     opportunity to recognize, honor, and pay tribute to the 
     nearly 1,000,000 veterans of the Armed Forces represented by 
     the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States who served 
     in combat from World War II to the present day: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That Congress--
       (1) expresses support for the designation of September 29, 
     2024, as ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States 
     Day'';
       (2) recognizes the historic significance of the 125th 
     anniversary of the founding of the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
     of the United States and congratulates the organization on 
     achieving that milestone;
       (3) commends the nearly 1,000,000 veterans who belong to 
     the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and thanks 
     those veterans for their service to their fellow veterans and 
     the United States; and
       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     September 29, 2024, with appropriate ceremonies, programs, 
     and activities.

  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS AND TRANSMITTAL FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
                                APPROVAL

                                          U.S. Congress, Office of


                               Congressional Workplace Rights,

                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2024.
     Hon. Patty Murray,
     President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate,
     The United States Capitol, Washington, DC.
       Dear Madam President: Section 207(d) of the Congressional 
     Accountability Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1316b(d), requires the 
     Board of Directors of the Office of Congressional Workplace 
     Rights (Board) to issue substantive regulations implementing 
     section 207 of the CAA relating to the Fair Chance to Compete 
     for Jobs Act of 2019.
       Section 304(b)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(3), requires 
     that, with regard to substantive regulations under the CAA, 
     after the Board has published a general notice of proposed 
     rulemaking as required by subsection (b)(1) and received 
     comments pursuant to subsection (b)(2), ``the Board shall 
     adopt regulations and shall transmit notice of such action 
     together with a copy of such regulations to the Speaker of 
     the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of 
     the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the 
     first day on which both Houses are in session following such 
     transmittal.''
       The Board has adopted the regulations in the Notice of 
     Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Transmittal for 
     Congressional Approval, which accompany this transmittal 
     letter. The Board requests that the accompanying Notice be 
     published in the Senate version of the Congressional Record 
     on the first day on which both Houses are in session 
     following receipt of this transmittal. The Board has adopted 
     the same regulations for the Senate, the House of 
     Representatives, and the other covered entities and 
     facilities, and therefore recommends that the adopted 
     regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the 
     Congress.
       Any inquiries regarding this notice should be addressed to 
     Martin J. Crane, Executive Director of the Office of 
     Congressional Workplace Rights, Room LA-200, 110 Second 
     Street SE, Washington, DC 20540-1999; 202-724-9250.
           Sincerely,

                                       Barbara Childs Wallace,

                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,
                         Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.

 FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE 
                                 RIGHTS

  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS AND TRANSMITTAL FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
                                APPROVAL

Regulations Implementing Certain Substantive Rights and Protections for 
    Job Applicants, as Required by Section 207 of the Congressional 
                     Accountability Act (``CAA'').

   Notice of Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Submission for 
        Approval as Required by 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b of the CAA.

     Procedural Summary:
     Issuance of the Board's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
       The Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019 (``FCA'') 
     was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for 2020 (H. Rept. 116-333, Title XI, Sections 1121-1124). 
     Under the FCA, Federal employers (including employing offices 
     in the legislative branch) may not request from most job 
     applicants information on arrest and conviction history until 
     a conditional job offer has been extended. Congress applied 
     the FCA to the legislative branch by amending the CAA to add 
     a new section 207, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b.
       On June 13, 2024, the Board of Directors (``Board'') of the 
     Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (``OCWR'') published 
     a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the 
     Congressional Record. 170 Cong. Rec. H4056-02, S4091-04 
     (daily ed. June 13, 2024). The NPR proposed substantive 
     regulations relating to implementation of the FCA in the 
     legislative branch. The Board, now having considered comments 
     to the NPR, has adopted, and is submitting for approval by 
     the Congress, final substantive regulations implementing 
     section 207 of the CAA.
     Why did the Board propose these substantive regulations?
       Section 207(d) of the CAA requires the Board to issue 
     substantive regulations implementing section 207. Section 
     207(d) requires the Board's regulations to be:
       the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the 
     Director of the Office of Personnel Management . . . except 
     to the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause 
     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a 
     modification of such regulations would be more effective for 
     the implementation of the rights and protections under this 
     section.
     What procedure followed the Board's Notice of Proposed 
         Rulemaking?
       The NPR included a 30-day comment period, which began on 
     June 13, 2024. The Board received three sets of comments to 
     the proposed substantive regulations. The Board has reviewed 
     these comments, made certain changes to its proposed 
     substantive regulations in response to the comments, adopted 
     final substantive regulations, and is submitting them for 
     approval by Congress pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 
     U.S.C. Sec. 1384.
     What is the effect of the Board's adoption of these 
         substantive regulations?
       Adoption of these substantive regulations by the Board does 
     not complete the promulgation process. Pursuant to section 
     304, following the Board's adoption of the regulations, it 
     must transmit notice of such action together with the 
     regulations and a recommendation regarding the method for 
     Congressional approval of the regulations to the Speaker of 
     the House and President Pro Tempore of the Senate for 
     publication in the Congressional Record. This Notice of 
     Adoption of Substantive Regulations and Submission for 
     Congressional Approval completes this step.
     What are the next steps in the process of promulgation of 
         these regulations?
       Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, the Board is 
     required to ``include a recommendation in the general notice 
     of proposed rulemaking and in the regulations as to whether 
     the regulations should be approved by resolution of the 
     Senate, by resolution of the House of Representatives, by 
     concurrent resolution, or by joint resolution.'' The Board 
     has adopted the same regulations for the Senate, the House of 
     Representatives, and the other covered entities and 
     facilities, and the Board recommends that the adopted 
     regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the 
     Congress.
     Are these substantive regulations also recommended by OCWR's 
         Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director for the 
         Senate, and the Deputy Executive Director for the House 
         of Representatives?
       As required by section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, these 
     substantive regulations are recommended by the Deputy 
     Director for the Senate in regard to regulations under 
     subsection (a)(2)(B)(i), the Deputy Director for the House of 
     Representatives in regard to regulations under subsection 
     (a)(2)(B)(ii), and the Executive Director for regulations 
     under subsection (a)(2)(B)(iii).
     Has the Board previously adopted substantive regulations 
         implementing 
         2 U.S.C. Sec. 1316b?
       No.
     Are these substantive regulations available to persons with 
         disabilities in an alternate format?
       This Notice is available on the OCWR's website, 
     www.ocwr.gov, which is compliant with Section 508 of the 
     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794d. 
     This Notice can also be made available in large print, 
     braille, or other alternative format. Requests for this 
     Notice in an alternative format should be made to the Office 
     of Congressional Workplace Rights, 202-724-9250 (voice); 202-
     426-1913 (fax); or ADAaccess@ocwr.gov (e-mail).
     The Board's Responses to Comments Received
       The Board received comments from three sources. The 
     comments addressed four major points, and one commenter also 
     proposed a number of minor corrections, most of which the 
     Board has incorporated.
     Political Appointees
       The FCA directs the Office of Personnel Management 
     (``OPM'') to issue regulations identifying positions in the 
     executive branch with respect to which the prohibitions under 
     subsection (a) of the Act shall not apply. OPM's substantive 
     regulations thus provide at 5 CFR Sec. 920.201(b)(2) that 
     such prohibitions shall not apply with respect to an 
     applicant for a ``political appointment.'' OPM's regulations 
     define ``political appointment'' at 5 CFR Sec.  920.101:

[[Page S6938]]

       Political appointment means an appointment by the President 
     without Senate confirmation (except those appointed under 5 
     CFR 213.3102(c)); an appointment to a position compensated 
     under the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5312 through 5316); an 
     appointment of a White House Fellow to be assigned as an 
     assistant to a top-level Federal officer (5 CFR 213.3102(z)); 
     a Schedule C appointment (5 CFR 213.3301, 213.3302); a 
     noncareer, limited term, or limited emergency Senior 
     Executive Service appointment (5 CFR part 317, subpart F); an 
     appointee to serve in a political capacity under agency-
     specific authority; and a provisional political appointment.
       In the NPR, the Board did not include a parallel exception 
     for political appointments in the legislative branch, noting 
     the lack of hiring authorities for political appointees 
     comparable to those cited by OPM for the executive branch.
       Two commenters, however, urged the Board to include an 
     exception for ``political appointments'' in the legislative 
     branch, contending that the omission of such a definition 
     would expand the scope of the FCA for the legislative branch 
     beyond its scope in the executive branch, in a manner 
     inconsistent with section 207(b)(1)(A) of the CAA.
       Both commenters referenced OPM's reasoning for its own 
     exception as set forth in its notice of proposed rulemaking:
       The Fair Chance Act applies to applicants to positions in 
     the ``civil service,'' which, under 5 U.S.C. 2101(1), extends 
     to ``all appointive positions'' in the executive branch. 
     Proposed paragraph (b) makes an exception for applicants for 
     political appointments, since political appointees provide 
     confidential, policy-determining, or policy-advocating 
     functions on behalf of the President or presidentially-
     appointed agency heads, and serve as personal advisors and 
     representatives to the President and other senior 
     administration officials. Pre-employment criminal history 
     screening may be required for these positions prior to a 
     conditional offer of employment, because of the utmost trust 
     and discretion required in these positions and the potential 
     for adverse publicity associated with unfit applicants.
     Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs, 87 Fed. Reg. 24885-01, 24894 
     (Apr. 27, 2022).
       The commenters also stressed the inherently political 
     nature of congressional employment, noting that many 
     appointees are hired to perform confidential, policy-
     determining, and policy-advocating functions on behalf of 
     Members of Congress. One commenter noted in particular that 
     section 502 of the CAA explicitly allows consideration of 
     ``party affiliation'' and ``political compatibility with the 
     employing office'' for employment with a committee, a member, 
     or a number of other offices in the House or Senate. Another 
     commenter argued that a definition of ``political 
     appointment'' was necessary to ``ensure employing office 
     employees have pre-offer access to applicant criminal history 
     information on par with Executive Branch employees' access to 
     such information.''
       Upon further consideration, the Board agrees with the 
     commenters that good cause exists to modify rather than omit 
     OPM's exception for applicants for political appointments. 
     The Board therefore includes for adoption in its substantive 
     regulations the following definition:
       Political appointment means an appointment to a position in 
     an employing office defined in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9)(A)-(C) 
     that requires the incumbent to: (1) file a report under title 
     I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 
     Sec. 101 et seq.); or (2) perform confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions equivalent to 
     those performed by Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 
     Sec. Sec. 5312 through 5316) or Schedule C (5 CFR Sec. Sec.  
     213.3301-213.3302) appointees in the executive branch.

                                 * * *

       920.201(b)(2). The prohibition under this paragraph (a) 
     shall not apply with respect to an applicant for a political 
     appointment.
       Subparagraph (1) of this definition exempts appointments to 
     employing offices of the House and the Senate listed in 2 
     U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9)(A)-(C) that require the incumbent to file 
     a financial disclosure report under title I of the Ethics in 
     Government Act--the defining characteristic of ``senior 
     staff'' under the CAA. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1416(d)(7). This 
     filing requirement applies to congressional employees whose 
     rate of pay is 120% of the minimum rate of pay for GS-15 of 
     the General Schedule and to individuals who are designated as 
     a ``principal assistant.'' See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  13101, 
     13103. In the Board's view, exempting all such highly-
     compensated senior staff positions in the House and the 
     Senate is on par with OPM's across-the-board exemptions for 
     appointments by the President without Senate confirmation; 
     appointments to a position compensated under the Executive 
     Schedule; and Schedule C appointments.
       Because not all positions performing confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions in the House and 
     Senate fall under the Ethics in Government Act, subparagraph 
     (2) sets forth a functional test to determine whether a non-
     senior staff position falls within the exception for 
     applicants for political appointments. Such positions that 
     require incumbents to perform confidential, policy-
     determining, or policy-advocating functions that are the 
     equivalent to duties of positions under the Executive 
     Schedule or positions appointed under Schedule C would also 
     be excepted political appointments. No commenters contended 
     that a political appointment exception should apply to 
     appointments to employing offices outside of those in the 
     House and Senate. Accordingly, this exception only extends to 
     appointments to employing offices defined in 2 U.S.C. Sec.  
     1301(9)(A)-(C).
     Sensitive National Security Positions
       The FCA, by reference to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 9101(b)(1)(A)(ii) in 
     5 U.S.C. Sec. 9202(c)(1)(A), created an exception for an 
     appointment to sensitive national security duties or 
     positions. OPM included the exception in its section 
     920.201(b)(1)(iii) regulations for any position that:
       Has been designated as a sensitive position under the 
     Position Designation System issued by OPM and the Office of 
     Director of National Intelligence, which describes in greater 
     detail agency requirements for designating positions that 
     could bring about a material adverse effect on the national 
     security.
       The Board was not aware of any positions in the legislative 
     branch that were so designated. However, at the urging of the 
     commenters, the Board has adopted the following exception, 
     incorporating an alternative test for whether a position can 
     be considered ``sensitive'':
       Has been designated as a sensitive position under the 
     Position Designation System issued by OPM and the Office of 
     Director of National Intelligence (or similar authority in 
     the legislative branch), which describes in greater detail 
     agency requirements for designating positions that could 
     bring about a material adverse effect on the national 
     security, or that requires the performance of duties 
     consistent with a national security position as defined in 5 
     CFR Sec. 1400.102.
     Posting Requirement
       OPM's regulations require agencies to publicize the FCA's 
     requirements in its job postings. The Board proposed a 
     similar regulation at section 920.201(c) for job postings in 
     the legislative branch. Two commenters noted, however, that 
     the statutory authority for OPM's regulation is derived from 
     5 U.S.C. Sec. 9203. Because the CAA only incorporates 
     Sec. Sec. 9201(1), (4), and (5), 9202, 9204, and 9206 of 
     title 5, we agree that the Board lacks the statutory 
     authority to adopt such a regulation. Accordingly, we have 
     removed proposed section 920.201(c) from these regulations.
     Definition of Criminal History Record Information
       One commenter urged the Board to revise its definition of 
     ``criminal history record information,'' in section 920.101 
     rather than follow OPM's definition, which merely cited 
     section 9101. The Board does not find good cause to modify 
     OPM's definition.

     Subpart B--Timing of Inquiries Regarding Criminal History
     Sec. 920.201. Limitations on criminal history inquiries.
       (a) Applicability. An employee of an employing office may 
     not request, in oral or written form (including through the 
     Declaration for Federal Employment (Office of Personnel 
     Management Optional Form 306) or any similar successor form, 
     the USAJOBS internet website, or any other electronic means) 
     that an applicant for employment with an employing office 
     disclose criminal history record information regarding the 
     applicant before the employing office extends a conditional 
     offer to the applicant. This includes the following points in 
     the recruitment and hiring process:
       (1) Initial application, through a job opportunity 
     announcement on USAJOBS, or through any recruitment/public 
     notification such as on the employing office's website/social 
     media, etc.;
       (2) After an employing office receives an initial 
     application through its back-end system, through shared 
     service providers/recruiters/contractors, or orally or via 
     email and other forms of electronic notification; and
       (3) Prior to, during, or after a job interview. This 
     prohibition applies to employing office personnel, including 
     when they act through shared service providers, contractors 
     (acting on behalf of the employing office) involved in the 
     employing office's recruitment and hiring process, or 
     automated systems (specific to the employing office or

     under paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply with 
     respect to an applicant for an appointment to a position:
       (i) Which is exempt in accordance with Sec. 920.102(b);
       (ii) That requires a determination of eligibility for

     bring about a material adverse effect on the national 
     security, or that requires the performance of duties 
     consistent with a national security position as defined in 5 
     CFR Sec. 1400.102.
       (iv) Is a Federal law enforcement officer position meeting 
     the definition in section 115(c) of title 18, U.S. Code.
       (2) The prohibition under paragraph (a) of this section 
     shall not apply with respect to an applicant for a political 
     appointment.

       (a) An employing office employee may not request, orally or 
     in writing, information about an applicant's criminal history 
     prior to making a conditional offer of employment to that 
     applicant unless the position is exempted or excepted in 
     accordance with Sec. 920.201(b).
       (b) A violation (or prohibited action) as defined in 
     paragraph (a) of this section occurs when an employing office 
     employee (or employing office personnel, shared service 
     providers, or contractors acting at the direction of an 
     employing office employee) involved in the employing office's 
     recruitment and hiring process, either personally or through 
     automated systems (specific to the employing office or 
     governmentwide), make oral or written requests of an 
     applicant or applicants prior to giving a conditional offer 
     of employment as a covered employee--
       (1) In a job opportunity announcement on USAJOBS or in any 
     recruitment/public notification such as on the employing 
     office's website or social media;
       (2) In communications sent after an employing office 
     receives an initial application, through an employing 
     office's talent acquisition system, shared service providers/
     recruiters/contractors, orally or in writing (including via 
     email and other forms of electronic notification); or
       (3) Prior to, during, or after a job interview or other 
     applicant assessment.
       (c) When a prohibited request, announcement, or 
     communication is publicly posted or simultaneously 
     distributed to multiple applicants, it constitutes a single 
     violation.
       (d) Any violation as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
     section is subject to the claim and penalty procedures under 
     subchapter IV of title 2 (other than section 1407 or 1408 of 
     title 2, or a provision of this subchapter that permits a 
     person to obtain a civil action or judicial review) and the 
     OCWR Procedural Rules, consistent with these regulations.
